1801.00020;K-theory and actions on Euclidean retracts;This note surveys axiomatic results for the Farrell-Jones Conjecture in terms of actions on Euclidean retracts and applications of these to GL_n(Z), relative hyperbolic groups and mapping class groups.;math.KT
1801.00023;Exceptional sets for nonuniformly hyperbolic diffeomorphisms;For a surface diffeomorphism, a compact invariant locally maximal set $W$ and some subset $A\subset W$ we study the $A$-exceptional set, that is, the set of points whose orbits do not accumulate at $A$. We show that if the Hausdorff dimension of $A$ is smaller than the Hausdorff dimension $d$ of some ergodic hyperbolic measure, then the topological entropy of the exceptional set is at least the entropy of this measure and its Hausdorff dimension is at least $d$. Particular consequences occur when there is some a priori defined hyperbolic structure on $W$ and, for example, if there exists an SRB measure.;math.DS
1801.00024;On the topological equivalence of S-metric and cone S-metric spaces;The aim of this paper is to establish the equivalence between the concepts of an $S$-metric space and a cone $S$-metric space using\ some topological approaches. We introduce a new notion of $TVS$-cone $S$-metric space using some facts about topological vector spaces. We see that the known results on cone $S$-metric spaces (or $N$-cone metric spaces) can be directly obtained from the studies on $S$-metric spaces.;math.GN
1801.00028;Smooth quotients of abelian varieties by finite groups;We give a complete classification of smooth quotients of abelian varieties by finite groups that fix the origin. In the particular case where the action of the group $G$ on the tangent space at the origin of the abelian variety $A$ is irreducible, we prove that $A$ is isomorphic to the self-product of an elliptic curve and $A/G\simeq \mathbb P^n$. In the general case, assuming $\dim(A^G)=0$, we prove that $A/G$ is isomorphic to a direct product of projective spaces.;math.AG
1801.00029;Graded Expectations: Betti numbers and anti-lecture hall compositions of random threshold graphs;This paper examines the one-to-one-to-one correspondence between threshold graphs, Betti numbers of quotients of polynomial rings by 2-linear ideals, and anti-lecture hall compositions. In particular, we establish new explicit combinatorial mappings between each of these classes of objects and calculate the expected values of the Betti numbers and anti-lecture hall composition corresponding to a random threshold graph.;math.CO
1801.00032;On uniqueness of end sums and 1-handles at infinity;For oriented manifolds of dimension at least 4 that are simply connected at infinity, it is known that end summing is a uniquely defined operation. Calcut and Haggerty showed that more complicated fundamental group behavior at infinity can lead to nonuniqueness. The present paper examines how and when uniqueness fails. Examples are given, in the categories TOP, PL and DIFF, of nonuniqueness that cannot be detected in a weaker category (including the homotopy category). In contrast, uniqueness is proved for Mittag-Leffler ends, and generalized to allow slides and cancellation of (possibly infinite) collections of 0- and 1-handles at infinity. Various applications are presented, including an analysis of how the monoid of smooth manifolds homeomorphic to R^4 acts on the smoothings of any noncompact 4-manifold.;math.GT
1801.00033;Concerning $q$-summable Szlenk index;For each ordinal $\xi$ and each $1\leqslant q&lt,\infty$, we define the notion of $\xi$-$q$-summable Szlenk index. When $\xi=0$ and $q=1$, this recovers the usual notion of summable Szlenk index. We define for an arbitrary weak$^*$-compact set a transfinite, asymptotic analogue $\alpha_{\xi,p}$ of the martingale type norm of an operator. We prove that this quantity is determined by norming sets and determines $\xi$-Szlenk power type and $\xi$-$q$-summability of Szlenk index. This fact allows us to prove that the behavior of operators under the $\alpha_{\xi,p}$ seminorms passes in the strongest way to injective tensor products of Banach spaces. Furthermore, we combine this fact with a result of Schlumprecht to prove that a separable Banach space with good behavior with respect to the $\alpha_{\xi,p}$ seminorm can be embedded into a Banach space with a shrinking basis and the same behavior under $\alpha_{\xi,p}$, and in particular it can be embedded into a Banach space with a shrinking basis and the same $\xi$-Szlenk power type. Finally, we completely elucidate the behavior of the $\alpha_{\xi,p}$ seminorms under $\ell_r$ direct sums. This allows us to give an alternative proof of a result of Brooker regarding Szlenk indices of $\ell_p$ and $c_0$ direct sums of operators.;math.FA
1801.00034;Mean field matching and TSP in pseudo-dimension 1;Recent work on optimization problems in random link models has verified several conjectures originating in statistical physics and the replica and cavity methods. In particular the numerical value 2.0415 for the limit length of a traveling salesman tour in a complete graph with uniform $[0,1]$ edge lengths has been established. <br />In this paper we show that the crucial integral equation obtained with the cavity method has a unique solution, and that the limit ground state energy obtained from this solution agrees with the rigorously derived value. Moreover, the method by which we establish uniqueness of the solution turns out to yield a new completely rigorous derivation of the limit.;math.PR
1801.00037;On linear sections of the spinor tenfold, I;We discuss the geometry of transverse linear sections of the spinor tenfold $X$, the connected component of the orthogonal Grassmannian of 5-dimensional isotropic subspaces in a 10-dimensional vector space equipped with a non-degenerate quadratic form. In particular, we show that as soon as the dimension of a linear section of $X$ is at least 5, its integral Chow motive is of Lefschetz type. We discuss classification of smooth linear sections of $X$ of small codimension, in particular we check that there is a unique isomorphism class of smooth hyperplane sections and exactly two isomorphism classes of smooth linear sections of codimension 2. Using this, we define a natural quadratic line complex associated with a linear section of $X$. We also discuss the Hilbert schemes of linear spaces and quadrics on $X$ and its linear sections.;math.AG
1801.00038;Identifiability of two-component skew normal mixtures with one known component;We give sufficient identifiability conditions for estimating mixing proportions in two-component mixtures of skew normal distributions with one known component. We consider the univariate case as well as two multivariate extensions: a multivariate skew normal distribution (MSN) by Azzalini and Dalla Valle (1996) and the canonical fundamental skew normal distribution (CFUSN) by Arellano-Valle and Genton (2005). The characteristic function of the CFUSN distribution is additionally derived.;math.ST
1801.00039;Inverse scattering for the massive Thirring model;We consider the massive Thirring model in the laboratory coordinates and explain how the inverse scattering transform can be developed with the Riemann-Hilbert approach. The key ingredient of our method is to transform the corresponding spectral problem to the equivalent forms: one is suitable for the spectral parameter at the origin and the other one is suitable for the spectral parameter at infinity. Global solutions to the massive Thirring model are recovered from the reconstruction formulae at the origin and at infinity.;math.AP
1801.00043;Network Deployment for Maximal Energy Efficiency in Uplink with Multislope Path Loss;This work aims to design the uplink (UL) of a cellular network for maximal energy efficiency (EE). Each base station (BS) is randomly deployed within a given area and is equipped with $M$ antennas to serve $K$ user equipments (UEs). A multislope (distance-dependent) path loss model is considered and linear processing is used, under the assumption that channel state information is acquired by using pilot sequences (reused across the network). Within this setting, a lower bound on the UL spectral efficiency and a realistic circuit power consumption model are used to evaluate the network EE. Numerical results are first used to compute the optimal BS density and pilot reuse factor for a Massive MIMO network with three different detection schemes, namely, maximum ratio combining, zero-forcing (ZF) and multicell minimum mean-squared error. The numerical analysis shows that the EE is a unimodal function of BS density and achieves its maximum for a relatively small density of BS, irrespective of the employed detection scheme. This is in contrast to the single-slope (distance-independent) path loss model, for which the EE is a monotonic non-decreasing function of BS density. Then, we concentrate on ZF and use stochastic geometry to compute a new lower bound on the spectral efficiency, which is then used to optimize, for a given BS density, the pilot reuse factor, number of BS antennas and UEs. Closed- form expressions are computed from which valuable insights into the interplay between optimization variables, hardware characteristics, and propagation environment are obtained.;cs.IT
1801.00044;Cyclic descents for near-hook and two-row shapes;A notion of cyclic descents on standard Young tableaux (SYT) of rectangular shape was introduced by Rhoades, and extended to certain skew shapes by the last two authors. The cyclic descent set restricts to the usual descent set when the largest value is ignored, and has the property that the number of SYT of a given shape with a given cyclic descent set $D$ is invariant under cyclic shifts of the entries of $D$. Following these results, the existence of cyclic descent sets for standard Young tableaux of any skew shape other than a ribbon was conjectured by the authors, and recently proved by Adin, Reiner and Roichman. Unfortunately, the proof does not provide a natural definition of the cyclic descent set for a specific tableau. <br />In this paper we explicitly describe cyclic descent sets and resulting generating functions for SYT of (possibly skew) shapes which either have exactly two rows or are near-hooks, i.e., are one cell away from a hook. Our definition provides a constructive combinatorial proof of the existence of cyclic descent sets for these shapes, and coincides with that of Rhoades for two-row rectangular shapes. We also show that cyclic descent sets for near-hook shaped tableaux are unique.;math.CO
1801.00045;Webs of type Q;We introduce web supercategories of type Q. We describe the structure of these categories and show they have a symmetric braiding. The main result of the paper shows these diagrammatically defined monoidal supercategories provide combinatorial models for the monoidal supercategories generated by the supersymmetric tensor powers of the natural supermodule for the Lie superalgebra of type Q.;math.RT
1801.00051;Stability Analysis of Coupled Structural Acoustics PDE Models under Thermal Effects and with no Additional Dissipation;In this study we consider a coupled system of partial differential equations (PDE's) which describes a certain structural acoustics interaction. One component of this PDE system is a wave equation, which serves to model the interior acoustic wave medium within a given three dimensional chamber $% \Omega $. This acoustic wave equation is coupled on a boundary interface ($% \Gamma _{0}$) to a two dimensional system of thermoelasticity: this thermoelastic PDE comprises a structural beam or plate equation, which governs the vibrations of flexible wall portion $\Gamma _{0}$ of the chamber $\Omega $, the elastic dynamics is coupled to a heat equation which also evolves on $\Gamma _{0}$, and which imparts a thermal damping onto the entire structural acoustic system. As we said, the interaction between the wave and thermoelastic PDE components takes place on the boundary interface $% \Gamma _{0}$, and involves coupling boundary terms which are above the level of finite energy. We analyze the stability properties of this coupled structural acoustics PDE model, in the absence of \ any additive feedback dissipation on the hard walls $\Gamma _{1}$ of the boundary $\partial \Omega $. Under a certain geometric assumption on $\Gamma _{1}$, an assumption which has appeared in the literature in conection with structural acoustic flow, and which allows for the invocation of a recently derived microlocal boundary trace estimate, we show that classical solutions of this thermally damped structural acoustics PDE decay uniformly to zero, with a rational rate of decay.;math.AP
1801.00053;From analytical mechanical problems to rewriting theory through M. Janet;This note surveys the historical background of the Gr\"obner basis theory for D-modules and linear rewriting theory. The objective is to present a deep interaction of these two fields largely developed in algebra throughout the twentieth century. We recall the work of M. Janet on the algebraic analysis on linear partial differential systems that leads to the notion of involutive division. We present some generalizations of the division introduced by M. Janet and their relations with Gr\"obner basis theory.;math.HO
1801.00057;Preservation of Trees by semidirect Products;We show that the semidirect product of a group $C$ by $A*_D B$ is isomorphic to the free product of $A\rtimes C$ and $B\rtimes C$ amalgamated at $D\rtimes C$, where $A$, $B$ and $C$ are arbitrary groups. Moreover, we apply this theorem to prove that any group $G$ that acts without inversion on a tree $T$ that possesses a segment $\Gamma$ for its quotient graph, such that, if the stabilizers of the vertex set $\{\,P,Q\,\}$ and edge $y$ of a lift of $\, \Gamma$ in $T$ are of the form $G_{P}\!\rtimes H$, $G_{Q}\!\rtimes H$ and $G_{y}\! \rtimes H$, then $G$ is isomorphic to the semidirect product of $H$ by $(\,G_P \,*_{G_y} \,G_Q \,)$. <br />Using our results we conclude with a non-standard verification of the isomorphism between $GL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ and the free product of the dihedral groups $D_4$ and $D_6$ amalgamated at their Klein-four group.;math.GR
1801.00058;A simple mathematical model for unemployment: a case study in Portugal with optimal control;We propose a simple mathematical model for unemployment. Despite its simpleness, we claim that the model is more realistic and useful than recent models available in the literature. A case study with real data from Portugal supports our claim. An optimal control problem is formulated and solved, which provides some non-trivial and interesting conclusions.;math.OC
1801.00066;Normally hyperbolic surfaces based finite-time transient stability monitoring of power system dynamics;In this paper, we develop a methodology for finite time rotor angle stability analysis using the theory of normal hyperbolic surfaces. The proposed method would bring new insights to the existing techniques, which are based on asymptotic analysis. For the finite time analysis we have adopted the Theory of normally hyperbolic surfaces. We have connected the repulsion rates of the normally hyperbolic surfaces, to the finite time stability. Also, we have characterized the region of stability over finite time window. The parallels have been drawn with the existing tools for asymptotic analysis. Also, we have proposed a model free method for online stability monitoring.;math.OC
1801.00068;Contingency Analysis of Power Networks : A System Theoretic Approach;In this work, we have proposed a system theoretic method to compute sensitivities of different lines for $N-k$ contingency analysis in power network. We have formulated the $N-k$ contingency analysis as the stability problem of power network with uncertain links. We have derived a necessary condition for stochastic stability of the power network with the link uncertainty. The necessary condition is then used to rank order the contingencies. We have shown due to interaction between different uncertainties the ranking can substantially change. The state of the art $N-k$ contingency analysis does not consider the possibility of interference between link uncertainties and rank the links according to the severity of $N-1$ contingencies. We have presented simulation results for New England $39$ bus system as a support of our claim.;math.OC
1801.00070;Sum of squares certificates for stability of planar, homogeneous, and switched systems;We show that existence of a global polynomial Lyapunov function for a homogeneous polynomial vector field or a planar polynomial vector field (under a mild condition) implies existence of a polynomial Lyapunov function that is a sum of squares (sos) and that the negative of its derivative is also a sum of squares. This result is extended to show that such sos-based certificates of stability are guaranteed to exist for all stable switched linear systems. For this class of systems, we further show that if the derivative inequality of the Lyapunov function has an sos certificate, then the Lyapunov function itself is automatically a sum of squares. These converse results establish cases where semidefinite programming is guaranteed to succeed in finding proofs of Lyapunov inequalities. Finally, we demonstrate some merits of replacing the sos requirement on a polynomial Lyapunov function with an sos requirement on its top homogeneous component. In particular, we show that this is a weaker algebraic requirement in addition to being cheaper to impose computationally.;math.OC
1801.00072;Invariant submanifolds for affine control systems;Given an affine control system $\dot{\mathbf x} = f({\mathbf x}) + \sum_{j=1}^m g_j({\mathbf x}) u_j$ we present an algorithmic process of construction of submanifolds that are invariant under controls assuming that the linear span of $f, g_1, \ldots, g_m$ has constant rank. We use the method of reduction of Pfaffian systems to a largest integrable subsystem and finding the first integrals and the generalized first integrals for the vector fields.;math.DS
1801.00079;HDG-POD Reduced Order Model of the Heat Equation;We propose a new hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) model order reduction technique based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). We consider the heat equation as a test problem and prove error bounds that converge to zero as the number of POD modes increases. We present 2D and 3D numerical results to illustrate the convergence analysis.;math.NA
1801.00081;Validity of formal expansions for singularly perturbed competition-diffusion systems;We consider a two-species competition-diffusion system involving a small parameter $\varepsilon&gt,0$ and discuss the validity of formal asymptotic expansions of solutions near the sharp interface limit $\varepsilon\approx0$. We assume that the corresponding ODE system has two stable equilibria. As in the scalar Allen--Cahn equation, it is known that the motion of the sharp interfaces of such systems is governed by the mean curvature flow with a driving force. The formal expansion also suggests that the profile of the transition layers converges to that of a traveling wave solution as $\varepsilon\rightarrow0$. In this paper, we rigorously verify this latter ansatz for a large class of initial data. <br />The proof relies on a rescaling argument, the super--subsolution method and a Liouville type theorem for eternal solutions of parabolic systems. Roughly speaking, the Liouville type theorem states that any eternal solution that lies between two traveling waves is itself a traveling wave. The same Liouville type theorem was established for the scalar Allen--Cahn equation by Berestycki and Hamel. In view of their importance, we prove the Liouville type theorems in a rather general framework, not only for two-species competition-diffusion systems but also for $m$-species cooperation-diffusion systems possibly with time periodic or spatially periodic coefficients.;math.AP
1801.00082;An HDG Method for Distributed Control of Convection Diffusion PDEs;We propose a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method to approximate the solution of a distributed optimal control problem governed by an elliptic convection diffusion PDE. We derive optimal a priori error estimates for the state, adjoint state, their fluxes, and the optimal control. We present 2D and 3D numerical experiments to illustrate our theoretical results.;math.NA
1801.00088;On optimal periodic dividend and capital injection strategies for spectrally negative L&#xe9,vy models;De Finetti's optimal dividend problem has recently been extended to the case dividend payments can only be made at Poisson arrival times. This paper considers the version with bail-outs where the surplus must be nonnegative uniformly in time. For a general spectrally negative L\'evy model, we show the optimality of a Parisian-classical reflection strategy that pays the excess above a given barrier at each Poisson arrival times and also reflects from below at zero in the classical sense.;math.PR
1801.00089;Essential dimension of finite groups in prime characteristic;Given a finite smooth group scheme $G$ over a field of characteristic $p &gt, 0$, we show that the essential dimension of $G$ at $p$ is $0$ when $p$ does not divide the order of $G$, and $1$ when it does.;math.GR
1801.00097;Hidden constructions in abstract algebra. Krull Dimension of distributive lattices and commutative rings;We present constructive versions of Krull's dimension theory for commutative rings and distributive lattices. The foundations of these constructive versions are due to Joyal, Espa\~nol and the authors. We show that the notion of Krull dimension has an explicit computational content in the form of existence (or lack of existence) of some algebraic identities. We can then get an explicit computational content where abstract results about dimensions are used to show the existence of concrete elements. This can be seen as a partial realisation of Hilbert's program for classical abstract commutative algebra.;math.AC
1801.00099;Null structures and degenerate dispersion relations in two space dimensions;Motivated by water-wave problems, in this paper we consider a class of nonlinear dispersive PDEs in 2D with cubic nonlinearities, whose dispersion relations are radial and have vanishing Guassian curvature on a circle. For such a model we identify certain null structures for the cubic nonlinearity, which suffice in order to guarantee global scattering solutions for the small data problem. Our null structures in the power-type nonlinearity are weak, and only eliminate the worst nonlinear interaction. Such null structures arise naturally in some water-wave problems.;math.AP
1801.00104;Global attractors for the damped nonlinear wave equation in unbounded domains;The existence of a global attractor for wave equations in unbounded domains is a challenging problem due to the non-compactness of the Sobolev embeddings. To overcome this difficulty, some authors have worked with weighted Sobolev spaces which restrict the choice of the initial data. Using the "tail estimation method" introduced by B. Wang for reaction diffusion equations, we establish in this paper the existence of a global attractor for two wave equations in the traditional Hilbert spaces $\displaystyle H^1(\Omega)\times L^2(\Omega)$ where $\Omega$ is an unbounded domain of $\R^N$. The first equation, with a mass term is studied in the whole space $\R^N$ and the second one without mass term is considered in a domain bounded in only one direction so that Poincar\'e inequality will hold.;math.AP
1801.00106;Content Placement in Cache Networks Using Graph-Coloring;Small cell densification is one of the effective ideas addressing the demand for higher capacity in cellular networks. The major problem faced in such networks is the wireless backhaul link and its limited capacity. Caching most popular files in the memories of small cells base station (SBSs) is an effective solution to this problem. One of the main challenges in caching is choosing the files that are going to be stored in the memory of SBS. In this paper, we model the described caching problem as a graph. This graph is divided into four sub-graphs including placement, access, SBSs and delivery graphs. By making some modifications to the SBS graph, we convert it to a graph that can be colored. Coloring of the generated graph is NP-hard and we use an algorithm proposed in graph-coloring area to color it. To overcome the complexity of above coloring technique, we then propose a simple graph-coloring method based on two point processes, Matern Core-type I and II. We model our network with a new weighted graph which simply can be colored and after that the files are cached accordingly. We evaluate the performance of our proposed methods through simulations. Our results show that by employing out proposed method in a typical considered SBSs network, the load on the macro base station can be reduced by around $25 \%$, at the distribution parameter of popularity of files equals to $0.6$, compared to conventional policy which caches the most popular content every where.;cs.IT
1801.00107;Quasi-units as orthogonal projections;The notion of quasi-unit has been introduced by Yosida in unital Riesz spaces. Later on, a fruitful potential theoretic generalization was obtained by Arsove and Leutwiler. Due to the work of Eriksson and Leutwiler, this notion also turned out to be an effective tool by investigating the extreme structure of operator segments. This paper has multiple purposes which are interwoven, and are intended to be equally important. On the one hand, we identify quasi-units as orthogonal projections acting on an appropriate auxiliary Hilbert space. As projections form a lattice and are extremal points of the effect algebra, we conclude the same properties for quasi-units. Our second aim is to apply these results for nonnegative sesquilinear forms. Constructing an order preserving bijection between operator- and form segments, we provide a characterization of being extremal in the convexity sense, and we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the greatest lower bound of two forms. Closing the paper we revisit some statements by using the machinery developed by Hassi, Sebesty\'en, and de Snoo. It will turn out that quasi-units are exactly the closed elements with respect to the antitone Galois connection induced by parallel addition and subtraction.;math.FA
1801.00109;Finite field analogue of restriction theorem for general measures;We study restriction problem in vector spaces over finite fields. We obtain finite field analogue of Mockenhaupt-Mitsis-Bak-Seenger restriction theorem, and we show that the range of the exponentials is sharp.;math.CA
1801.00111;Inverting non-invertible trees;If a graph has a non-singular adjacency matrix, then one may use the inverse matrix to define a (labeled) graph that may be considered to be the inverse graph to the original one. It has been known that an adjacency matrix of a tree is non-singular if and only if the tree has a unique perfect matching, in this case the determinant of the matrix turns out to be $\pm 1$ and the inverse of the tree was shown to be `switching-equivalent' to a simple graph [C. Godsil, Inverses of Trees, Combinatorica 5 (1985), 33--39]. Using generalized inverses of symmetric matrices (that coincide with Moore-Penrose, Drazin, and group inverses in the symmetric case) we prove a formula for determining a `generalized inverse' of a tree.;math.CO
1801.00113;A generalization of Neumann&#x27,s Question;Let $G$ be a group, $m\geq2$ and $n\geq1$. We say that $G$ is an $\mathcal{T}(m,n)$-group if for every $m$ subsets $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_m$ of $G$ of cardinality $n$, there exists $i\neq j$ and $x_i \in X_i, x_j \in X_j$ such that $x_ix_j=x_jx_i$. In this paper, we give some examples of finite and infinite non-abelian $\mathcal{T}(m,n)$-groups and we discuss finiteness and commutativity of such groups. We also show solvability length of a solvable $\mathcal{T}(m,n)$-group is bounded in terms of $m$ and $n$.;math.GR
1801.00117;A New Sparsification and Reconstruction Strategy for Compressed Sensing Photoacoustic Tomography;Compressed sensing (CS) is a promising approach to reduce the number of measurements in photoacoustic tomography (PAT) while preserving high spatial resolution. This allows to increase the measurement speed and to reduce system costs. Instead of collecting point-wise measurements, in CS one uses various combinations of pressure values at different sensor locations. Sparsity is the main condition allowing to recover the photoacoustic (PA) source from compressive measurements. In this paper we introduce a new concept enabling sparse recovery in CS PAT. Our approach is based on the fact that the second time derivative applied to the measured pressure data corresponds to the application of the Laplacian to the original PA source. As typical PA sources consist of smooth parts and singularities along interfaces the Laplacian of the source is sparse (or at least compressible). To efficiently exploit the induced sparsity we develop a reconstruction framework to jointly recover the initial and the modified sparse source. Reconstruction results with simulated as well as experimental data are given.;math.NA
1801.00120;Asymptotic expansion of Skorohod integrals;Asymptotic expansion of the distribution of a perturbation $Z_n$ of a Skorohod integral jointly with a reference variable $X_n$ is derived. We introduce a second-order interpolation formula in frequency domain to expand a characteristic functional and combine it with the scheme developed in the martingale expansion. The second-order interpolation and Fourier inversion give asymptotic expansion of the expectation $E[f(Z_n,X_n)]$ for differentiable functions $f$ and also measurable functions $f$. In the latter case, the interpolation method connects the two non-degeneracies of variables for finite $n$ and $\infty$. Random symbols are used for expressing the asymptotic expansion formula. Quasi tangent, quasi torsion and modified quasi torsion are introduced in this paper. We identify these random symbols for a certain quadratic form of a fractional Brownian motion and for a quadratic from of a fractional Brownian motion with random weights. For a quadratic form of a Brownian motion with random weights, we observe that our formula reproduces the formula originally obtained by the martingale expansion.;math.PR
1801.00121;Resource Allocation for Downlink NOMA Systems: Key Techniques and Open Issues;This article presents advances in resource allocation (RA) for downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems, focusing on user pairing (UP) and power allocation (PA) algorithms. The former pairs the users to obtain the high capacity gain by exploiting the channel gain difference between the users, while the later allocates power to users in each cluster to balance system throughput and user fairness. Additionally, the article introduces the concept of cluster fairness and proposes the divideand- next largest difference-based UP algorithm to distribute the capacity gain among the NOMA clusters in a controlled manner. Furthermore, performance comparison between multiple-input multiple-output NOMA (MIMO-NOMA) and MIMO-OMA is conducted when users have pre-defined quality of service. Simulation results are presented, which validate the advantages of NOMA over OMA. Finally, the article provides avenues for further research on RA for downlink NOMA.;cs.IT
1801.00123;Frobenius manifolds and quantum groups;We introduce isomonodromy Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) connections with respect to the quantum Stokes matrices, and prove that the classical limit of the KZ type connections gives rise to the Dubrovin connections of semisimple Frobenius manifolds and flat F-manifolds.;math-ph
1801.00124;Escaping Fatou components of transcendental self-maps of the punctured plane;We study the iteration of transcendental self-maps of $\mathbb{C}^*:=\mathbb{C}\setminus \{0\}$, that is, holomorphic functions $f:\mathbb{C}^*\to\mathbb{C}^*$ for which both zero and infinity are essential singularities. We use approximation theory to construct functions in this class with escaping Fatou components, both wandering domains and Baker domains, that accumulate to $\{0,\infty\}$ in any possible way under iteration. We also give the first explicit examples of transcendental self-maps of $\mathbb{C}^*$ with Baker domains and with wandering domains. In doing so, we developed a sufficient condition for a function to have a simply connected escaping wandering domain. Finally, we remark that our results also provide new examples of entire functions with escaping Fatou components.;math.DS
1801.00131;On the structure of zero-sum free set with minimum subset sums in abelian groups;Let $G$ be an additive abelian group and $S\subset G$ a subset. Let $\Sigma(S)$ denote the set of group elements which can be expressed as a sum of a nonempty subset of $S$. We say $S$ is zero-sum free if $0 \not\in \Sigma(S)$. It was conjectured by R.B.~Eggleton and P.~Erd\"{o}s in 1972 and proved by W.~Gao et. al. in 2008 that $|\Sigma(S)|\geq 19$ provided that $S$ is a zero-sum free subset of an abelian group $G$ with $|S|=6$. In this paper, we determined the structure of zero-sum free set $S$ where $|S|=6$ and $|\Sigma(S)|=19$.;math.CO
1801.00137;Frequency-driven market mechanisms for optimal dispatch in power networks;This paper studies real-time bidding mechanisms for economic dispatch and frequency regulation in electrical power networks. We consider a market administered by an independent system operator (ISO) where a group of strategic generators participate in a Bertrand game of competition. Generators bid prices at which they are willing to produce electricity. Each generator aims to maximize their profit, while the ISO seeks to minimize the total generation cost and to regulate the frequency of the system. We consider a continuous-time bidding process coupled with the swing dynamics of the network through the use of frequency as a feedback signal for the negotiation process. We analyze the stability of the resulting interconnected system, establishing frequency regulation and the convergence to a Nash equilibrium and optimal generation levels. The results are verified in the IEEE 14-bus benchmark case.;math.OC

We show that, contrary to the autonomous systems on the compact interval, positivity of topological sequence entropy and occurrence of Li-Yorke chaos are not equivalent, more precisely, neither of the two possible implications is true.;math.DS
1801.00140;Moment measures and stability for Gaussian inequalities;Let $\gamma$ be the standard Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and let $\mathcal{P}_{\gamma}$ be the space of probability measures that are absolutely continuous with respect to $\gamma$. We study lower bounds for the functional $\mathcal{F}_{\gamma}(\mu) = {\rm Ent}(\mu) - \frac{1}{2} W^2_2(\mu, \nu)$, where $\mu \in \mathcal{P}_{\gamma}, \nu \in \mathcal{P}_{\gamma}$, ${\rm Ent}(\mu) = \int \log\bigl( \frac{\mu}{\gamma}\bigr) d \mu$ is the relative Gaussian entropy, and $W_2$ is the quadratic Kantorovich distance. The minimizers of $\mathcal{F}_{\gamma}$ are solutions to a dimension-free Gaussian analog of the (real) K\"ahler-Einstein equation. We show that $\mathcal{F}_{\gamma}(\mu) $ is bounded from below under the assumption that the Gaussian Fisher information of $\nu$ is finite and prove a priori estimates for the minimizers. Our approach relies on certain stability estimates for the Gaussian log-Sobolev and Talagrand transportation inequalities.;math.FA
1801.00143;Paired wreaths: towards a 2-categorical atlas of cross products;After we introduced biwreaths and biwreath-like objects in our previous paper, in the present one we define paired wreaths. In a paired wreath there is a monad $B$ and a comonad $F$ over the same 0-cell in a 2-category $\K$, so that $F$ is a left wreath around $B$ and $B$ is a right cowreath around $F$, and moreover, $FB$ is a bimonad in $\K$. The corresponding 1-cell $FB$ in the setting of a biwreath and a biwreath-like object was not necessarilly a bimonad. We obtain a 2-categorical version of the Radford biproduct and Sweedler's crossed (co)product, that are on one hand, both a biwreath and a biwreath-like object, respectively, and on the other hand, they are also paired wreaths. We show that many known crossed (bi)products in the literature are special cases of paired wreaths, including cocycle cross product bialgebras of Bespalov and Drabant in braided monoidal categories. This is a part of a project of constructing a kind of a 2-categorical atlas of all the known crossed (bi)products. We introduce a Hopf datum in $\K$ which contains part of the structure of a paired wreath. We define Yang-Baxter equations and naturality conditions of certain distributive laws in $\K$ and study when Hopf data are paired wreaths. From the notion of a Hopf datum new definitions of Yetter-Drinfel`d modules, (co)module (co)monads, 2-(co)cycles and (co)cycle twisted (co)actions in a 2-categorical setting are suggested.;math.QA
1801.00144;Ground-state energy of one-dimensional free Fermi gases in the thermodynamic limit;We study the ground-state energy of one-dimensional, non-interacting fermions subject to an external potential in the thermodynamic limit. To this end, we fix some (Fermi) energy $\nu&gt,0$, confine fermions with total energy below $\nu$ inside the interval $[-L,L]$ and study the shift of the ground-state energy due to the potential $V$ in the thermodynamic limit $L\to\infty$. We show that the difference $\mathcal{E}_L(\nu)$ of the two ground-state energies with and without potential can be decomposed into a term of order one (leading to the Fumi-term) and a term of order $1/L$, which yields the so-called finite size energy. We compute both terms for all possible boundary conditions explicitly and express them through the scattering data of the one-particle Schr\"odinger operator $-\Delta +V$ on $L^2(\mathbb R)$.;math-ph
1801.00145;Dynamic Interference Steering in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks;With the development of diverse wireless communication technologies, interference has become a key impediment in network performance, thus making effective interference management (IM) essential to accommodate a rapidly increasing number of subscribers with diverse services. Although there have been numerous IM schemes proposed thus far, none of them are free of some form of cost. It is, therefore, important to balance the benefit brought by and cost of each adopted IM scheme by adapting its operating parameters to various network deployments and dynamic channel conditions. <br />We propose a novel IM scheme, called dynamic interference steering (DIS), by recognizing the fact that interference can be not only suppressed or mitigated but also steered in a particular direction. Specifically, DIS exploits both channel state information (CSI) and the data contained in the interfering signal to generate a signal that modifies the spatial feature of the original interference to partially or fully cancel the interference appearing at the victim receiver. By intelligently determining the strength of the steering signal, DIS can steer the interference in an optimal direction to balance the transmitter's power used for IS and the desired signal's transmission. DIS is shown via simulation to be able to make better use of the transmit power, hence enhancing users' spectral efficiency (SE) effectively.;cs.IT
1801.00149;Inverse Exponential Decay: Stochastic Fixed Point Equation and ARMA Models;We study solutions to the stochastic fixed point equation $X\stackrel{d}{=}AX+B$ when the coefficients are nonnegative and $B$ is an "inverse exponential decay" (IED) random variable. We provide theorems on the left tail of $X$ which complement well-known tail results of Kesten and Goldie. We generalize our results to ARMA processes with nonnegative coefficients whose noise terms are from the IED class. We describe the lower envelope for these ARMA processes.;math.PR
1801.00150;On a scenario of onset of strongly dissipative mixed dynamics;In this paper we present the scenario of the occurrence of strongly dissipative mixed dynamics in two-dimensional reversible diffeomorphisms, using as an example the system describing a motion of two point vortices under the influence of wave perturbation and shear flow. For mixed dynamics of this type the chaotic attractor intersects with the chaotic repeller, but their intersection forms a "thin" set. The main stage of this scenario is the appearance of homoclinic structures for a symmetric saddle orbit which arise after crisis of a homoclinic attractor and repeller.;math.DS
1801.00151;Monads on projective varieties;We generalise Fl\o{}ystad's theorem on the existence of monads on the projective space to a larger set of projective varieties. We consider a variety $X$, a line bundle $L$ on $X$, and a base-point-free linear system of sections of $L$ giving a morphism to the projective space whose image is either arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay (ACM), or linearly normal and not contained in a quadric. We give necessary and sufficient conditions on integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ for a monad of type \[ 0\to(L^\vee)^a\to\mathcal{O}_{X}^{\,b}\to L^c\to0 \] to exist. We show that under certain conditions there exists a monad whose cohomology sheaf is simple. We furthermore characterise low-rank vector bundles that are the cohomology sheaf of some monad as above. <br />Finally, we obtain an irreducible family of monads over the projective space and make a description on how the same method could be used on an ACM smooth projective variety $X$. We establish the existence of a coarse moduli space of low-rank vector bundles over an odd-dimensional $X$ and show that in one case this moduli space is irreducible.;math.AG

1801.00156;Higher topological Hochschild homology of periodic complex K-theory;We describe the topological Hochschild homology of the periodic complex $K$-theory spectrum, $THH(KU)$, as a commutative $KU$-algebra: it is equivalent to $KU[K(\mathbb{Z},3)]$ and to $F(\Sigma KU_{\mathbb{Q}})$, where $F$ is the free commutative $KU$-algebra functor on a $KU$-module. Moreover, $F(\Sigma KU_{\mathbb{Q}})\simeq KU \vee \Sigma KU_{\mathbb{Q}}$, a square-zero extension. In order to prove these results, we first establish that topological Hochschild homology commutes, as an algebra, with localization at an element. <br />Then, we prove that $THH^n(KU)$, the $n$-fold iteration of $THH(KU)$, i.e. $T^n\otimes KU$, is equivalent to $KU[G]$ where $G$ is a certain product of integral Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces, and to a free commutative $KU$-algebra on a rational $KU$-module. We prove that $S^n \otimes KU$ is equivalent to $KU[K(\mathbb{Z},n+2)]$ and to $F(\Sigma^n KU_{\mathbb{Q}})$. We describe the topological Andr\'e-Quillen homology of $KU$.;math.AT
1801.00157;On the uniqueness of solutions to quadratic BSDEs with non-convex generators;In this paper we prove some uniqueness results for quadratic backward stochastic differential equations without any convexity assumptions on the generator. The bounded case is revisited while some new results are obtained in the unbounded case when the terminal condition and the generator depend on the path of a forward stochastic differential equation. Some of these results are based on strong estimates on $Z$ that are interesting on their own and could be applied in other situations.;math.PR
1801.00158;Symmetry breaking for representations of rank one orthogonal groups II;For a pair $(G,G')=(O(n+1,1), O(n,1))$ of reductive groups, we investigate intertwining operators (symmetry breaking operators) between principal series representations $I_\delta(V,\lambda)$ of $G$, and $J_\epsilon(W,\nu)$ of the subgroup $G'$. The representations are parametrized by finite-dimensional representations $V,W$ of $O(n)$ respectively of $O(n-1)$, characters $\delta$, $\varepsilon$ of O(1), and $\lambda, \nu \in C$. <br />The multiplicty [V:W] of W occurring in the restriction $V|_{O(n-1)}$ is either 0 or 1. If $[V:W] \ne 0$ then we construct a holomorphic family of symmetry breaking operators and prove that dim $Hom_{G'}(I_{\delta}(V, \lambda)|_{G'}, J_{\epsilon}(W, \nu))$ is nonzero for all the parameters $\lambda$, $\nu$ and $\delta$, $\epsilon$, whereas if [V:W] = 0 there may exist sporadic differential symmetry breaking operators. <br />We propose a "classification scheme" to find all matrix-valued symmetry breaking operators explicitly,and carry out this program completely when V and W are exterior tensor representations. In conformal geometry, our results yield the complete classification of conformal covariant operators from differential forms on a Riemannian manifold X to those on a submanifold Y in the model space $(X, Y) = (S^n, S^{n-1})$. <br />We use these results to determine symmetry breaking operators for any pair of irreducible representations of G and the subgroup $G'$ with trivial infinitesimal character. Furthermore we prove the multiplicity conjecture by Gross and Prasad for tempered principal series representations of $(SO(n+1,1),SO(n,1))$ and also for 3 tempered representations $\Pi, \pi, \varpi$ of $SO(2m+2,1)$, $SO(2m+1,1)$ and $SO(2m,1)$ with trivial infinitesimal character. In connection to automorphic form theory, we apply our main results to find "periods" of irreducible representations of the Lorentz group having nonzero (g, K)-cohomologies.;math.RT
1801.00163;On the cone of $f$-vectors of cubical polytopes;What is the minimal closed cone containing all $f$-vectors of cubical $d$-polytopes? We construct cubical polytopes showing that this cone, expressed in the cubical $g$-vector coordinates, contains the nonnegative $g$-orthant, thus verifying one direction of the Cubical Generalized Lower Bound Conjecture of Babson, Billera and Chan. Our polytopes also show that a natural cubical analogue of the simplicial Generalized Lower Bound Theorem does not hold.;math.CO
1801.00167;A Concentration Inequality for Random Polytopes, Dirichlet-Voronoi Tiling Numbers and the Geometric Balls and Bins Problem;Our main contribution is a concentration inequality for the symmetric volume difference of a $ C^2 $ convex body with positive Gaussian curvature and a circumscribed random polytope with a restricted number of facets, for any probability measure on the boundary with a positive density function. We also show that the Dirichlet-Voronoi tiling numbers satisfy $ \text{div}_{n-1} = (2\pi e)^{-1}(n+\ln n) + O(1)$, which improves a classical result of Zador by a factor of $o(n)$. In addition, we provide a remarkable open problem which is the natural geometric generalization of the famous and fundamental "balls and bins" problem from probability. This problem is tightly connected to the optimality of random polytopes in high dimensions.;math.MG
1801.00170;Robust affine control of linear stochastic systems;In this work we provide a computationally tractable procedure for designing affine control policies, applied to constrained, discrete-time, partially observable, linear systems subject to set bounded disturbances, stochastic noise and potentially Markovian switching over a finite horizon. <br />We investigate the situation when performance specifications are expressed via averaged quadratic inequalities on the random state-control trajectory. Our methodology also applies to steering the density of the state-control trajectory under set bounded uncertainty. Our developments are based on expanding the notion of affine policies that are functions of the so-called "purified outputs", to the class of Markov jump linear systems. This re-parametrization of the set of policies, induces a bi-affine structure in the state and control variables that can further be exploited via robust optimization techniques, with the approximate inhomogeneous $S$-lemma being the cornerstone. Tractability is understood in the sense that for each type of performance specification considered, an explicit convex program for selecting the parameters specifying the control policy is provided. <br />Our contributions to the existing literature on the subject of robust constrained control lies in the fact that we are addressing a wider class of systems than the ones already studied, by including Markovian switching, and the consideration of quadratic inequalities rather than just linear ones. Our work expands on the previous investigations on finite horizon covariance control by addressing the robustness issue and the possibility that the full state may not be available, therefore enabling the steering of the state-control trajectory density in the presence of disturbances under partial observation.;math.OC
1801.00172;The Allocation of a Variable Series Reactor Considering AC Constraints and Contingencies;The Variable Series Reactors (VSRs) can efficiently control the power flow through the adjustment of the line reactance. When they are appropriately allocated in the power network, the transmission congestion and generation cost can be reduced. This paper proposes a planning model to optimally allocate VSRs considering AC constraints and multi-scenarios including base case and contingencies. The planning model is originally a non-convex large scale mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is generally intractable. The proposed Benders approach decomposes the MINLP model into a mixed integer linear program (MILP) master problem and a number of nonlinear subproblems. Numerical case studies based on IEEE 118-bus demonstrate the high performance of the proposed approach.;math.OC
1801.00177;Conservation of energy for the Euler-Korteweg equations;In this article we study the principle of energy conservation for the Euler-Korteweg system. We formulate an Onsager-type sufficient regularity condition for weak solutions of the Euler-Korteweg system to conserve the total energy. The result applies to the system of Quantum Hydrodynamics.;math.AP
1801.00179;n-Arc Connected Graphs;Given a graph G, of arbitrary size and unbounded vertex degree, denote by |G| the one-complex associated with $G$. The topological space |G| is n-arc connected (n-ac) if every set of no more than n points of |G| are contained in an arc (a homeomorphic copy of the closed unit interval). <br />For any graph G, we show the following are equivalent: (i) |G| in 7-ac, (ii) |G| is n-ac for all n, and (iii) G is a subdivision of one of nine graphs. A graph G has |G| 6-ac if and only if either G is one of the nine 7-ac graphs, or, after suppressing all degree-2-vertices, the graph G is 3-regular, 3-connected, and removing any 6 edges does not disconnect G into 4 or more components. <br />Similar combinatorial characterizations of graphs G such that |G| is n-ac for n=3, 4 and 5 are given. Together these results yield a complete classification of n-ac graphs, for all n.;math.CO
1801.00186;Norm Estimates for $k$-Plane Transforms and Geometric Inequalities;The article is devoted to remarkable interrelation between the norm estimates for $k$-plane transforms in weighted and unweighted $L^p$ spaces and geometric integral inequalities for cross-sections of measurable sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We also consider more general $j$-plane to $k$-plane transforms on affine Grassmannians and their compact modifications. The article contains a series of new integral-geometric inequalities with sharp constants, explicit equalities, conjectures, and open problems.;math.MG
1801.00188;Coefficients of Gaussian Polynomials Modulo $N$;The $q$-analogue of the binomial coefficient, known as a $q$-binomial coefficient, is typically denoted $\left[{n \atop k}\right]_q$. These polynomials are important combinatorial objects, often appearing in generating functions related to permutations and in representation theory. Stanley conjectured that the function $f_{k,R}(n) = \#\left\{i : [q^{i}] \left[{n \atop k}\right]_q \equiv R \pmod{N}\right\}$ is quasipolynomial for $N=2$. We generalize, showing that this is in fact true for any integer $N\in \mathbb{N}$ and determine a quasi-period $\pi'_N(k)$ derived from the minimal period $\pi_N(k)$ of partitions with at most $k$ parts modulo $N$.;math.CO
1801.00191;Categorical diagonalization of full twists;We conjecture that the complex of Soergel bimodules associated with the full twist braid is categorically diagonalizable, for any finite Coxeter group. This utilizes the theory of categorical diagonalization introduced earlier by the authors. We prove our conjecture in type $A$, and as a result we obtain a categorification of the Young idempotents.;math.RT
1801.00193;Free resolutions of orbit closures of Dynkin quivers;We use the Kempf-Lascoux-Weyman geometric technique in order to determine the minimal free resolutions of some orbit closures of quivers. As a consequence, we obtain that for Dynkin quivers orbit closures of 1-step representations are normal with rational singularities. For Dynkin quivers of type $A$, we describe explicit minimal generators of the defining ideals of orbit closures of 1-step representations. Using this, we provide an algorithm for type $A$ quivers for describing an efficient set of generators of the defining ideal of the orbit closure of any representation.;math.AG
1801.00195;Mittag-Leffler function and fractional differential equations;We adopt a procedure of operational-umbral type to solve the $(1+1)$-dimensional fractional Fokker-Planck equation in which time fractional derivative of order $\alpha$ ($0 &lt, \alpha &lt, 1$) is in the Riemann-Liouville sense. The technique we propose merges well documented operational methods to solve ordinary FP equation and a redefinition of the time by means of an umbral operator. We show that the proposed method allows significant progress including the handling of operator ordering.;math-ph
1801.00197;A Priori Error Estimates for Finite Element Approximations to Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami Operator;Elliptic partial differential equations on surfaces play an essential role in geometry, relativity theory, phase transitions, materials science, image processing, and other applications. They are typically governed by the Laplace-Beltrami operator. We present and analyze approximations by Surface Finite Element Methods (SFEM) of the Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalue problem. As for SFEM for source problems, spectral approximation is challenged by two sources of errors: the geometric consistency error due to the approximation of the surface and the Galerkin error corresponding to finite element resolution of eigenfunctions. We show that these two error sources interact for eigenfunction approximations as for the source problem. The situation is different for eigenvalues, where a novel situation occurs for the geometric consistency error: The degree of the geometric error depends on the choice of interpolation points used to construct the approximate surface. Thus the geometric consistency term can sometimes be made to converge faster than in the eigenfunction case through a judicious choice of interpolation points.;math.NA
1801.00199;Existence and concentration results for some fractional Schr&#xf6,dinger equations in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ with magnetic fields;We consider some nonlinear fractional Schr\"odinger equations with magnetic field and involving continuous nonlinearities having subcritical, critical or supercritical growth. Under a local condition on the potential, we use minimax methods to investigate the existence and concentration of nontrivial weak solutions.;math.AP
1801.00200;Decomposition matrices for the generic Hecke algebras on 3 strands in characteristic 0;We classify all the decomposition matrices of the generic Hecke algebras on 3 strands in characteristic 0. These are the generic Hecke algebras associated to the exceptional complex reflection groups $G_4$, $G_8$ and $G_{16}$. We prove that for every choice of the parameters that define these algebras, all ordinary representations are obtained as modular reductions of irreducible representations.;math.RT
1801.00204;Filled Julia set of some class of H&#xe9,non-like map;In this work we consider a class of endomorphisms of $\mathbb{R}^2$ defined by $f(x,y)=(xy+c,x)$, where $c\in\mathbb{R}$ is a real number and we prove that when $-1&lt,c&lt,0$, the forward filled Julia set of $f$ is the union of stable manifolds of fixed and $3-$periodic points of $f$. We also prove that the backward filled Julia set of $f$ is the union of unstable manifolds of the saddle fixed and $3-$periodic points of $f$.;math.DS
1801.00207;The $Z$-Dirac and massive Laplacian operators in the $Z$-invariant Ising model;Consider an elliptic parameter $k$, we introduce a family of $Z^u$-Dirac operators $(\mathsf{K}(u))_{u\in\Re(\mathbb{T}(k))}$, relate them to the $Z$-massive Laplacian of [BdTR17b], and extend to the full $Z$-invariant case the results of Kenyon [Ken02] on discrete holomorphic and harmonic functions, which correspond to the case $k=0$. We prove, in a direct statistical mechanics way, how and why the $Z^u$-Dirac and $Z$-massive Laplacian operators appear in the $Z$-invariant Ising model, considering the case of infinite and finite isoradial graphs. More precisely, consider the dimer model on the Fisher graph ${\mathsf{G}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathrm{F}}}$ arising from a $Z$-invariant Ising model. We express coefficients of the inverse Fisher Kasteleyn operator as a function of the inverse $Z^u$-Dirac operator and also as a function of the $Z$-massive Green function, in particular this proves a (massive) random walk representation of important observables of the Ising model. We prove that the squared partition function of the Ising model is equal, up to a constant, to the determinant of the $Z$-massive Laplacian operator with specific boundary conditions, the latter being the partition function of rooted spanning forests. To show these results, we relate the inverse Fisher Kasteleyn operator and that of the dimer model on the bipartite graph ${\mathsf{G}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathrm{Q}}}$ arising from the XOR-Ising model, and we prove matrix identities between the Kasteleyn matrix of ${\mathsf{G}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathrm{Q}}}$ and the $Z^u$-Dirac operator, that allow to reach inverse matrices as well as determinants.;math-ph
1801.00208;KP theory, plabic networks in the disk and rational degenerations of M--curves;We complete the program of Ref. [3,5] of connecting totally non-negative Grassmannians to the reality problem in KP finite-gap theory via the assignment of real regular divisors on rational degenerations of M-curves for the class of real regular multi-line soliton solutions of KP II equation whose asymptotic behavior has been combinatorially characterized by Chakravarthy, Kodama and Williams. We use the plabic networks in the disk introduced by Postnikov to parametrize positroid cells in totally nonnegative Grassmannians. The boundary of the disk corresponds to the rational curve associated to the soliton data in the direct spectral problem, and the bicolored graph is the dual of a reducible curve G which is the rational degeneration of a regular M-curve whose genus g equals the number of faces of the network diminished by one. We assign systems of edge vectors to the planar bicolored networks. The system of relations satisfied by them has maximal rank and may be reformulated in the form of edge signatures.. We prove that the components of the edge vectors are rational in the edge weights with subtraction free denominators and provide their explicit expressions in terms of conservative and edge flows. The edge vectors rule the value of the KP wave function at the double points of G, whereas the signatures at the vertices rule the position of the divisor in the ovals. We prove that the divisor satisfies the conditions of Dubrovin-Natanzon for real finite-gap solutions: there is exactly one divisor point in each oval except for the one containing the essential singularity of the wave function. The divisor may be explicitly computed using the linear relations at the vertices of the network. We explain the role of moves and reductions in the transformation of both the curve and the divisor for given soliton data, and apply our construction to some examples.;math-ph
1801.00210;A study of elliptic gamma function and allies;We study analytic and arithmetic properties of the elliptic gamma function $$ \prod_{m,n=0}^\infty\frac{1-x^{-1}q^{m+1}p^{n+1}}{1-xq^mp^n}, \qquad |q|,|p|&lt,1, $$ in the regime $p=q$, in particular, its connection with the elliptic dilogarithm and a formula of S. Bloch. We further extend the results to more general products by linking them to non-holomorphic Eistenstein series and, via some formulae of D. Zagier, to elliptic polylogarithms.;math.NT
1801.00212;Benford&#x27,s Law Beyond Independence: Tracking Benford Behavior in Copula Models;Benford's law describes a common phenomenon among many naturally occurring data sets and distributions in which the leading digits of the data are distributed with the probability of a first digit of $d$ base $B$ being $\log_{B}{\frac{d+1}{d}}$. As it often successfully detects fraud in medical trials, voting, science and finance, significant effort has been made to understand when and how distributions exhibit Benford behavior. Most of the previous work has been restricted to cases of independent variables, and little is known about situations involving dependence. We use copulas to investigate the Benford behavior of the product of $n$ dependent random variables. We develop a method for approximating the Benford behavior of a product of $n$ dependent random variables modeled by a copula distribution $C$ and quantify and bound a copula distribution's distance from Benford behavior. We then investigate the Benford behavior of various copulas under varying dependence parameters and number of marginals. Our investigations show that the convergence to Benford behavior seen with independent random variables as the number of variables in the product increases is not necessarily preserved when the variables are dependent and modeled by a copula. Furthermore, there is strong indication that the preservation of Benford behavior of the product of dependent random variables may be linked more to the structure of the copula than to the Benford behavior of the marginal distributions.;math.PR
1801.00214;Partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms homotopic to the identity on 3-manifolds;We announce some results towards the classification of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms on 3-manifolds, and outline the proofs in the case when the diffeomorphism is dynamically coherent. Detailed proofs are long and technical and will appear later.;math.DS
1801.00219;Liftings of pseudo-reflection groups of toric quotients of Krull schemes;Let $G$ be an affine algebraic group with a reductive identity component $G^{0}$ acting regularly on an affine Krull scheme $X = {Spec} (R)$ over an algebraically closed field. Let $T$ be an algebraic subtorus of $G$ and suppose that ${Q}(R)^{T}= {Q}(R^{T})$ of quotient fields. We will show: If $G$ is the centralizer of $T$ in $G$, then the pseudo-reflections of the action of $G$ on $R^{T}$ can be lifted to those on $R$.;math.GR
1801.00222;Limitation of SDMA in Ultra-Dense Small Cell Networks;Benefitting from multi-user gain brought by multi-antenna techniques, space division multiple access (SDMA) is capable of significantly enhancing spatial throughput (ST) in wireless networks. Nevertheless, we show in this letter that, even when SDMA is applied, ST would diminish to be zero in ultra-dense networks (UDN), where small cell base stations (BSs) are fully densified. More importantly, we compare the performance of SDMA, single-user beamforming (SU-BF) (one user is served in each cell) and full SDMA (the number of served users equals the number of equipped antennas). Surprisingly, it is shown that SU-BF achieves the highest ST and critical density, beyond which ST starts to degrade, in UDN. The results in this work could shed light on the fundamental limitation of SDMA in UDN.;cs.IT

1801.00226;Quantifier elimination on some pseudo-algebraically closed valued fields;Adjoining to the language of rings the function symbols for splitting coefficients, the function symbols for relative $p$-coordinate functions, and the division predicate for a valuation, some theories of pseudo-algebraically closed non-trivially valued fields admit quantifier elimination. It is also shown that in the same language the theory of pseudo-algebraically closed non-trivially valued fields of a given exponent of imperfection does not admit quantifier elimination, due to Galois theoretic obstructions.;math.LO
1801.00229;On counting certain abelian varieties over finite fields;This paper contains two parts toward studying abelian varieties from the classification point of view. In a series of papers, the current authors and T.-C. Yang obtain explicit formulas for the numbers of superspecial abelian surfaces over finite fields. In this paper, we give an explicit formula for the size of the isogeny class of simple abelian surfaces with real Weil number $\sqrt{q}$. This establishes a key step that one may extend our previous explicit calculations of superspecial abelian surfaces to those of supersingular abelian surfaces.The second part is to introduce the notion of genera and ideal complexes of abelian varieties with additional structures in a general setting. The purpose is to generalize the results of Yu on abelian varieties with additional structures to similitude classes, which establishes more results on the connection between geometrically defined and arithmetically defined masses for further investigation.;math.NT
1801.00230;Idempotents in Tangle Categories Split;In this paper we use 3-manifold techniques to illuminate the structure of the category of tangles.

1801.00231;Mean-Square Approximation of Iterated Ito and Stratonovich Stochastic Integrals of Multiplicities 1 to 6 from the Taylor-Ito and Taylor-Stratonovich Expansions Using Legendre Polynomials;The article is devoted to the practical material on expansions and mean-square approximations of specific iterated Ito and Stratonovich stochastic integrals of multiplicities 1 to 6 with respect to components of the multidimensional Wiener process on the base of the method of generalized multiple Fourier series. More precisely, we used the multiple Fourier--Legendre series converging in the sense of norm in the space $L_2([t, T]^k)$ $(k=1,\ldots,6)$ for approximation of iterated Ito and Stratonovich stochastic integrals. The considered iterated Ito and Stratonovich stochastic integrals are part of the stochastic Taylor expansions (Taylor-Ito and Taylor-Stratonovich expansions). Therefore, the results of the article can be useful for construction of the high-order strong numerical methods for Ito stochastic differential equations. Expansions of iterated Ito and Stratonovich stochastic integrals of multiplicities 1 to 6 using Legendre polynomials are derived. The convergence with probability 1 of the mentioned method of generalized multiple Fourier series is proved for iterated Ito stochastic integrals of multiplicities $k$ $(k\in\mathbb{N})$ for the cases of multiple Fourier-Legendre series and multiple trigonometric Fourier series.;math.PR
1801.00232;Stabilization of the weakly coupled wave-plate system with one internal damping;This paper is addressed to a stabilization problem of a system coupled by a wave and a Euler-Bernoulli plate equation. Only one equation is supposed to be damped. Under some assumption about the damping and the coupling terms, it is shown that sufficiently smooth solutions of the system decay logarithmically at infinity without any geometric conditions on the effective damping domain. The proofs of these decay results rely on the interpolation inequalities for the coupled elliptic-parabolic systems and make use of the estimate of the resolvent operator for the coupled system. The main tools to derive the desired interpolation inequalities are global Carleman estimates.;math.OC
1801.00234;Unstable modes in projection-based reduced-order models: How many can there be, and what do they tell you?;Projection methods provide an appealing way to construct reduced-order models of large-scale linear dynamical systems: they are intuitively motivated and fairly easy to compute. Unfortunately, the resulting reduced models need not inherit the stability of the original system. How many unstable modes can these reduced models have? This note investigates this question, using theory originally motivated by iterative methods for linear algebraic systems and eigenvalue problems, and illustrating the theory with a number of small examples. From these results follow rigorous upper bounds on the number of unstable modes in reduced models generated via orthogonal projection, for both continuous- and discrete-time systems. Can anything be learned from the unstable modes in reduced-order models? Several examples illustrate how such instability can helpfully signal transient growth in the original system.;math.NA
1801.00236;On closed subalgebras of CB(X);For a completely regular space $X$ and a non-vanishing self-adjoint closed subalgebra $H$ of $C_B(X)$ which separates points from closed sets in $X$ we construct the Gelfand spectrum $\mathfrak{sp}(H)$ of $H$ as an open subspace of the compactification of $X$ generated by $H$. The simple construction of $\mathfrak{sp}(H)$ enables easier examination of its properties. We illustrate this by an example showing that the space $\mathfrak{sp}(H)$ is separable metrizable if and only if $H$ is countably generated.;math.FA
1801.00238;Cardinal characteristics of the continuum and partitions;We prove combinatorial theorems concerning the stick principle and cardinal characteristics.;math.LO
1801.00239;The first omitting cardinal for Magidority;We prove that $\alpha_M(\lambda)$ can be successor of a supercompact cardinal, when $\lambda$ is a Magidor cardinal. From this result we obtain the consistency of $\alpha_M(\lambda)$ being a successor of a singular cardinal with uncountable cofinality.;math.LO
1801.00240;Uniform modular lattices and affine buildings;In this paper, we present a simple lattice-theoretic characterization for affine buildings of type A. We introduce a class of modular lattices, called uniform modular lattices, and show that uniform modular lattices and affine buildings of type A constitute the same object. This is an affine counterpart of the well-known equivalence between projective geometries ($\simeq$ complemented modular lattices) and spherical buildings of type A.;math.CO
1801.00241;Isometric Embedding and Darboux Integrability;Given a smooth 2-dimensional Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifold $(M, \boldsymbol{g})$ and an ambient 3-dimensional Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifold $(N, \boldsymbol{h})$, one can ask under what circumstances does the exterior differential system $\mathcal{I}$ for the isometric embedding $M\hookrightarrow N$ have particularly nice solvability properties. In this paper we give a classification of all $2$-metrics $\boldsymbol{g}$ whose local isometric embedding system into flat Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian 3-manifolds $(N, \boldsymbol{h})$ is Darboux integrable. As an illustration of the motivation behind the classification, we examine in detail one of the classified metrics, $\boldsymbol{g}_0$, showing how to use its Darboux integrability in order to construct all its embeddings in finite terms of arbitrary functions. Additionally, the geometric Cauchy problem for the embedding of $\boldsymbol{g}_0$ is shown to be reducible to a system of two first-order ODEs for two unknown functions---or equivalently, to a single second-order scalar ODE. For a large class of initial data, this reduction permits explicit solvability of the geometric Cauchy problem for $\boldsymbol{g}_0$ up to quadrature. The results described for $\boldsymbol{g}_0$ also hold for any classified metric whose embedding system is hyperbolic.;math.DG
1801.00242;Estimating symplectic capacities from lengths of closed curves on the unit spheres;We improve the estimates for the Ekeland--Hofer--Zehnder capacity of convex bodies by Gluskin and Ostrover. In the course of our argument we show that a closed characteristic of minimal action on the boundary of a centrally symmetric convex body in $\mathbb R^{2n}$ must itself be centrally symmetric, with generalizations to some other types of symmetry.;math.MG
1801.00245;On R-matrix valued Lax pairs for Calogero-Moser models;The article is devoted to the study of $R$-matrix-valued Lax pairs for $N$-body (elliptic) Calogero-Moser models. Their matrix elements are given by quantum ${\rm GL}_{\tilde N}$ $R$-matrices of Baxter-Belavin type. For $\tilde N=1$ the widely known Krichever's Lax pair with spectral parameter is reproduced. First, we construct the $R$-matrix-valued Lax pairs for Calogero-Moser models associated with classical root systems. For this purpose we study generalizations of the D'Hoker-Phong Lax pairs. It appeared that in the $R$-matrix-valued case the Lax pairs exist in special cases only. The number of quantum spaces (on which $R$-matrices act) and their dimension depend on the values of coupling constants. Some of the obtained classical Lax pairs admit straightforward extension to the quantum case. In the end we describe a relationship of the $R$-matrix-valued Lax pairs to Hitchin systems defined on ${\rm SL}_{N\tilde N}$ bundles with nontrivial characteristic classes over elliptic curve. We show that the classical analogue of the anisotropic spin exchange operator entering the $R$-matrix-valued Lax equations is reproduced in these models.;math-ph
1801.00246;A GPU Accelerated Discontinuous Galerkin Incompressible Flow Solver;We present a GPU-accelerated version of a high-order discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The equations are discretized in time using a semi-implicit scheme with explicit treatment of the nonlinear term and implicit treatment of the split Stokes operators. The pressure system is solved with a conjugate gradient method together with a fully GPU-accelerated multigrid preconditioner which is designed to minimize memory requirements and to increase overall performance. A semi-Lagrangian subcycling advection algorithm is used to shift the computational load per timestep away from the pressure Poisson solve by allowing larger timestep sizes in exchange for an increased number of advection steps. Numerical results confirm we achieve the design order accuracy in time and space. We optimize the performance of the most time-consuming kernels by tuning the fine-grain parallelism, memory utilization, and maximizing bandwidth. To assess overall performance we present an empirically calibrated roofline performance model for a target GPU to explain the achieved efficiency. We demonstrate that, in the most cases, the kernels used in the solver are close to their empirically predicted roofline performance.;math.NA
1801.00247;Spin Structures and Branch Divisors on $p$-gonal Riemann surfaces;We study spin structures on Riemann and Klein surfaces in terms of divisors. In particular, we take a closer look at spin structures on hyperelliptic and $p$-gonal surfaces defined by divisors supported on their branch points. Moreover, we study invariant spin divisors under automorphisms and anti-holomorphic involutions of Riemann surfaces.;math.CV
1801.00249;Tiling enumeration of doubly-intruded halved hexagons;Inspired by Propp's intruded Aztec diamond regions, we consider halved hexagons in which two aligned arrays of triangular holes have been removed from their boundaries. Unlike the intruded Aztec diamonds (whose numbers of domino tilings contain some large prime factors in their factorizations), the numbers of lozenge tilings of our doubly-intruded halved hexagons are given by simple product formulas in which all factors are linear in the parameters. In this paper, we present an extensive list of exact tiling enumerations of sixteen different types of doubly-intruded halved hexagons. We also prove that the lozenge tilings of a symmetric hexagon with three arrays of triangles removed are always enumerated by a closed-form product formula. Our results generalize several previous works, including Proctor's enumeration of the transposed-complementary plane partitions, related work of Ciucu, and recent generalizations of Rohatgi and of the author.;math.CO
1801.00258;Distributed Observers Design for Leader-Following Control of Multi-Agent Networks (Extended Version);This paper is concerned with a leader-follower problem for a multi-agent system with a switching interconnection topology. Distributed observers are designed for the second-order follower-agents, under the common assumption that the velocity of the active leader cannot be measured in real time. Some dynamic neighbor-based rules, consisting of distributed controllers and observers for the autonomous agents, are developed to keep updating the information of the leader. With the help of an explicitly constructed common Lyapunov function (CLF), it is proved that each agent can follow the active leader. Moreover, the tracking error is estimated even in a noisy environment. Finally, a numerical example is given for illustration.;math.OC
1801.00261;First-Order Primal-Dual Method for Nonlinear Convex Cone Programming;Nonlinear Convex Cone Programming (NCCP) problems are important and have many practical applications. In this paper, we introduces a flexible first-order primal-dual algorithm called the Variant Auxiliary Problem Principle (VAPP) for solving NCCP problems when the objective function and constraints are smooth and may be nonsmooth. Each iteration of VAPP generates a nonlinear approximation to the primal problem of an augmented Lagrangian method. The approximation incorporates both linearization and a variable distance-like function, and then the iterations of VAPP provide one decomposition property for NCCP. Motivated by recent applications in big data analysis, there has been an explosive growth in interest in the convergence rate analysis of parallel computing algorithms for large scale optimization problem. This paper proposes an iteration-based error bound and linear convergence of VAPP. Some verifiable sufficient conditions of this error bound are also discussed. For the general convex case (without error bound), we establish $O(1/t)$ convergence rate for primal suboptimality, feasibility and dual suboptimality. By adaptively setting in parameters at different iterations, we show an $O(1/t^2)$ rate for the strongly convex case. We further present Forward-Backward Splitting (FBS) formulation of VAPP method and establish the connection between VAPP and other primal-dual splitting methods. Finally, we discuss some issues in the implementation of VAPP.;math.OC
1801.00265;Semisimple characters for inner forms II: Quaternionic inner forms of classical groups;In this article we consider a quaternionic inner form $G$ of a $p$-adic classical group defined over a non-archimedian local field of odd residue characteristic. We construct all full self-dual semisimple characters for $G$ and we classify their intertwining classes using endo-parameters. Further we prove an intertwining and conjugacy theorem for self-dual semisimple characters. We give the formulas for the set of intertwiners between self-dual semisimple characters. We count all $G$-intertwining classes of self-dual semisimple characters which lift to the same $\tilde{G}$-intertwining class of a semisimple character for the ambient general linear group $\tilde{G}$ for $G$.;math.RT
1801.00267;On hereditarily just infinite profinite groups with complete Hausdorff dimension spectrum;We prove that the inverse limit of certain iterated wreath products in product action have complete Hausdorff dimension spectrum with respect to their unique maximal filtration of open normal subgroups. Moreover we can produce explicitly subgroups with a specified Hausdorff dimension.;math.GR
1801.00268;On the Quantum-Mechanics of a Single Photon;It is shown that a Dirac(-type) equation for a rank-two bi-spinor field on Minkowski (configuration) spacetime furnishes a Lorentz-covariant quantum-mechanical wave equation in position-space representation for a single free photon. This equation does not encounter any of the roadblocks that have obstructed previous attempts (by various authors) to formulate a {quantum-mechanical} photon wave equation. In particular, it implies that the photon wave function yields conserved non-negative Born-rule-type quantum probabilities, and that its probability current density four-vector transforms properly under Lorentz transformations. Moreover, the eigenvalues of the pertinent photon Dirac Hamiltonian and the vector eigenvalues of the photon momentum operator yield the familiar Einstein relations $E=\hbar\omega$ and ${\bf p}=\hbar{\bf k}$, respectively. Furthermore, these spin-1 wave modes are automatically transversal without the need of an additional constraint on the initial data. Some comments on other proposals to set up a photon wave equation are supplied as well.;math-ph
1801.00270;A Hermite WENO reconstruction for fourth order temporal accurate schemes based on the GRP solver for hyperbolic conservation laws;This paper develops a new fifth order accurate Hermite WENO (HWENO) reconstruction method for hyperbolic conservation schemes in the framework of the two-stage fourth order accurate temporal discretization in [{\em J. Li and Z. Du, A two-stage fourth order time-accurate discretization {L}ax--{W}endroff type flow solvers, {I}. {H}yperbolic conservation laws, SIAM, J. Sci. Comput., 38 (2016), pp.~A3046--A3069}]. Instead of computing the first moment of the solution additionally in the conventional HWENO or DG approach, we can directly take the {\em interface values}, which are already available in the numerical flux construction using the generalized Riemann problem (GRP) solver, to approximate the first moment. The resulting scheme is fourth order temporal accurate by only invoking the HWENO reconstruction twice so that it becomes more compact. Numerical experiments show that such compactness makes significant impact on the resolution of nonlinear waves.;math.NA
1801.00279;Partial quasi likelihood analysis;The quasi likelihood analysis is generalized to the partial quasi likelihood analysis. Limit theorems for the quasi likelihood estimators, especially the quasi Bayesian estimator, are derived in the situation where existence of a slow mixing component prohibits the Rosenthal type inequality from applying to the derivation of the polynomial type large deviation inequality for the statistical random field. We give two illustrative examples.;math.ST
1801.00287;Cubic threefolds and hyperk&#xe4,hler manifolds uniformized by the 10-dimensional complex ball;We first prove an isomorphism between the moduli space of smooth cubic threefolds and the moduli space of hyperkaehler fourfolds of K3^{[2]}-type with a non-symplectic automorphism of order three, whose invariant lattice has rank one and is generated by a class of square 6, both these spaces are uniformized by the same 10-dimensional arithmetic complex ball quotient. We then study the degeneration of the automorphism along the loci of nodal or chordal degenerations of the cubic threefold, showing the birationality of these loci with some moduli spaces of hyperkaehler fourfolds of K3^{[2]}-type with non-symplectic automorphism of order three belonging to different families. Finally, we construct a cyclic Pfaffian cubic fourfold to give an explicit construction of a non-natural automorphism of order three on the Hilbert square of a K3 surface.;math.AG
1801.00288;Boolean Dimension, Components and Blocks;We investigate the behavior of Boolean dimension with respect to components and blocks. To put our results in context, we note that for Dushnik-Miller dimension, we have that if $\dim(C)\le d$ for every component $C$ of a poset $P$, then $\dim(P)\le \max\{2,d\}$, also if $\dim(B)\le d$ for every block $B$ of a poset $P$, then $\dim(P)\le d+2$. By way of constrast, local dimension is well behaved with respect to components, but not for blocks: if $\text{ldim}(C)\le d$ for every component $C$ of a poset $P$, then $\text{ldim}(P)\le d+2$, however, for every $d\ge 4$, there exists a poset $P$ with $\text{ldim}(P)=d$ and $\dim(B)\le 3$ for every block $B$ of $P$. In this paper we show that Boolean dimension behaves like Dushnik-Miller dimension with respect to both components and blocks: if $\text{bdim}(C)\le d$ for every component $C$ of $P$, then $\text{bdim}(P)\le 2+d+4\cdot2^d$, also if $\text{bdim}(B)\le d$ for every block of $P$, then $\text{bdim}(P)\le 19+d+18\cdot 2^d$.;math.CO
1801.00291;A generalized Bartholdi zeta function formula for simple graphs with bounded degree;We introduce a generalized Bartholdi zeta function for simple graphs with bounded degree. This zeta function is a generalization of both the Bartholdi zeta function which was introduced by L.~Bartholdi and the Ihara zeta function which was introduced by G.~Chinta, J.~Jorgenson and A.~Karlsson. Furthermore, we establish a Bartholdi type formula of this Bartholdi zeta function for simple graphs with bounded degree. Moreover, for regular graphs, we give a new expression of the heat kernel which is regarded as a one-parameter deformation of the expression obtained by G.~Chinta, J.~Jorgenson and A.~Karlsson. By applying this formula, we give an alternative proof of the Bartholdi zeta function formula for regular graphs.;math.CO
1801.00295;Moutard transform for the conductivity equation;We construct Darboux-Moutard type transforms for the two-dimensional conductivity equation. This result continues our recent studies of Darboux-Moutard type transforms for generalized analytic functions. In addition, at least, some of the Darboux-Moutard type transforms of the present work admit direct extension to the conductivity equation in multidimensions. Relations to the Schr\"odinger equation at zero energy are also shown.;math-ph
1801.00296;Graph invariants and Betti numbers of real toric manifolds;For a graph $G$, a graph cubeahedron $\square_G$ and a graph associahedron $\triangle_G$ are simple convex polytopes which admit (real) toric manifolds. In this paper, we introduce a graph invariant, called the $b$-number, and we show that the $b$-numbers compute the Betti numbers of the real toric manifold $X^\mathbb{R}(\square_G)$ corresponding to a graph cubeahedron. The $b$-number is a counterpart of the notion of $a$-number, introduced by S. Choi and the second named author, which computes the Betti numbers of the real toric manifold $X^\mathbb{R}(\triangle_G)$ corresponding to a graph associahedron. We also study various relationships between $a$-numbers and $b$-numbers from a toric topological view. Interestingly, for a forest $G$ and its line graph $L(G)$, the real toric manifolds $X^\mathbb{R}(\triangle_G)$ and $X^\mathbb{R}(\square_{L(G)})$ have the same Betti numbers.;math.CO
1801.00302;Pure-minimal chain complexes;We introduce a notion of pure-minimality for chain complexes of modules and show that it coincides with (homotopic) minimality in standard settings, while being a more useful notion for complexes of flat modules. As applications, we characterize von Neumann regular rings and left perfect rings.;math.AC
1801.00303;An elementary proof of an isoperimetric inequality for paths with finite $p$-variation;In this article we will prove that if the continuous closed curve $\gamma : [0, 1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ has finite $p$-variation with $p &lt, 2$, then $(\iint\limits_{\mathbb{R}^2}|\eta(\gamma, (x, y))|^q \,dx \,dy)^{1/q} \le (\frac{1}{2})^\frac{1}{q}(\zeta(\frac{2}{pq})-1)(||\gamma||_{p, [0, 1]})^{\frac{2}{q}} $ for all $q \in [1, \frac{2}{p})$, where $\eta(\gamma, (x, y))$ is the winding number of $\gamma$ at $(x, y), \zeta$ is the Reimann zeta function, and $||\gamma||_{p, [0, 1]}$ is the $p$-variation of $\gamma$ on the interval $[0, 1]$. <br />Our main contribution is that we have explicitly given a bound by known constants, and we have found this by an elementary proof. We are going to be using a method introduced by L.C. Young in 1936.;math.CA
1801.00310;On Binary Distributed Hypothesis Testing;We consider the problem of distributed binary hypothesis testing of two sequences that are generated by an i.i.d. doubly-binary symmetric source. Each sequence is observed by a different terminal. The two hypotheses correspond to different levels of correlation between the two source components, i.e., the crossover probability between the two. The terminals communicate with a decision function via rate-limited noiseless links. We analyze the tradeoff between the exponential decay of the two error probabilities associated with the hypothesis test and the communication rates. We first consider the side-information setting where one encoder is allowed to send the full sequence. For this setting, previous work exploits the fact that a decoding error of the source does not necessarily lead to an erroneous decision upon the hypothesis. We provide improved achievability results by carrying out a tighter analysis of the effect of binning error, the results are also more complete as they cover the full exponent tradeoff and all possible correlations. We then turn to the setting of symmetric rates for which we utilize Korner-Marton coding to generalize the results, with little degradation with respect to the performance with a one-sided constraint (side-information setting).;cs.IT
1801.00311;Igor Rostislavovich Shafarevich: in Memoriam;The prominent Russian mathematician Igor Rostislavovich Shafarevich passed away on February 19, 2017. In this article we supply his biography, discuss his many important contributions to number theory, algebra and algebraic geometry, and also discuss his political activity and some of his numerous publications on social issues.;math.HO
1801.00312;Irreducible representations of the group of unipotent matrices of order $4$ over integers;We study a coarse moduli space of irreducible representations of the group of unipotent matrices of order $\mathbb{4}$ over the ring of integers which have finite weight. All such representations are known to be monomial. To describe a coarse moduli space of such representations, we need to study pairs of subgroups and their characters, which induce non-isomorphic irreducible representations. We obtain a full classification of such pairs and, respectively, a coarse moduli space.;math.RT
1801.00314;Symmetric double bubbles in the Grushin plane;We address the double bubble problem for the anisotropic Grushin perimeter $P_\alpha$, $\alpha\geq 0$, and the Lebesgue measure in $\mathbb R^2$, in the case of two equal volumes. We assume that the contact interface between the bubbles lays on either the vertical or the horizontal axis. Since no regularity theory is available in this setting, in both cases we first prove existence of minimizers via the direct method by symmetrization arguments and then characterize them in terms of the given area by first variation techniques. Angles at which minimal boundaries intersect satisfy the standard 120-degree rule up to a suitable change of coordinates. While for $\alpha=0$ the Grushin perimeter reduces to the Euclidean one and both minimizers coincide with the symmetric double bubble found in [Foisy et al., Pacific J. Math. (1993)], for $\alpha=1$ vertical interface minimizers have Grushin perimeter strictly greater than horizontal interface minimizers. As the latter ones are obtained by translating and dilating the Grushin isoperimetric set found in [Monti Morbidelli, J. Geom. Anal. (2004)], we conjecture that they solve the double bubble problem with no assumptions on the contact interface.;math.OC
1801.00320;Immersed M&#xf6,bius bands in knot complements and representatives of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-homology classes;We study the 3-dimensional immersed crosscap number of a knot, which is a nonorientable analogue of the immersed Seifert genus. We study knots with immersed crosscap number 1, and show that a knot has immersed crosscap number 1 if and only if it is a nonntrivial $(2p,q)$-torus or $(2p,q)$-cable knot. We show that unlike in the orientable case the immersed crosscap number can differ from the embedded crosscap number by arbitrarily large amounts, and that it is neither bounded below nor above by the 4-dimensional crosscap number. We then use these constructions to find, for any $n\geq 2$, an oriented 3-manifold $Y_n$ and class $\alpha_n \in H_2(Y_n,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ such that $\alpha_n$ can be represented by an immersed $\mathbb{RP}^2$, but any embedded representative of $\alpha_n$ has a component $S$ with $\chi(S) \leq 1-n$.;math.GT
1801.00321;Modified trace is a symmetrised integral;A modified trace for a finite k-linear pivotal category is a family of linear forms on endomorphism spaces of projective objects which has cyclicity and so-called partial trace properties. We show that a non-degenerate modified trace defines a compatible with duality Calabi-Yau structure on the subcategory of projective objects. The modified trace provides a meaningful generalisation of the categorical trace to non-semisimple categories and allows to construct interesting topological invariants. We prove, that for any finite-dimensional unimodular pivotal Hopf algebra over a field k, a modified trace is determined by a symmetric linear form on the Hopf algebra constructed from an integral. More precisely, we prove that shifting with the pivotal element defines an isomorphism between the space of right integrals, which is known to be 1-dimensional, and the space of modified traces. This result allows us to compute modified traces for all simply laced restricted quantum groups at roots of unity.;math.QA
1801.00323;Geometric optics for Rayleigh wavetrains in d-dimensional nonlinear elasticity;A Rayleigh wave is a type of surface wave that propagates in the boundary of an elastic solid with traction (or Neumann) boundary conditions. Since the 1980s much work has been done on the problem of constructing a leading term in an \emph{approximate} solution to the rather complicated second-order quasilinear hyperbolic boundary value problem with fully nonlinear Neumann boundary conditions that governs the propagation of Rayleigh waves. The question has remained open whether or not this leading term approximate solution is really close in a precise sense to the exact solution of the governing equations. We prove a positive answer to this question for the case of Rayleigh wavetrains in any space dimension $d\geq 2$. The case of Rayleigh pulses in dimension $d=2$ has already been treated by Coulombel and Williams. For highly oscillatory Rayleigh wavetrains we are able to construct high-order approximate solutions consisting of the leading term plus an arbitrary number of correctors. Using those high-order solutions we then perform an error analysis which shows (among other things) that for small wavelengths the leading term is close to the exact solution in $L^\infty$ on a fixed time interval independent of the wavelength. The error analysis is carried out in a somewhat general setting and is applicable to other types of waves for which high order approximate solutions can be constructed.;math.AP
1801.00324;Blockers for Triangulations of a Convex Polygon and a Geometric Maker-Breaker Game;Let $G$ be a complete convex geometric graph whose vertex set $P$ forms a convex polygon $C$, and let $F$ be a family of subgraphs of $G$. A blocker for $F$ is a set of edges, of smallest possible size, that contains a common edge with every element of $F$. Previous works determined the blockers for various families $F$ of non-crossing subgraphs, including the families of all perfect matchings, all spanning trees, all Hamiltonian paths, etc. <br />In this paper we present a complete characterization of the family $B$ of blockers for the family $T$ of triangulations of $C$. In particular, we show that $|B|=F_{2n-8}$, where $F_k$ is the $k$'th element in the Fibonacci sequence and $n=|P|$. <br />We use our characterization to obtain a tight result on a geometric Maker-Breaker game in which the board is the set of diagonals of a convex $n$-gon $C$ and Maker seeks to occupy a triangulation of $C$. Namely, we show that in the $(1:1)$ triangulation game, Maker can ensure a win within $n-3$ moves, and that in the $(1:2)$ triangulation game, Breaker can ensure a win within $n-3$ moves. In particular, the threshold bias for the game is $2$.;math.CO
1801.00325;Sharp finiteness principles for Lipschitz selections;Let $(M,\rho)$ be a metric space and let $Y$ be a Banach space. Given a positive integer $m$, let $F$ be a set-valued mapping from $M$ into the family of all compact convex subsets of $Y$ of dimension at most $m$. In this paper we prove a finiteness principle for the existence of a Lipschitz selection of $F$ with the sharp value of the finiteness constant.;math.FA
1801.00327;Construction of the quasi-potential for linear SDEs using false quasi-potentials and a geometric recursion;The quasi-potential is a key concept of the Large Deviation Theory for Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). Once the quasi-potential with respect to an attractor of the corresponding deterministic system is found, one can readily obtain maximum likelihood exit paths and estimate the exit rate from the basin of attraction and the invariant probability density near the attractor. The quasi-potential for a linear SDE with asymptotically stable equilibrium at the origin is a quadratic form whose matrix was found by Z. Chen and M. Freidlin (2005). Their formula involves an integral of certain matrix exponentials and is inconvenient for numerical evaluation. In this work, I propose a different approach for constructing the quasi-potential matrix for linear SDEs based on a certain easy-to-obtain hierarchy of orthogonal decompositions inspired by those used by M. Tao (2018). A number of properties of these decompositions, named false quasi-potential decompositions, is established. A geometric recursive algorithm implementing this approach is presented. It involves only numerically stable sub-algorithms such as the computation of Schur decompositions and solving systems of linear equations or quadratic least squares problems. This work is motivated by the need to initialize the quasi-potential solvers near asymptotically stable equilibria. An accurate way to do it is to linearize the SDE near the equilibrium and set the values of the quasi-potential at the neighboring mesh points to the exact quasi-potential of the linearized system.;math.PR
1801.00328;Reconstruction of the Path Graph;Let $P$ be a set of $n \geq 5$ points in convex position in the plane. The path graph $G(P)$ of $P$ is an abstract graph whose vertices are non-crossing spanning paths of $P$, such that two paths are adjacent if one can be obtained from the other by deleting an edge and adding another edge. <br />We prove that the automorphism group of $G(P)$ is isomorphic to $D_{n}$, the dihedral group of order $2n$. The heart of the proof is an algorithm that first identifies the vertices of $G(P)$ that correspond to boundary paths of $P$, where the identification is unique up to an automorphism of $K(P)$ as a geometric graph, and then identifies (uniquely) all edges of each path represented by a vertex of $G(P)$. The complexity of the algorithm is $O(N \log N)$ where $N$ is the number of vertices of $G(P)$.;math.CO
1801.00331;On Operator Valued Measures;We consider positive operator valued measures whose image is the bounded operators acting on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, and we relax, when possible, the usual assumption of positivity of the operator valued measure seen in the quantum information theory literature. We define the Radon-Nikodym derivative of a positive operator valued measure with respect to a complex measure induced by a given quantum state, this derivative does not always exist when the Hilbert space is infinite dimensional in so much as its range may include unbounded operators. We define integrability of a positive quantum random variable with respect to a positive operator valued measure. Emphasis is put on the structure of operator valued measures, and we develop positive operator valued versions of the Lebesque decomposition theorem and Johnson's atomic and nonatomic decomposition theorem. Beyond these generalizations, we make connections between absolute continuity and the "cleanness" relation defined on positive operator valued measures as well as to the notion of atomic and nonatomic measures.;math.FA
1801.00333;Quickest drift change detection in L&#xe9,vy-type force of mortality model;In this paper we give solution to the quickest drift change detection problem for a L\'evy process consisting of both a continuous Gaussian part and a jump component. We consider here Bayesian framework with an exponential a priori distribution of the change point using an optimality criterion based on a probability of false alarm and an expected delay of the detection. Our approach is based on the optimal stopping theory and solving some boundary value problem. Paper is supplemented by an extensive numerical analysis related with the construction of the Generalized Shiryaev-Roberts statistics. In particular, we apply this method (after appropriate calibration) to analyse Polish life tables and to model the force of mortality in this population with a drift changing in time.;math.OC
1801.00334;Newton-Okounkov polytopes of Bott-Samelson varieties as Minkowski sums;We compute the Newton--Okounkov bodies of line bundles on a Bott--Samelson resolution of the complete flag variety of $GL_n$ for a geometric valuation coming from a flag of translated Schubert subvarieties. The Bott--Samelson resolution corresponds to the decomposition $(s_1)(s_2s_1)(s_3s_2s_1)(\ldots)(s_{n-1}\ldots s_1)$ of the longest element in the Weyl group, and the Schubert subvarieties correspond to the terminal subwords in this decomposition. We prove that the resulting Newton--Okounkov polytopes for semiample line bundles satisfy the additivity property with respect to the Minkowski sum. In particular, they are Minkowski sums of Newton--Okounkov polytopes of line bundles on the complete flag varieties for $GL_2$,\ldots, $GL_{n}$.;math.AG
1801.00335;Plato&#x27,s cave and differential forms;In the 1970s and again in the 1990s, Gromov gave a number of theorems and conjectures motivated by the notion that the real homotopy theory of compact manifolds and simplicial complexes influences the geometry of maps between them. The main technical result of this paper supports this intuition: we show that maps of differential algebras are closely shadowed, in a technical sense, by maps between the corresponding spaces. As a concrete application, we prove the following conjecture of Gromov: if $X$ and $Y$ are finite complexes with $Y$ simply connected, then there are constants $C(X,Y)$ and $p(X,Y)$ such that any two homotopic $L$-Lipschitz maps have a $C(L+1)^p$-Lipschitz homotopy (and if one of the maps is a constant, $p$ can be taken to be $2$.) We hope that it will lead more generally to a better understanding of the space of maps from $X$ to $Y$ in this setting.;math.GT
1801.00339;A Harmonic Analysis Proof of the Boundary Observability Inequality for the Wave Equation and Visco-Elastic Equation;In this paper, we give a harmonic analysis proof of the Neumann boundary observability inequality for the wave equation in an arbitrary space dimension. Our proof is elementary in nature and gives a simple, explicit constant. We also extend the method to prove the observability inequality of a visco-elastic wave equation.;math.AP
1801.00341;Breaking the curse of dimension in multi-marginal Kantorovich optimal transport on finite state spaces;We present a new ansatz space for the general symmetric multi-marginal Kantorovich optimal transport problem on finite state spaces which reduces the number of unknowns from $\tbinom{N+\ell-1}{\ell-1}$ to $\ell\cdot(N+1)$, where $\ell$ is the number of marginal states and $N$ the number of marginals. <br />The new ansatz space is a careful low-dimensional enlargement of the Monge class, which corresponds to $\ell\cdot(N-1)$ unknowns, and cures the insufficiency of the Monge ansatz, i.e. we show that the Kantorovich problem always admits a minimizer in the enlarged class, for arbitrary cost functions. <br />Our results apply, in particular, to the discretization of multi-marginal optimal transport with Coulomb cost in three dimensions, which has received much recent interest due to its emergence as the strongly correlated limit of Hohenberg-Kohn density functional theory. In this context $N$ corresponds to the number of particles, motivating the interest in large $N$.;math.AP
1801.00343;Limit points of subsequences;Let $x$ be a sequence taking values in a separable metric space and $\mathcal{I}$ be a generalized density ideal or an $F_\sigma$-ideal on the positive integers (in particular, $\mathcal{I}$ can be any Erd{\H o}s--Ulam ideal or any summable ideal). It is shown that the collection of subsequences of $x$ which preserve the set of $\mathcal{I}$-cluster points of $x$ [respectively, $\mathcal{I}$-limit points] is of second category if and only if the set of $\mathcal{I}$-cluster points of $x$ [resp., $\mathcal{I}$-limit points] coincides with the set of ordinary limit points of $x$, moreover, in this case, it is comeager. In particular, it follows that the collection of subsequences of $x$ which preserve the set of ordinary limit points of $x$ is comeager.;math.GN
1801.00347;Extensions of submanifold theory to non-real settings, with applications;In this thesis, we study extensions of the theory of Riemannian submanifolds in two directions. First, we will show how Riemannian geometry and submanifold theory in particular, can be generalized using the notion of 'Rinehart spaces', and it will be demonstrated how the developed framework unifies some existing and new flavours of Riemannian geometry over different ground rings. In the second part of the thesis, we give a description of holomorphic Riemannian submanifold theory where complex numbers fully replace the role of the real numbers as ground field, and show how this can be applied to reveal direct connections between the submanifolds of so-called Wick-related pseudo-Riemannian spaces.;math.DG
1801.00348;Dynamical zeta functions for Axiom A flows;We show that the Ruelle zeta function of any smooth Axiom A flow with orientable stable/unstable spaces has a meromorphic continuation to the entire complex plane. The proof uses the meromorphic continuation result of [<a href="/abs/1410.5516">arXiv:1410.5516</a>] together with the work of Conley-Easton and [<a href="/abs/1711.10059">arXiv:1711.10059</a>] which imply that every basic hyperbolic set can be put into the framework of [<a href="/abs/1410.5516">arXiv:1410.5516</a>].;math.DS
1801.00351;Isoparametric functions on $\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{M}^m$;We classify the isoparametric functions on $\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{M}^m$, $n, m\geq2$, with compact level sets, where $\mathbb{M}^m$ is a connected, closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $m$. Also, we classify the isoparametric hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{R}^2$ with constant principal curvatures.;math.DG
1801.00352;Coherence, squeezing and entanglement -- an example of peaceful coexistence;After exhaustive inspection of bosonic coherent states appearing in physical literature two of us, Horzela and Szafraniec, came in 2012 to the reasonably general definition which relies exclusively on reproducing kernels. The basic feature of coherent states, which is the resolution of the identity, is preserved though it now achieves advantageous form of the Segal-Bargmann transform. <br />It turns out that the aforesaid definition is not only extremely economical but also puts under a common umbrella typical coherent states as well as those which are squeezed and entangled. We examine the case here on the groundwork of holomorphic Hermite polynomials in one and two variables. An interesting side of this story is how some limit procedure allows disentangling.;math-ph
1801.00353;Generic pro-$p$ Hecke algebras;This is an extended and corrected version of the author's Diplomarbeit. A class of algebras called generic pro-$p$ Hecke algebras is introduced, enlarging the class of generic Hecke algebras by considering certain extensions of (extended) Coxeter groups. Examples of generic pro-$p$ Hecke algebras are given by pro-$p$-Iwahori Hecke algebras and Yokonuma-Hecke algebras. The notion of an orientation of a Coxeter group is introduced and used to define `Bernstein maps' intimately related to Bernstein's presentation and to Cherednik's cocycle. It is shown that certain relations in the Hecke algebra hold true, equivalent to Bernstein's relations in the case of Iwahori-Hecke algebras. <br />For a certain subclass called affine pro-$p$ Hecke algebras, containing Iwahori-Hecke and pro-$p$-Iwahori Hecke algebras, an explicit canonical and integral basis of the center is constructed and finiteness results are proved about the center and the module-structure of the algebra over its center, recovering results of Bernstein-Zelevinsky-Lusztig and Vign\'eras.;math.RT
1801.00355;Analytic computable structure theory and $L^p$-spaces part 2;Suppose $p \geq 1$ is a computable real. We extend previous work of Clanin, Stull, and McNicholl by classifying the computable $L^p$ spaces whose underlying measure spaces are atomic but not purely atomic. In addition, we determine the degrees of categoricity of these spaces and the complexity of associated projection maps.;math.LO
1801.00357;The global dimension of the algebra of the monoid of all partial functions on an $n$-set as the algebra of the EI-category of epimorphisms between subsets;We prove that the global dimension of the complex algebra of the monoid of all partial functions on an n-set is $n-1$ for all $n\geq 1$. This is also the global dimension of the complex algebra of the category of all epimorphisms between subsets of an $n$-set. In our proof we use standard homological methods as well as combinatorial techniques associated to the representation theory of the symmetric group. As part of the proof, we obtain a partial description of the Cartan matrix of these algebras.;math.RT
1801.00360;Geometric Perturbation Theory for a Class of Fiber Bundles;A systematic study of small, time-dependent, perturbations to geometric wave-equation domains is hardly existent. Acoustic enclosures are typical examples featuring locally reacting surfaces that respond to a pressure gradient or a pressure difference, alter the enclosure's volume and, hence, the boundary conditions, and do so locally through their vibrations. Accordingly, the Laplace-Beltrami operator in the acoustic wave equation lives in a temporally varying domain depending on the displacement of the locally reacting surface from equilibrium. The resulting partial differential equations feature nonlinearities and are coupled though the time-dependent boundary conditions. The solution to the afore-mentioned problem, as presented here, integrates techniques from differential geometry, functional analysis, and physics. The appropriate space is shown to be a (perturbation) fiber bundle. In the context of a systematic perturbation theory, the solution to the dynamical problem is obtained from a combination of semigroup techniques for operator evolution equations and metric perturbation theory as used in AdS/CFT. Duhamel's principle then yields a time-dependent perturbation theory, called geometric perturbation theory. It is analogous to, though different from, both Dirac's time-dependent perturbation theory and the Magnus expansion. Specifically, the formalism demonstrates that the stationary-domain approximation for vibrational acoustics only introduces a small error. Analytic simplifications methods are derived in the framework of the piston approximation. Globally reacting surfaces (so-called pistons) replace the formerly locally reacting surfaces and reduce the number of independent variables in the underlying partial differential equations. In this way, a straightforwardly applicable formalism is derived for scalar wave equations on time-varying domains.;math-ph
1801.00366;Szeg&#xf6, Limit Theorems for Singular Berezin-Toeplitz Operators;We consider Berezin-Toeplitz operators whose multipliers are compactly supported densities carried by a submanifold of ${\mathbb C}^N$ . We compute asymptotically the moments of their spectral measures, and we prove Szeg\"o limit theorems in cases when the submanifold is isotropic or co-isotropic, from which Weyl estimates follow. We also obtain asymptotics of the Schatten norms of such operators. Rescaled versions of these operators can be thought of as quantum mechanical mixed states, and our results give the semi-classical limit of their entropy.;math.SP
1801.00367;Examples of sharp asymptotic profiles of singular solutions to an elliptic equation with a sign-changing non-linearity;The first two authors [Proc. Lond. Math. Soc. (3) {\bf 114}(1):1--34, 2017] classified the behaviour near zero for all positive solutions of the perturbed elliptic equation with a critical Hardy--Sobolev growth <br />$$-\Delta u=|x|^{-s} u^{2^\star(s)-1} -\mu u^q \hbox{ in }B\setminus\{0\},$$ where $B$ denotes the open unit ball centred at $0$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n\geq 3$, $s\in (0,2)$, $2^\star(s):=2(n-s)/(n-2)$, $\mu&gt,0$ and $q&gt,1$. For $q\in (1,2^\star-1)$ with $2^\star=2n/(n-2)$, it was shown in the op. cit. that the positive solutions with a non-removable singularity at $0$ could exhibit up to three different singular profiles, although their existence was left open. In the present paper, we settle this question for all three singular profiles in the maximal possible range. As an important novelty for $\mu&gt,0$, we prove that for every $q\in (2^\star(s) -1,2^\star-1)$ there exist infinitely many positive solutions satisfying $|x|^{s/(q-2^\star(s)+1)}u(x)\to \mu^{-1/(q-2^\star(s)+1)}$ as $|x|\to 0$, using a dynamical system approach. Moreover, we show that there exists a positive singular solution with $\liminf_{|x|\to 0} |x|^{(n-2)/2} u(x)=0$ and <br />$\limsup_{|x|\to 0} |x|^{(n-2)/2} u(x)\in (0,\infty)$ if (and only if) $q\in (2^\star-2,2^\star-1)$.;math.AP
1801.00368;Stable rank one matrix completion is solved by two rounds of semidefinite programming relaxation;This paper studies the problem of deterministic rank-one matrix completion. It is known that the simplest semidefinite programming relaxation, involving minimization of the nuclear norm, does not in general return the solution for this problem. In this paper, we show that in every instance where the problem has a unique solution, one can provably recover the original matrix through two rounds of semidefinite programming relaxation with minimization of the trace norm. We further show that the solution of the proposed semidefinite program is Lipschitz-stable with respect to perturbations of the observed entries, unlike more basic algorithms such as nonlinear propagation or ridge regression. Our proof is based on recursively building a certificate of optimality corresponding to a dual sum-of-squares (SOS) polynomial. This SOS polynomial is built from the polynomial ideal generated by the completion constraints and the monomials provided by the minimization of the trace. The proposed relaxation fits in the framework of the Lasserre hierarchy, albeit with the key addition of the trace objective function. We further show how to represent and manipulate the moment tensor in favorable complexity by means of a hierarchical low-rank decomposition.;math.NA
1801.00370;Lie Pseudogroups &#xe0, la Cartan;We present a modern formulation of \'Elie Cartan's structure theory for Lie pseudogroups and prove a reduction theorem that clarifies the role of Cartan's systatic system. The paper is divided into three parts. In part one, using notions coming from the theory of Lie groupoids and algebroids, we introduce the framework of Cartan algebroids and realizations, structures that encode Cartan's structure equations and notion of a pseudogroup in normal form. In part two, we present a novel proof of Cartan's Second Fundamental Theorem, which states that any Lie pseudogroup is equivalent to a pseudogroup in normal form. In part three, we prove a new reduction theorem that states that, under suitable regularity conditions, a pseudogroup in normal form canonically reduces to a generalized pseudogroup of local solutions of a Lie-Pfaffian groupoid.;math.DG
1801.00375;Modular forms from Noether-Lefschetz theory;We enumerate smooth rational curves on very general Weierstrass fibrations over hypersurfaces in projective space. The generating functions for these numbers lie in the ring of classical modular forms. The method of proof uses topological intersection products on a period stack and the cohomological theta correspondence of Kudla and Millson for special cycles on a locally symmetric space of orthogonal type. The results here apply only in base degree 1, but heuristics for higher base degree match predictions from the topological string partition function.;math.AG
1801.00378;Tropical geometry of genus two curves;We exploit three classical characterizations of smooth genus two curves to study their tropical and analytic counterparts. First, we provide a combinatorial rule to determine the dual graph of each algebraic curve and the metric structure on the associated minimal Berkovich skeleton. Our main tool is the description of genus two curves via hyperelliptic covers of P^1 with six branch points. Given the valuations of these six points and their differences, our algorithm provides an explicit harmonic 2-to-1 map to a metric tree on six leaves. Second, we use tropical modifications to produce a faithful tropicalization in dimension three starting from a planar hyperelliptic embedding. <br />Finally, we consider the moduli space of abstract genus two tropical curves and translate the classical Igusa invariants characterizing isomorphism classes of genus two algebraic curves into the tropical realm. While these tropical Igusa functions do not yield coordinates in the tropical moduli space, we propose an alternative set of invariants that provides new length data.;math.AG
1801.00379;Word maps, word maps with constants and representation varieties of one-relator groups;We consider word maps and word maps with constants on a simple algebraic group. We present results on the images of such maps, in particular, we prove a theorem on the dominance of general word maps with constants, which can be viewed as an analogue of a well-known theorem of Borel on the dominance of genuine word maps. Besides, we establish a relationship between the existence of unipotents in the image of a word map and the structure of the corresponding representation variety.;math.GR
1801.00380;On Variable Ordination of Modified Cholesky Decomposition for Sparse Covariance Matrix Estimation;Estimation of large sparse covariance matrices is of great importance for statistical analysis, especially in the high-dimensional settings. The traditional approach such as the sample covariance matrix performs poorly due to the high dimensionality. The modified Cholesky decomposition (MCD) is a commonly used method for sparse covariance matrix estimation. However, the MCD method relies on the order of variables, which is often not available or cannot be pre-determined in practice. In this work, we solve this order issue by obtaining a set of covariance matrix estimates under different orders of variables used in the MCD. Then we consider an ensemble estimator as the "center" of such a set of covariance matrix estimates with respect to the Frobenius norm. The proposed method not only ensures the estimator to be positive definite, but also can capture the underlying sparse structure of the covariance matrix. Under some weak regularity conditions, we establish both algorithmic convergence and asymptotical convergence of the proposed method. The merits of the proposed method are illustrated through simulation studies and one real data example.;math.ST
1801.00381;Word maps on perfect algebraic groups;We extend Borel's theorem on the dominance of word maps from semisimple algebraic groups to some perfect groups. In another direction, we generalize Borel's theorem to some words with constants. We also consider the surjectivity problem for particular words and groups, give a brief survey of recent results, present some generalizations and variations and discuss various approaches, with emphasis on new ideas, constructions and connections.;math.GR
1801.00387;Diversity Analysis of Millimeter-Wave Massive MIMO Systems;This paper is concerned with asymptotic diversity analysis for millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive MIMO systems. First, for a single-user mmWave system employing distributed antenna subarray architecture in which the transmitter and receiver consist of Kt and Kr subarrays, respectively, a diversity gain theorem is established when the numbers of antennas at subarrays go to infinity. Specifically, assuming that all subchannels have the same number of propagation paths L, the theorem states that by employing such a distributed antenna-subarray architecture, a diversity gain of KrKtL-Ns+1 can be achieved, where Ns is the number of data streams. This result means that compared to the co-located antenna architecture, using the distributed antenna-subarray architecture can scale up the diversity gain or multiplexing gain proportionally to KrKt. The diversity gain analysis is then extended to the multiuser scenario as well as the scenario with conventional partially-connected RF structure in the literature. Simulation results obtained with the hybrid analog/digital processing corroborate the analysis results and show that the distributed subarray architecture indeed yields significantly better diversity performance than the co-located antenna architectures.;cs.IT
1801.00391;Rate of convergence in periodic homogenization of Hamilton-Jacobi equations: the convex setting;We study the rate of convergence of $u^\epsilon$, as $\epsilon \to 0+$, to $u$ in periodic homogenization of Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Here, $u^\epsilon$ and $u$ are viscosity solutions to the oscillatory Hamilton-Jacobi equation and its effective equation \begin{equation*} {\rm (C)_\epsilon} \qquad \begin{cases} u_t^\epsilon+H\left(\frac{x}{\epsilon},Du^\epsilon\right)=0 \qquad &amp,\text{in} \ \mathbb{R}^n \times (0,\infty), u^\epsilon(x,0)=g(x) \qquad &amp,\text{on} \ \mathbb{R}^n, \end{cases} \end{equation*} and \begin{equation*} {\rm (C)} \qquad \begin{cases} u_t+\overline{H}\left(Du\right)=0 \qquad &amp,\text{in} \ \mathbb{R}^n \times (0,\infty), u(x,0)=g(x) \qquad &amp,\text{on} \ \mathbb{R}^n, \end{cases} \end{equation*} respectively. We assume that the Hamiltonian $H=H(y,p)$ is coercive and convex in the $p$ variable and is $\mathbb{Z}^n$-periodic in the $y$ variable, and the initial data $g$ is bounded and Lipschitz continuous.;math.AP
1801.00392;Exponents of class groups of certain imaginary quadratic fields;Let $n&gt,1$ be an odd integer. We prove that there are infinitely many imaginary quadratic fields of the form $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{x^2-2y^n})$ whose ideal class group has an element of order $n$. This family gives a counter example to a conjecture by H. Wada \cite{WA70} on the structure of ideal class groups.;math.NT
1801.00394;Generalized Compression Strategy for the Downlink Cloud Radio Access Network;This paper studies the downlink of a cloud radio access network (C-RAN) in which a centralized processor (CP) communicates with mobile users through base stations (BSs) that are connected to the CP via finite-capacity fronthaul links. Information theoretically, the downlink of a C-RAN is modeled as a two-hop broadcast-relay network. Among the various transmission and relaying strategies for such model, this paper focuses on the compression strategy, in which the CP centrally encodes the signals to be broadcasted jointly by the BSs, then compresses and sends these signals to the BSs through the fronthaul links. This paper characterizes an achievable rate region for a generalized compression strategy with Marton's multicoding for broadcasting and multivariate compression for fronthaul transmission. We then compare this rate region with the distributed decode-forward (DDF) scheme, which achieves the capacity of the general relay networks to within a constant gap, and show that the difference lies in that DDF performs Marton's multicoding and multivariate compression jointly as opposed to successively as in the compression strategy. A main result of this paper is that under the assumption that the fronthaul links are subject to a \emph{sum} capacity constraint this difference is immaterial, so the successive encoding based compression strategy can already achieve the capacity region of the C-RAN to within a constant gap, where the gap is independent of the channel parameters and the power constraints at the BSs. For the special case of the Gaussian network, we further establish that under individual fronthaul constraints, the compression strategy achieves to within a constant gap to the \emph{sum} capacity of the C-RAN.;cs.IT
1801.00396;Towards multifractional calculus;After motivating the need of a multiscale version of fractional calculus in quantum gravity, we review current proposals and the program to be carried out in order to reach a viable definition of scale-dependent fractional operators. We present different types of multifractional Laplacians and comment on their known or expected properties.;math-ph
1801.00398;Scalable Hash-Based Estimation of Divergence Measures;We propose a scalable divergence estimation method based on hashing. Consider two continuous random variables $X$ and $Y$ whose densities have bounded support. We consider a particular locality sensitive random hashing, and consider the ratio of samples in each hash bin having non-zero numbers of Y samples. We prove that the weighted average of these ratios over all of the hash bins converges to f-divergences between the two samples sets. We show that the proposed estimator is optimal in terms of both MSE rate and computational complexity. We derive the MSE rates for two families of smooth functions, the H\"{o}lder smoothness class and differentiable functions. In particular, it is proved that if the density functions have bounded derivatives up to the order $d/2$, where $d$ is the dimension of samples, the optimal parametric MSE rate of $O(1/N)$ can be achieved. The computational complexity is shown to be $O(N)$, which is optimal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical divergence estimator that has optimal computational complexity and achieves the optimal parametric MSE estimation rate.;cs.IT
1801.00399;Computation of Maximal Determinants of Binary Circulant Matrices;We describe algorithms for computing maximal determinants of binary circulant matrices of small orders. Here "binary matrix" means a matrix whose elements are drawn from $\{0,1\}$ or $\{-1,1\}$. We describe efficient parallel algorithms for the search, using Duval's algorithm for generation of necklaces and the well-known representation of the determinant of a circulant in terms of roots of unity. Tables of maximal determinants are given for orders $\le 53$ (in the first case) or $\le 52$ (in the second case). Our computations extend earlier results and disprove two plausible conjectures.;math.CO
1801.00400;Value Functions and Optimality Conditions for Nonconvex Variational Problems with an Infinite Horizon in Banach Spaces;We investigate the value function of an infinite horizon variational problem in the infinite-dimensional setting. Firstly, we provide an upper estimate of its Dini--Hadamard subdifferential in terms of the Clarke subdifferential of the Lipschitz continuous integrand and the Clarke normal cone to the graph of the set-valued mapping describing dynamics. Secondly, we derive a necessary condition for optimality in the form of an adjoint inclusion that grasps a connection between the Euler--Lagrange condition and the maximum principle.;math.OC
1801.00403;Exact eigenfunction amplitude distributions of integrable quantum billiards;The exact probability distributions of the amplitudes of eigenfunctions, $\Psi(x, y)$, of several integrable planar billiards are analytically calculated and shown to possess singularities at $\Psi = 0$, the nature of this singularity is shape-dependent. In particular, we prove that the distribution function for a rectangular quantum billiard is proportional to the complete elliptic integral, ${\bf K}(1 - \Psi ^2)$, and demonstrate its universality, modulo a weak dependence on quantum numbers. On the other hand, we study the low-lying states of nonseparable, integrable triangular billiards and find the distributions thereof to be described by the Meijer G-function or certain hypergeometric functions. Our analysis captures a marked departure from the Gaussian distributions for chaotic billiards in its survey of the fluctuations of the eigenfunctions about $\Psi = 0$.;math-ph
1801.00406;Reduced Dimensional Optimal Vector Linear Index Codes for Index Coding Problems with Symmetric Neighboring and Consecutive Side-information;A single unicast index coding problem (SUICP) with symmetric neighboring and consecutive side-information (SNCS) has $K$ messages and $K$ receivers, the $k$th receiver $R_k$ wanting the $k$th message $x_k$ and having the side-information $\mathcal{K}_k=\{x_{k-U},\dots,x_{k-2},x_{k-1}\}\cup\{x_{k+1}, x_{k+2},\dots,x_{k+D}\}$. The single unicast index coding problem with symmetric neighboring and consecutive side-information, SUICP(SNCS), is motivated by topological interference management problems in wireless communication networks. Maleki, Cadambe and Jafar obtained the symmetric capacity of this SUICP(SNCS) and proposed optimal length codes by using Vandermonde matrices. In our earlier work, we gave optimal length $(U+1)$-dimensional vector linear index codes for SUICP(SNCS) satisfying some conditions on $K,D$ and $U$ \cite{VaR1}. In this paper, for SUICP(SNCS) with arbitrary $K,D$ and $U$, we construct optimal length $\frac{U+1}{\text{gcd}(K,D-U,U+1)}$-dimensional vector linear index codes. We prove that the constructed vector linear index code is of minimal dimension if $\text{gcd}(K-D+U,U+1)$ is equal to $\text{gcd}(K,D-U,U+1)$. The proposed construction gives optimal length scalar linear index codes for the SUICP(SNCS) if $(U+1)$ divides both $K$ and $D-U$. The proposed construction is independent of field size and works over every field. We give a low-complexity decoding for the SUICP(SNCS). By using the proposed decoding method, every receiver is able to decode its wanted message symbol by simply adding some index code symbols (broadcast symbols).;cs.IT
1801.00410;Enhanced ${q}$-Least Mean Square;In this work, a new class of stochastic gradient algorithm is developed based on $q$-calculus. Unlike the existing $q$-LMS algorithm, the proposed approach fully utilizes the concept of $q$-calculus by incorporating time-varying $q$ parameter. The proposed enhanced $q$-LMS ($Eq$-LMS) algorithm utilizes a novel, parameterless concept of error-correlation energy and normalization of signal to ensure high convergence, stability and low steady-state error. The proposed algorithm automatically adapts the learning rate with respect to the error. For the evaluation purpose the system identification problem is considered. Extensive experiments show better performance of the proposed $Eq$-LMS algorithm compared to the standard $q$-LMS approach.;math.OC
1801.00413;Hitting Time Quasi-metric and Its Forest Representation;Let $\hat m_{ij}$ be the hitting (mean first passage) time from state $i$ to state $j$ in an $n$-state ergodic homogeneous Markov chain with transition matrix $T$. Let $\Gamma$ be the weighted digraph whose vertex set coincides with the set of states of the Markov chain and arc weights are equal to the corresponding transition probabilities. It holds that $$ \hat m_{ij}= q_j^{-1}\cdot \begin{cases} f_{ij},&amp,\text{if }\,\, i\ne j,\\ q, &amp,\text{if }\,\, i=j, \end{cases} $$ where $f_{ij}$ is the total weight of 2-tree spanning converging forests in $\Gamma$ that have one tree containing $i$ and the other tree converging to $j$, $q_j$ is the total weight of spanning trees converging to $j$ in $\Gamma,$ and $q=\sum_{j=1}^nq_j$ is the total weight of all spanning trees in $\Gamma.$ Moreover, $f_{ij}$ and $q_j$ can be calculated by an algebraic recurrent procedure. A forest expression for Kemeny's constant is an immediate consequence of this result. Further, we discuss the properties of the hitting time quasi-metric $m$ on the set of vertices of $\Gamma$: $m(i,j)=\hat m_{ij}$, $i\neq j$, and $m(i,i)=0$. We also consider a number of other metric structures on the set of graph vertices related to the hitting time quasi-metric $m$---along with various connections between them. The notions and relationships under study are illustrated by two examples.;math.CO
1801.00416;Permutations with small maximal $k$-consecutive sums;Let $n$ and $k$ be positive integers with $n&gt,k$. Given a permutation $(\pi_1,\ldots,\pi_n)$ of integers $1,\ldots,n$, we consider $k$-consecutive sums of $\pi$, i.e., $s_i:=\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}\pi_{i+j}$ for $i=1,\ldots,n$, where we let $\pi_{n+j}=\pi_j$. What we want to do in this paper is to know the exact value of $$\mathrm{msum}(n,k):=\min\left\{\max\{s_i : i=1,\ldots,n\} -\frac{k(n+1)}{2}: \pi \in S_n\right\},$$ where $S_n$ denotes the set of all permutations of $1,\ldots,n$. In this paper, we determine the exact values of $\mathrm{msum}(n,k)$ for some particular cases of $n$ and $k$. As a corollary of the results, we obtain $\mathrm{msum}(n,3)$, $\mathrm{msum}(n,4)$ and $\mathrm{msum}(n,6)$ for any $n$.;math.CO
1801.00417;Construction of $J^{\text{th}}$-stage Nonuniform Wavelets on Local Fields;Shah and Abdullah [Complex Analysis Operator Theory, 9 (2015), 1589-1608] have introduced a generalized notion of nonuniform multiresolution analysis (NUMRA) on local field $K$ of positive characteristic in which the translation set $\Lambda$ acting on the scaling function to generate the core space $V_{0}$ is no longer a group, but is the union of ${\mathcal Z}$ and a translate of ${\mathcal Z}$, given by $\Lambda=\left\{0,u(r)/N \right\}+{\mathcal Z}$, where $N \ge 1$ is an integer and $r$ is an odd integer such that $r$ and $N$ are relatively prime, and ${\mathcal Z}=\{u(n): n\in\mathbb N_{0}\}$ is a complete list of distinct cosets of the unit disc $\mathfrak D$ in $K^+.$ In this paper, we focus on the extension of nonuniform continuous wavelets to the construction of $J^{\text{th}}$-stage nonuniform discrete wavelets on local fields. We establish some general characterizations for the $J^{\text{th}}$-stage nonuniform discrete wavelet systems to be orthornormal bases in $L^2(\Lambda)$. Moreover, we establish a relation between the continuous wavelets of $L^2(K)$ and their discrete counterparts of $l^2(\Lambda)$.;math.FA
1801.00419;A study concerning splitting and jointly continuous topologies on $C(Y,Z)$;Let $Y$ and $Z$ be two fixed topological spaces and $C(Y,Z)$ the set of all continuous maps from $Y$ into $Z$. We construct and study topologies on $C(Y,Z)$ that we call ${\cal F}_n(\tau_n)$-family-open topologies. Furthermore, we find necessary and sufficient conditions such that these topologies to be splitting and jointly continuous. Finally, we present questions concerning a further study on this area.;math.GN
1801.00420;Existence and uniqueness of solutions for a quasilinear KdV equation with degenerate dispersion;We consider a quasilinear KdV equation that admits compactly supported traveling wave solutions (compactons). This model is one of the most straightforward instances of degenerate dispersion, a phenomenon that appears in a variety of physical settings as diverse as sedimentation, magma dynamics and shallow water waves. We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions with sufficiently smooth, spatially localized initial data.;math.AP
1801.00421;Three-dimensional Ricci-degenerate Riemannian manifolds satisfying geometric equations;In this paper, we study a three-dimensional Ricci-degenerate Riemannian manifold $(M^3,g)$ that admits a smooth nonzero solution $f$ to the equation \begin{align} \label{a1a} <br />\nabla df=\psi Rc+\phi g, \end{align} where $\psi,\phi$ are given smooth functions of $f$, $Rc$ is the Ricci tensor of $g$. Spaces of this type include various interesting classes, namely gradient Ricci solitons, $m$-quasi Einstein metrics, (vacuum) static spaces, $V$-static spaces, and critical point metrics. <br />The $m$-quasi Einstein metrics and vacuum static spaces were previously studied in \cite{JJ,JEK}, respectively. In this paper, we refine them and develop a general approach for the solutions of (\ref{a1a}), we specify the shape of the metric $g$ satisfying (\ref{a1a}) when $\nabla f$ is not a Ricci-eigen vector. Then we focus on the remaining three classes, namely gradient Ricci solitons, $V$-static spaces, and critical point metrics. Furthermore, we present classifications of local three-dimensional Ricci-degenerate spaces of these three classes by explicitly describing the metric $g$ and the potential function $f$.;math.DG
1801.00422;Espaces de Banach-Colmez et faisceaux coh&#xe9,rents sur la courbe de Fargues-Fontaine;We give a new definition, simpler but equivalent, of the abelian category of Banach-Colmez spaces introduced by Colmez, and we explain the precise relationship with the category of coherent sheaves on the Fargues-Fontaine curve. One goes from one category to the other by changing the t-structure on the derived category. Along the way, we obtain a description of the pro-\'etale cohomology of the open disk and the affine space, of independent interest.;math.NT

We show that if the elementary theory of $\mathcal M$ is decidable then (1) the relation $Q( a) \rightleftharpoons$ "there is an infinite branch in the tree $Tr( a,x,y)$" is definable in $\mathcal M$, and (2) if there is an infinite branch in the tree $Tr( a,x,y)$, then there is a definable in $\mathcal M$ infinite branch.;math.LO
1801.00427;Fermat&#x27,s dilemma: Why did he keep mum on infinitesimals? and the European theological context;The first half of the 17th century was a time of intellectual ferment when wars of natural philosophy were echoes of religious wars, as we illustrate by a case study of an apparently innocuous mathematical technique called adequality pioneered by the honorable judge Pierre de Fermat, its relation to indivisibles, as well as to other hocus-pocus. Andre Weil noted that simple applications of adequality involving polynomials can be treated purely algebraically but more general problems like the cycloid curve cannot be so treated and involve additional tools--leading the mathematician Fermat potentially into troubled waters. Breger attacks Tannery for tampering with Fermat's manuscript but it is Breger who tampers with Fermat's procedure by moving all terms to the left-hand side so as to accord better with Breger's own interpretation emphasizing the double root idea. We provide modern proxies for Fermat's procedures in terms of relations of infinite proximity as well as the standard part function. <br />Keywords: adequality, atomism, cycloid, hylomorphism, indivisibles, infinitesimal, jesuat, jesuit, Edict of Nantes, Council of Trent 13.2;math.HO

This cohomology theory factors through the category of rigid analytic motives of Ayoub.;math.NT
1801.00431;Ultra-Reliable Cooperative Short-Packet Communications with Wireless Energy Transfer;We analyze a cooperative wireless communication system with finite block length and finite battery energy, under quasi-static Rayleigh fading. Source and relay nodes are powered by a wireless energy transfer (WET) process, while using the harvested energy to feed their circuits, send pilot signals to estimate channels at receivers, and for wireless information transmission (WIT). Other power consumption sources beyond data transmission power are considered. The error probability is investigated under perfect/imperfect channel state information (CSI), while reaching accurate closed-form approximations in ideal direct communication system setups. We consider ultra-reliable communication (URC) scenarios under discussion for the next fifth-generation (5G) of wireless systems. The numerical results show the existence of an optimum pilot transmit power for channel estimation, which increases with the harvested energy. We also show the importance of cooperation, even taking into account the multiplexing loss, in order to meet the error and latency constraints of the URC systems.;cs.IT
1801.00435;Analysis and Code Design for the Binary CEO Problem under Logarithmic Loss;In this paper, we propose an efficient coding scheme for the binary Chief Executive Officer (CEO) problem under logarithmic loss criterion. Courtade and Weissman obtained the exact rate-distortion bound for a two-link binary CEO problem under this criterion. We find the optimal test-channel model and its parameters for the encoder of each link by using the given bound. Furthermore, an efficient encoding scheme based on compound LDGM-LDPC codes is presented to achieve the theoretical rates. In the proposed encoding scheme, a binary quantizer using LDGM codes and a syndrome-decoding employing LDPC codes are applied. An iterative decoding is also presented as a fusion center to reconstruct the observation bits. The proposed decoder consists of a sum-product algorithm with a side information from other decoder and a soft estimator. The output of the CEO decoder is the probability of source bits conditional to the received sequences of both links. This method outperforms the majority-based estimation of the source bits utilized in the prior studies of the binary CEO problem. Our numerical examples verify a close performance of the proposed coding scheme to the theoretical bound in several cases.;cs.IT
1801.00438;On eigenfunctions and maximal cliques of Paley graphs of square order;In this paper we find new maximal cliques of size $\frac{q+1}{2}$ or $\frac{q+3}{2}$, accordingly as $q\equiv 1(4)$ or $q\equiv 3(4)$, in Paley graphs of order $q^2$, where $q$ is an odd prime power. After that we use new cliques to define a family of eigenfunctions corresponding to both non-principal eigenvalues and having the cardinality of support $q+1$, which is the minimum by the weight-distribution bound.;math.CO

Given positive integers $a,b,c,k$ and an odd prime number $p$ with $p\nmid c$, we employ the theory of ternary quadratic forms to determine completely when the mixed sum $ax^2+by^2+cP_{p^k+2}(z)$ represents all but finitely many positive integers.;math.NT
1801.00443;Capacity Characterization of UAV-Enabled Two-User Broadcast Channel;Although prior works have exploited the UAV's mobility to enhance the wireless communication performance under different setups, the fundamental capacity limits of UAV-enabled/aided multiuser communication systems have not yet been characterized. To fill this gap, we consider in this paper a UAV-enabled two-user broadcast channel (BC), where a UAV flying at a constant altitude is deployed to send independent information to two users at different fixed locations on the ground. We aim to characterize the capacity region of this new type of BC over a given UAV flight duration, by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and transmit power/rate allocations over time, subject to the UAV's maximum speed and maximum transmit power constraints. First, to draw essential insights, we consider two special cases with asymptotically large/low UAV flight duration/speed, respectively. For the former case, it is shown that a simple hover-fly-hover (HFH) UAV trajectory with time division multiple access (TDMA) based orthogonal multiuser transmission is capacity-achieving, while in the latter case, the UAV should hover at a fixed location that is nearer to the user with larger achievable rate and in general superposition coding (SC) based non-orthogonal transmission with interference cancellation at the receiver of the nearer user is required. Next, we consider the general case with finite UAV speed and flight duration. We show that the optimal UAV trajectory should follow a general HFH structure, i.e., the UAV successively hovers at a pair of initial and final locations above the line segment of the two users each with a certain amount of time and flies unidirectionally between them at the maximum speed, and SC is generally needed.;cs.IT
1801.00444;Common Throughput Maximization in UAV-Enabled OFDMA Systems with Delay Consideration;The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as communication platforms is of great practical significance in future wireless networks, especially for on-demand deployment in temporary events and emergency situations. Although prior works have shown the performance improvement by exploiting the UAV's mobility, they mainly focus on delay-tolerant applications. As delay requirements fundamentally limit the UAV's mobility, it remains unknown whether the UAV is able to provide any performance gain in delay-constrained communication scenarios. Motivated by this, we study in this paper a UAV-enabled orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) network where a UAV is dispatched as a mobile base station (BS) to serve a group of users on the ground. We consider a minimum-rate ratio (MRR) for each user, defined as the minimum instantaneous rate required over the average achievable throughput, to flexibly adjust the percentage of its delay-constrained data traffic. Under a given set of constraints on the users' MRRs, we aim to maximize the minimum average throughput of all users by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory and OFDMA resource allocation. First, we show that the max-min throughput in general decreases as the users' MRR constraints become more stringent, which reveals a fundamental throughput-delay tradeoff in UAV-enabled communications. Next, we propose an iterative parameter-assisted block coordinate descent method to optimize the UAV trajectory and OFDMA resource allocation alternately, by applying the successive convex optimization and the Lagrange duality, respectively. Furthermore, an efficient and systematic UAV trajectory initialization scheme is proposed based on a simple circular trajectory. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs.;cs.IT
1801.00450;An Efficient, Second Order Accurate, Universal Generalized Riemann Problem Solver Based on the HLLI Riemann Solver;The Riemann problem, and the associated generalized Riemann problem, are increasingly seen as the important building blocks for modern higher order Godunov-type schemes. In the past, building a generalized Riemann problem solver was seen as an intricately mathematical task for complicated physical or engineering problems because the associated Riemann problem is different for each hyperbolic system of interest. This paper changes that situation. <br />The HLLI Riemann solver is a recently-proposed Riemann solver that is universal in that it is applicable to any hyperbolic system, whether in conservation form or with non-conservative products. The HLLI Riemann solver is also complete in the sense that if it is given a complete set of eigenvectors, it represents all waves with minimal dissipation. It is, therefore, very attractive to build a generalized Riemann problem solver version of the HLLI Riemann solver. This is the task that is accomplished in the present paper. We show that at second order, the generalized Riemann problem version of the HLLI Riemann solver is easy to design. Our GRP solver is also complete and universal because it inherits those good properties from original HLLI Riemann solver. We also show how our GRP solver can be adapted to the solution of hyperbolic systems with stiff source terms. <br />Our generalized HLLI Riemann solver is easy to implement and performs robustly and well over a range of test problems. All implementation-related details are presented. Results from several stringent test problems are shown. These test problems are drawn from many different hyperbolic systems, and include hyperbolic systems in conservation form, with non-conservative products, and with stiff source terms. The present generalized Riemann problem solver performs well on all of them.;math.NA
1801.00457;Kinetic layers and coupling conditions for nonlinear scalar equations on networks;We consider a kinetic relaxation model and an associated macroscopic scalar nonlinear hyperbolic equation on a network. Coupling conditions for the macroscopic equations are derived from the kinetic coupling conditions via an asymptotic analysis near the nodes of the network. This analysis leads to the combination of kinetic half-space problems with Riemann problems at the junction. Detailed numerical comparisons between the different models show the agreement of the coupling conditions for the case of tripod networks.;math.AP
1801.00459;Geometry of complex bounded domains with finite-volume quotients;We first show that for a bounded pseudoconvex domain with a manifold quotient of finite-volume in the sense of Kahler-Einstein measure, the identity component of the automorphism group of this domain is semi-simple without compact factors. This partially answers an open question in [Fra95]. Then we apply this result in different settings to solve several open problems, for examples, <br />(1). We prove that the automorphism group of the Griffiths domain [Gri71] in $\mathbb{C}^2$ is discrete. This gives a complete answer to an open question raised four decades ago. <br />(2). We show that for a contractible HHR/USq complex manifold $D$ with a finite-volume manifold quotient $M$, if $D$ contains a one-parameter group of holomorphic automorphisms and the fundamental group of $M$ is irreducible, then $D$ is biholomorphic to a bounded symmetric domain. This theorem can be viewed as a finite-volume version of Nadel-Frankel's solution for the Kahzdan conjecture, which has been open for years. <br />(3). We show that for a bounded convex domain $D\subset \mathbb{C}^n$ of $C^2$-smooth boundary, if $D$ has a finite-volume manifold quotient with an irreducible fundamental group, then $D$ is biholomorphic to the unit ball in $\mathbb{C}^n$, which partially solves an old conjecture of Yau. <br />For (2) and (3) above, if the complex dimension is equal to $2$, more refined results will be provided.;math.DG
1801.00463;On spectra of quadratic operator pencils with rank one gyroscopic linear part;The spectrum of a selfadjoint quadratic operator pencil of the form $\lambda^2M-\lambda G-A$ is investigated where $M\geq 0$, $G\geq 0$ are bounded operators and $A$ is selfadjoint bounded below is investigated. It is shown that in the case of rank one operator $G$ the eigenvalues of such a pencil are of two types. The eigenvalues of one of these types are independent of the operator $G$. Location of the eigenvalues of both types is described. Examples for the case of the Sturm-Liouville operators $A$ are given.;math-ph

For $n=3$, we get a detailed description of such spaces. The euclidean 2-spheres were considered by W. P. Thurston: for $n=4$, the corresponding spaces provide the famous 7 examples of nonarithmetic compact holomorphic 2-ball quotients previously constructed by Deligne-Mostow.;math.GT

1801.00468;On Equitable Coloring Parameters of Certain Cycle Related Graphs;Coloring the vertices of a graph G subject to given conditions can be considered as a random experiment and corresponding to this experiment, a discrete random variable X can be defined as the colour of a vertex chosen at random, with respect to the given type of colouring of G and a probability mass function for this random variable can be defined accordingly. A proper coloring C of a graph G, which assigns colors to the vertices of G such that the numbers of vertices in any two colour classes differ by at most one, is called an equitable colouring of G. In this paper, we study two statistical parameters of certain cycle related graphs, with respect to their equitable colorings.;math.GM
1801.00474;Anti-Ramsey Multiplicities;The Ramsey multiplicity constant of a graph $H$ is the minimum proportion of copies of $H$ in the complete graph which are monochromatic under an edge-coloring of $K_n$ as $n$ goes to infinity. Graphs for which this minimum is asymptotically achieved by taking a random coloring are called {\em common}, and common graphs have been studied extensively, leading to the Burr-Rosta conjecture and Sidorenko's conjecture. Erd\H{o}s and S\'os asked what the maximum number of rainbow triangles is in a $3$-coloring of the edge set of $K_n$, a rainbow version of the Ramsey multiplicity question. A graph $H$ is called $r$-anti-common if the maximum proportion of rainbow copies of $H$ in any $r$-coloring of $E(K_n)$ is asymptotically achieved by taking a random coloring. In this paper, we investigate anti-Ramsey multiplicity for several families of graphs. We determine classes of graphs which are either anti-common or not. Some of these classes follow the same behavior as the monochromatic case, but some of them do not. In particular the rainbow equivalent of Sidorenko's conjecture, that all bipartite graphs are anti-common, is false.;math.CO
1801.00480;The Cyclic Douglas-Rachford Algorithm with r-sets-Douglas-Rachford Operators;The Douglas-Rachford (DR) algorithm is an iterative procedure that uses sequential reflections onto convex sets and which has become popular for convex feasibility problems.

We prove convergence and present numerical illustrations of the potential advantage of such operators with $r&gt,2$ over the classical $2$-sets-DR operators in a cyclic algorithm.;math.OC
1801.00485;Rigorous results for the distribution of money on connected graphs;This paper is concerned with general spatially explicit versions of three stochastic models for the dynamics of money that have been introduced and studied numerically by statistical physicists: the uniform reshuffling model, the immediate exchange model and the model with saving propensity. All three models consist of systems of economical agents that consecutively engage in pairwise monetary transactions. Computer simulations performed in the physics literature suggest that, when the number of agents and the average amount of money per agent are large, the distribution of money at equilibrium approaches the exponential distribution for the first model, the gamma distribution with shape parameter two for the second model and a gamma distribution whose shape parameter depends on the saving propensity for the third model. The main objective of this paper is to give rigorous proofs of and extend these conjectures to generalizations of the first two models and a variant of the third model that include local rather than global interactions, i.e., instead of choosing the two interacting agents uniformly at random from the system, the agents are located on the vertex set of a general connected graph and can only interact with their neighbors.;math.PR

We show that the Feynman propagator is an example of a reproducing kernel under a boundedness condition. To every Lagrangian thus corresponds a Hilbert space that does not need to be postulated \emph{a priori}. For the free non-relativistic particle, we justify mathematically the concept of space-time granularity. Reproducing kernels allow for a functional, rather than distributional, description of the Hilbert spaces of quantum theory, including the Fock space.;math-ph

We end with some remarks on binary tensors.;math.CO
1801.00501;Hereditary Semiorders and Enumeration of Semiorders by Dimension;In 2010, Bousquet-M\'elou et al. defined sequences of nonnegative integers called ascent sequences and showed that the ascent sequences of length $n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the interval orders, i.e., the posets not containing the poset $\mathbf{2}+\mathbf{2}$. Through the use of generating functions, this provided an answer to the longstanding open question of enumerating the (unlabeled) interval orders. A semiorder is an interval order having a representation in which all intervals have the same length. In terms of forbidden subposets, the semiorders exclude $\mathbf{2}+\mathbf{2}$ and $\mathbf{1}+\mathbf{3}$. The number of unlabeled semiorders on $n$ points has long been known to be the $n$-th Catalan number. However, describing the ascent sequences that correspond to the semiorders under the bijection of Bousquet-M\'elou et al. has proved difficult. In this paper, we discuss a major part of the difficulty in this area: the ascent sequence corresponding to a semiorder may have an initial subsequence that corresponds to an interval order that is not a semiorder. <br />We define the hereditary semiorders to be those corresponding to an ascent sequence for which every initial subsequence also corresponds to a semiorder. We provide a structural result that characterizes the hereditary semiorders and use this characterization to determine the ordinary generating function for hereditary semiorders. We also use our characterization of hereditary semiorders and the characterization of semiorders of dimension 3 given by Rabinovitch to provide a structural description of the semiorders of dimension at most 2. From this description, we are able to determine the ordinary generating for the semiorders of dimension at most 2.;math.CO
1801.00502;Structure of the flow and Yamada polynomials of cubic graphs;We establish a quadratic identity for the Yamada polynomial of ribbon cubic graphs in 3-space, extending the Tutte golden identity for planar cubic graphs. An application is given to the structure of the flow polynomial of cubic graphs at zero. The golden identity for the flow polynomial is conjectured to characterize planarity of cubic graphs, and we prove this conjecture for a certain infinite family of non-planar graphs. <br />Further, we establish exponential growth of the number of chromatic polynomials of planar triangulations, answering a question of D. Treumann and E. Zaslow. The structure underlying these results is the chromatic algebra, and more generally the SO(3) topological quantum field theory.;math.CO
1801.00503;Smooth solutions to the complex Plateau problem;Building on work of Du, Gao, and Yau, we give a characterization of smooth solutions, up to normalization, of the complex Plateau problem for strongly pseudoconvex Calabi--Yau CR manifolds of dimension $2n-1 \ge 5$ and in the hypersurface case when $n=2$. The latter case was completely solved by Yau for $n \ge 3$ but only partially solved by Du and Yau for $n=2$. As an application, we determine the existence of a link-theoretic invariant of normal isolated singularities that distinguishes smooth points from singular ones.;math.CV
1801.00505;Optimal Stochastic Management of Distributed Energy Storage Embedded with Wind Farms;Increasing wind turbines (WT) penetration and low carbon demand can potentially lead to two different flow peaks, generation and load, within distribution networks. This will not only constrain WT penetration but also pose serious threats to network reliability. This paper proposes energy storage (ES) to reduce system congestion cost caused by the two peaks by sending cost-reflective economic signals to affect ES operation in responding to network conditions. Firstly, a new charging and discharging (C/D) strategy based on Binary Search Method is designed for ES, which responds to system congestion cost over time. Then, a novel pricing method, based on Location Marginal Pricing, is designed for ES. The pricing model is derived by evaluating ES impact on the network power flows and congestion from the loss and congestion components in Location Marginal Pricing. The impact is then converted into an hourly economic signal to reflect ES operation. The proposed ES C/D strategy and pricing methods are validated on a real local Grid Supply Point area. Results show that the proposed Location Marginal Pricing-based pricing is efficient to capture the feature of ES and provide signals for affecting its operation. This work can further increase network flexibility and the capability of networks to accommodate increasing WT penetration.;math.OC

1801.00513;An elementary derivation of the Chinese restaurant process from Sethuraman&#x27,s stick-breaking process;The Chinese restaurant process (CRP) and the stick-breaking process are the two most commonly used representations of the Dirichlet process. However, the usual proof of the connection between them is indirect, relying on abstract properties of the Dirichlet process that are difficult for nonexperts to verify. This short note provides a direct proof that the stick-breaking process leads to the CRP, without using any measure theory. We also discuss how the stick-breaking representation arises naturally from the CRP.;math.ST

Girstmair proved local restrictions on $k$ depending on $q\pmod{12}$ and whether $q$ is a square and conjectured that these are the only restrictions possible. We verify the conjecture in the cases $q$ even, $q$ a square divisible by $3$ or $5$, and $2\le q\le 200$ (the latter by computer), and provide progress towards a general approach.;math.NT
1801.00518;Statistical and Computational Limits for Sparse Matrix Detection;This paper investigates the fundamental limits for detecting a high-dimensional sparse matrix contaminated by white Gaussian noise from both the statistical and computational perspectives. We consider $p\times p$ matrices whose rows and columns are individually $k$-sparse. We provide a tight characterization of the statistical and computational limits for sparse matrix detection, which precisely describe when achieving optimal detection is easy, hard, or impossible, respectively. Although the sparse matrices considered in this paper have no apparent submatrix structure and the corresponding estimation problem has no computational issue at all, the detection problem has a surprising computational barrier when the sparsity level $k$ exceeds the cubic root of the matrix size $p$: attaining the optimal detection boundary is computationally at least as hard as solving the planted clique problem. <br />The same statistical and computational limits also hold in the sparse covariance matrix model, where each variable is correlated with at most $k$ others. A key step in the construction of the statistically optimal test is a structural property for sparse matrices, which can be of independent interest.;math.ST
1801.00521;Asymptotic Gap Probability Distributions of the Gaussian Unitary Ensembles and Jacobi Unitary Ensembles;In this paper, we address a class of problems in unitary ensembles. Specifically, we study the probability that a gap symmetric about 0, i.e. $(-a,a)$ is found in the Gaussian unitary ensembles (GUE) and the Jacobi unitary ensembles (JUE) (where in the JUE, we take the parameters $\alpha=\beta$). By exploiting the even parity of the weight, a doubling of the interval to $(a^2,\infty)$ for the GUE, and $(a^2,1)$, for the (symmetric) JUE, shows that the gap probabilities maybe determined as the product of the smallest eigenvalue distributions of the LUE with parameter $\alpha=-1/2,$ and $\alpha=1/2$ and the (shifted) JUE with weights $x^{1/2}(1-x)^{\beta}$ and $x^{-1/2}(1-x)^{\beta}$ The $\sigma$ function, namely, the derivative of the log of the smallest eigenvalue distributions of the finite-$n$ LUE or the JUE, satisfies the Jimbo-Miwa-Okamoto $\sigma$ form of $P_{V}$ and $P_{VI}$, although in the shift Jacobi case, with the weight $x^{\alpha}(1-x)^{\beta},$ the $\beta$ parameter does not show up in the equation. We also obtain the asymptotic expansions for the smallest eigenvalue distributions of the Laguerre unitary and Jacobi unitary ensembles after appropriate double scalings, and obtained the constants in the asymptotic expansion of the gap probablities, expressed in term of the Barnes $G-$ function valuated at special point.;math-ph
1801.00523;Interval estimators for ratios of independent quantiles and interquantile ranges;Recent research has shown that interval estimators with good coverage properties are achievable for some functions of quantiles, even when sample sizes are not large. Motivated by this, we consider interval estimators for the ratios of independent quantiles and interquantile ranges that will be useful when comparing location and scale for two samples. Simulations show that the intervals have excellent coverage properties for a wide range of distributions, including those that are heavily skewed. Examples are also considered that highlight the usefulness of using these approaches to compare location and scale.;math.ST

1801.00539;A local systolic-diastolic inequality in contact and symplectic geometry;Let $\Sigma$ be a connected closed three-manifold, and let $t_\Sigma$ be the order of the torsion subgroup of $H_1(\Sigma,\mathbb Z)$. For a contact form $\alpha$ on $\Sigma$, we denote by $\mathrm{Volume}(\alpha)$ the contact volume of $\alpha$, and by $T_{\min}(\alpha)$ and $T_{\max}(\alpha)$ the minimal period and the maximal period of prime periodic orbits of the Reeb flow of $\alpha$ respectively. We say that $\alpha$ is Zoll if its Reeb flow generates a free $S^1$-action on $\Sigma$. We prove that every Zoll contact form $\alpha_*$ on $\Sigma$ admits a $C^3$-neighbourhood $\mathcal U$ in the space of contact forms such that \[ t_\Sigma T_{\min}(\alpha)^2\leq \mathrm{Volume}(\alpha)\leq t_\Sigma T_{\max}(\alpha)^2,\qquad \forall\,\alpha\in\mathcal U, \] and any of the equalities holds if and only if $\alpha$ is Zoll. <br />We extend the above picture to odd-symplectic forms $\Omega$ on $\Sigma$ of arbitrary odd dimension. We define the volume of $\Omega$, which generalises both the contact volume and the Calabi invariant of Hamiltonian functions, and the action of closed characteristics of $\Omega$, which generalises both the period of periodic Reeb orbits and the action of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. We say that $\Omega$ is Zoll if its characteristics are the orbits of a free $S^1$-action on $\Sigma$. We prove that the volume and the action of a Zoll odd-symplectic form satisfy a certain polynomial equation. This builds the equality case of a conjectural local systolic-diastolic inequality for odd-symplectic forms, which we establish in some cases. This inequality recovers the inequality between the minimal action and the Calabi invariant of Hamiltonian isotopies $C^1$-close to the identity on a closed symplectic manifold, as well as the local contact systolic-diastolic inequality above. <br />Finally, applications to magnetic geodesics are discussed.;math.SG
1801.00542;Normal approximations for discrete-time occupancy processes;We study normal approximations for a class of discrete-time occupancy processes, namely, Markov chains with transition kernels of product Bernoulli form. This class encompasses numerous models which appear in the complex networks literature, including stochastic patch occupancy models in ecology, network models in epidemiology, and a variety of dynamic random graph models. Bounds on the rate of convergence for a central limit theorem are obtained using Stein's method and moment inequalities on the deviation from an analogous deterministic model. As a consequence, our work also implies a uniform law of large numbers for a subclass of these processes.;math.PR
1801.00550;Radiality of definable sets;In this article we use techniques developed by Hrushovski-Loeser to study certain metric properties of the Berkovich analytification of a finite morphism of smooth connected projective curves. In recent work, M. Temkin proved a radiality statement for the topological ramification locus associated to such finite morphisms. We generalize this result in two directions. We prove a radiality statement for a more general class of sets which we call definable sets. In another direction, we show that the result of Temkin can be obtained in families.;math.AG
1801.00552;Performance Limits with Additive Error Metrics in Noisy Multi-Measurement Vector Problem;Real-world applications such as magnetic resonance imaging with multiple coils, multi-user communication, and diffuse optical tomography often assume a linear model where several sparse signals sharing common sparse supports are acquired by several measurement matrices and then contaminated by noise. Multi-measurement vector (MMV) problems consider the estimation or reconstruction of such signals. In different applications, the estimation error that we want to minimize could be the mean squared error or other metrics such as the mean absolute error and the support set error. Seeing that minimizing different error metrics is useful in MMV problems, we study information-theoretic performance limits for MMV signal estimation with arbitrary additive error metrics. We also propose a message passing algorithmic framework that achieves the optimal performance, and rigorously prove the optimality of our algorithm for a special case. We further conjecture the optimality of our algorithm for some general cases, and back it up through numerical examples. As an application of our MMV algorithm, we propose a novel setup for active user detection in multi-user communication and demonstrate the promise of our proposed setup.;cs.IT
1801.00556;Uniqueness of solutions for Keller-Segel system of porous medium type coupled to fluid equations;We prove the uniqueness of H\"older continuous weak solutions via duality argument and vanishing viscosity method for the Keller-Segel system of porous medium type equations coupled to the Stokes system in dimensions three. An important step is the estimate of the Green function of parabolic equations with lower order terms of variable coefficients, which seems to be of independent interest.;math.AP
1801.00561;A modified subgradient extragradient method for solving the variational inequality problem;The subgradient extragradient method for solving the variational inequality (VI) problem, which is introduced by Censor et al. \cite{CGR}, replaces the second projection onto the feasible set of the VI, in the extragradient method, with a subgradient projection onto some constructible half-space. Since the method has been introduced, many authors proposed extensions and modifications with applications to various problems. <br />In this paper, we introduce a modified subgradient extragradient method by improving the stepsize of its second step. Convergence of the proposed method is proved under standard and mild conditions and primary numerical experiments illustrate the performance and advantage of this new subgradient extragradient variant.;math.OC
1801.00563;Block Diagonalization Type Precoding Algorithms for IEEE 802.11ac Systems;Block diagonalization (BD) based precoding schemes are well-known linear transmit strategies employed in the downlink of multi-user multiple-input multipleoutput (MU-MIMO) systems. BD type precoding algorithms employed at the transmit side effect the suppression of multi-user interference (MUI) by the decomposition of MU-MIMO broadcast channel into multiple single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO) channels followed by parallelization of the SU-MIMO channels to obtain independent streams of each user. Given that the design of linear precoding algorithms has made significant progress, the implementation of these techniques in standards for wireless local area networks (WLAN) remains an open question. In this work, schemes for implementation of BD based precoding techniques in the framework of IEEE 802.11ac standard are proposed followed by performance evaluation of these techniques in the proposed framework. I analyze the sum-rate and the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the techniques in my framework and obtain computational complexity-wise as well as performance-wise optimal algorithm for my system.;cs.IT
1801.00564;Convergence analysis of the Chebyshev-Legendre spectral method for a class of Fredholm fractional integro-differential equations;In this paper, we propose and analyze a spectral Chebyshev-Legendre approximation for fractional order integro-differential equations of Fredholm type. The fractional derivative is described in the Caputo sense. Our proposed method is illustrated by considering some examples whose exact solutions are available. We prove that the error of the approximate solution decay exponentially in L^2-norm.;math.NA
1801.00570;Periodic solutions for neutral evolution equations with delays;The aim is to study the periodic solution problem for neutral evolution equation <br />$$(u(t)-G(t,u(t-\xi)))'+Au(t)=F(t,u(t),u(t-\tau)),\ \ \ \ t\in\R$$in Banach space $X$, where $A:D(A)\subset X\rightarrow X$ is a closed linear operator, and $-A$ generates a compact analytic operator semigroup $T(t)(t\geq0)$. <br />With the aid of the analytic operator semigroup theories and some fixed point theorems, we obtain the existence and uniqueness of periodic mild solution for neutral evolution equations. The regularity of periodic mild solution for evolution equation with delay is studied, and some the existence results of the classical and strong solutions are obtained. In the end, we give an example to illustrate the applicability of abstract results. Our works greatly improve and generalize the relevant results of existing literatures.;math.FA
1801.00572;Tail empirical process and weighted extreme value index estimator for randomly right-censored data;A tail empirical process for heavy-tailed and right-censored data is introduced and its Gaussian approximation is established. In this context, a (weighted) new Hill-type estimator for positive extreme value index is proposed and its consistency and asymptotic normality are proved by means of the aforementioned process in the framework of second-order conditions of regular variation. In a comparative simulation study, the newly defined estimator is seen to perform better than the already existing ones in terms of both bias and mean squared error. As a real data example, we apply our estimation procedure to evaluate the tail index of the survival time of Australian male Aids patients. It is noteworthy that our approach may also serve to develop other statistics related to the distribution tail such as second-order parameter and reduced-bias tail index estimators. Furthermore, the proposed tail empirical process provides a goodness-of-fit test for Pareto-like models under censorship.;math.ST
1801.00573;Positive periodic solutions for abstract evolution equations with delay;In this paper, we discuss the existence and asymptotic stability of the positive periodic mild solutions for the abstract evolution equation with delay in an ordered Banach space $E$, $$u'(t)+Au(t)=F(t,u(t),u(t-\tau)),\ \ \ \ t\in\R,$$ where $A:D(A)\subset E\rightarrow E$ is a closed linear operator and $-A$ generates a positive $C_{0}$-semigroup $T(t)(t\geq0)$, $F:\R\times E\times E\rightarrow E$ is a continuous mapping which is $\omega$-periodic in $t$. <br />Under order conditions on the nonlinearity $F$ concerning the growth exponent of the semigroup $T(t)(t\geq0)$ or the first eigenvalue of the operator $A$, we obtain the existence and asymptotic stability results of the positive $\omega$-periodic mild solutions by applying operator semigroup theory. In the end, an example is given to illustrate the applicability of our abstract results.;math.FA
1801.00574;Monotone iterative technique for delayed evolution equation periodic problems in Banach spaces;In this paper, we deal with the existence of $\omega$-periodic mild solutions for the abstract evolution equation with delay in an ordered Banach space $E$ $$u'(t)+Au(t)=F(t,u(t),u(t-\tau)),\ \ \ \ t\in\R,$$ where $A:D(A)\subset E\rightarrow E$ is a closed linear operator and $-A$ generates a positive $C_{0}$-semigroup $T(t)(t\geq0)$, $F:\R\times E\times E\rightarrow E$ is a continuous mapping which is $\omega$-periodic in $t$, and $\tau\geq0$ is a constant. Under some weaker assumptions, we construct monotone iterative method for the delayed evolution equation periodic problems, and obtain the existence of maximal and minimal periodic mild solutions. <br />The results obtained generalize the recent conclusions on this topic. Finally, we present two applications to illustrate the feasibility of our abstract results.;math.FA
1801.00575;Existence and Asymptotic Stability of Periodic Solutions for Impulsive Delay Evolution Equations;In this paper, we are devoted to consider the periodic problem for the impulsive evolution equations with delay in Banach space. By using operator semigroups theory and fixed point theorem, we establish some new existence theorems of periodic mild solutions for the equations. In addition, with the aid of an integral inequality with impulsive and delay, we present essential conditions on the nonlinear and impulse functions to guarantee that the equations have an asymptotically stable $\omega$-periodic mild solution.;math.FA
1801.00576;Definably simple stable groups with finitary groups of automorphisms;We prove that infinite definably simple locally finite groups of finite centraliser dimension are simple groups of Lie type over locally finite fields. Then, we identify conditions on automorphisms of a stable group that make it resemble the Frobenius maps, and allow us to classify definably simple stable groups in the specific case when they admit such automorphisms.;math.LO
1801.00577;The variational discretization of the constrained higher-order Lagrange-Poincar&#xe9, equations;In this paper we investigate a variational discretization for the class of mechanical systems in presence of symmetries described by the action of a Lie group which reduces the phase space to a (non-trivial) principal bundle. By introducing a discrete connection we are able to obtain the discrete constrained higher-order Lagrange-Poincar\'e equations. These equations describe the dynamics of a constrained Lagrangian system when the Lagrangian function and the constraints depend on higher-order derivatives such as the acceleration, jerk or jounces. The equations, under some mild regularity conditions, determine a well defined (local) flow which can be used to define a numerical scheme to integrate the constrained higher-order Lagrange-Poincar\'e equations. <br />Optimal control problems for underactuated mechanical systems can be viewed as higher-order constrained variational problems. We study how a variational discretization can be used in the construction of variational integrators for optimal control of underactuated mechanical systems where control inputs act soley on the base manifold of a principal bundle (the shape space). Examples include the energy minimum control of an electron in a magnetic field and two coupled rigid bodies attached at a common center of mass.;math.DS
1801.00578;Non-conforming harmonic virtual element method: $h$- and $p$-versions;We study the $h$- and $p$-versions of non-conforming harmonic virtual element methods (VEM) for the approximation of the Dirichlet-Laplace problem on a 2D polygonal domain, providing quasi-optimal error bounds. Harmonic VEM do not make use of internal degrees of freedom. This leads to a faster convergence, in terms of the number of degrees of freedom, as compared to standard VEM. Importantly, the technical tools used in our $p$-analysis can be employed as well in the analysis of more general non-conforming finite element methods and VEM. The theoretical results are validated in a series of numerical experiments. The $hp$-version of the method is numerically tested, demonstrating exponential convergence with rate given by the square root of the number of degrees of freedom.;math.NA
1801.00580;A formula for the action of Dehn twists on HOMFLY-PT skein modules and its applications;We introduce a formula for the action of Dehn twists on the HOMFLY-PT type skein module of a surface. As an application of the formula to mapping class group, we give an embedding from the Torelli group of a surface $\Sigma_{g,1}$ of genus $g$ with non-empty connected boundary into the completed HOMFLY-PT type skein algebra. As an application of the formula to integral homology $3$-spheres, we construct an invariant $z(M) \in \mathbb{Q} [\rho ] [[h]]$ for an integral homology $3$-sphere $M$. The invariant $z(M) \mod (h^{n+1})$ is a finite type invariant of order $n$.;math.GT
1801.00581;The space of probabilistic 1-lipschitz maps;We introduce and study a natural notion of probabilistic 1-Lipschitz maps. We prove that the space of all probabilistic 1-Lipschitz maps defined on a probabilistic metric space G is also a probabilistic metric space. Moreover, when G is a group, then the space of all prob-abilistic 1-Lipschitz maps defined on G can be endowed with a monoid structure. Then, we caracterize the probabilistic invariant complete Menger groups by the space of all probabilistic 1-Lipschitz maps in the sprit of the classical Banach-Stone theorem.;math.FA
1801.00582;Rankin-Cohen deformations of the algebra of Jacobi forms;The aim of this work is to emphasize the arithmetical and algebraic aspects of the Rankin-Cohen brackets in order to extend them to several natural number-theoretical situations. We build an analytically consistent derivation on the algebra $\widetilde{\mathcal{J}}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$ of weak Jacobi forms. From this derivation, we obtain a sequence of bilinear forms on $\widetilde{\mathcal{J}}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$ that is a formal deformation and whose restriction to the algebra $\mathcal{M}_*$ of modular forms is an analogue of Rankin-Cohen brackets associated to the Serre derivative. Using a classification of all admissible Poisson brackets, we generalize this construction to build a family of Rankin-Cohen deformations of $\widetilde{\mathcal{J}}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$. The algebra $\widetilde{\mathcal{J}}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$ is a polynomial algebra in four generators. We consider some localization $\mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$ of $\widetilde{\mathcal{J}}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$ with respect to one of the generators. We construct Rankin-Cohen deformations on $\mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$. We study their restriction to $\widetilde{\mathcal{J}}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$ and to some subalgebra of $\mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$ naturally isomorphic to the algebra of quasimodular forms.;math.NT
1801.00583;An approximation scheme for semilinear parabolic PDEs with convex and coercive Hamiltonians;We propose an approximation scheme for a class of semilinear parabolic equations that are convex and coercive in their gradients. Such equations arise often in pricing and portfolio management in incomplete markets and, more broadly, are directly connected to the representation of solutions to backward stochastic differential equations. The proposed scheme is based on splitting the equation in two parts, the first corresponding to a linear parabolic equation and the second to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The solutions of these two equations are approximated using, respectively, the Feynman-Kac and the Hopf-Lax formulae. We establish the convergence of the scheme and determine the convergence rate, combining Krylov's shaking coefficients technique and Barles-Jakobsen's optimal switching approximation.;math.OC
1801.00591;Unions of Orthogonal Arrays and their aberrations via Hilbert bases;We generate all the Orthogonal Arrays (OAs) of a given size n and strength t as the union of a collection of OAs which belong to an inclusion-minimal set of OAs. We derive a formula for computing the (Generalized) Word Length Pattern of a union of OAs that makes use of their polynomial counting functions. In this way the best OAs according to the Generalized Minimum Aberration criterion can be found by simply exploring a relatively small set of counting functions. The classes of OAs with 5 binary factors, strength 2, and sizes 16 and 20 are fully described.;math.ST
1801.00606;Secrecy Capacity-Memory Tradeoff of Erasure Broadcast Channels;This paper derives upper and lower bounds on the secrecy capacity-memory tradeoff of a wiretap erasure broadcast channel (BC) with Kw weak receivers and Ks strong receivers, where weak receivers, respectively strong receivers, have same erasure probabilities and cache sizes. The lower bounds are achieved by schemes that meticulously combine joint cache-channel coding with wiretap coding and key-aided one-time pads. The presented upper bound holds more generally for arbitrary degraded BCs and arbitrary cache sizes. When only weak receivers have cache memories, upper and lower bounds coincide for small and large cache memories, thus providing the exact secrecy capacity-memory tradeoff for this setup. The derived bounds allow to further conclude that the secrecy capacity is positive even when the eavesdropper is stronger than all the legitimate receivers with cache memories. Moreover, they show that the secrecy capacity-memory tradeoff can be significantly smaller than its non-secure counterpart, but it grows much faster when cache memories are small. The paper also presents a lower bound on the global secrecy capacity-memory tradeoff where one is allowed to optimize the cache assignment subject to a total cache budget. It is close to the best known lower bound without secrecy constraint. For small total cache budget, the global secrecy capacity-memory tradeoff is achieved by assigning all the available cache memory uniformly over all receivers if the eavesdropper is stronger than all legitimate receivers, and it is achieved by assigning the cache memory uniformly only over the weak receivers if the eavesdropper is weaker than the strong receivers.;cs.IT
1801.00608;On the growth of Lebesgue constants for convex polyhedra;In the paper, new estimates of the Lebesgue constant $$ \mathcal{L}(W)=\frac1{(2\pi)^d}\int_{\mathbb{T}^d}\bigg|\sum_{{k}\in W\cap \mathbb{Z}^d} e^{i({k},\,{x})}\bigg| {\rm d}{ x} $$ for convex polyhedra $W\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ are obtained. The main result states that if $W$ is a convex polyhedron such that $[0,m_1]\times\dots\times [0,m_d]\subset W\subset [0,n_1]\times\dots\times [0,n_d]$, then $$ c(d)\prod_{j=1}^d \log(m_j+1)\le \mathcal{L}(W)\le C(d)s\prod_{j=1}^d \log(n_j+1), $$ where $s$ is a size of the triangulation of $W$.;math.CA
1801.00613;Equivalence between radial solutions of different parabolic gradient-diffusion equations and applications;We consider a general form of a parabolic equation that generalizes both the standard parabolic $p$-Laplace equation and the normalized version that has been proposed in stochastic game theory. We establish an equivalence between this equation and the standard $p$-parabolic equation posed in a fictitious space dimension, valid for radially symmetric solutions. This allows us to find suitable explicit solutions for example of Barenblatt type, and as a consequence we settle the exact asymptotic behaviour of the Cauchy problem even for nonradial data. We also establish the asymptotic behaviour in a bounded domain. Moreover, we use the explicit solutions to establish the parabolic Harnack's inequality.;math.AP
1801.00614;On Bennequin type inequalities for links in tight contact 3-manifolds;We prove that a version of the Thurston-Bennequin inequality holds for Legendrian and transverse links in a rational homology contact 3-sphere $(M,\xi)$, whenever $\xi$ is tight. More specifically, we show that the self-linking number of a transverse link $T$ in $(M,\xi)$, such that the boundary of its tubular neighbourhood consists of incompressible tori, is bounded by the Thurston norm $||T||_T$ of $T$. A similar inequality is given for Legendrian links by using the notions of positive and negative transverse push-off. We apply this bound to compute the tau-invariant for every strongly quasi-positive link in $S^3$. This is done by proving that our inequality is sharp for this family of smooth links. Moreover, we use a stronger Bennequin inequality, for links in the tight 3-sphere, to generalize this result to quasi-positive links and determine their maximal self-linking number.;math.GT
1801.00615;Computational multiscale methods for linear heterogeneous poroelasticity;We consider a strongly heterogeneous medium saturated by an incompressible viscous fluid as it appears in geomechanical modeling. This poroelasticity problem suffers from rapidly oscillating material parameters, which calls for a thorough numerical treatment. In this paper, we propose a method based on the local orthogonal decomposition technique and motivated by a similar approach used for linear thermoelasticity. Therein, local corrector problems are constructed in line with the static equations, whereas we propose to consider the full system. This allows to benefit from the given saddle point structure and results in two decoupled corrector problems for the displacement and the pressure. We prove the optimal first-order convergence of this method and verify the result by numerical experiments.;math.NA
1801.00616;Mixed-Radix Nim;We present take-away games whose Sprague-Grundy functions are given by the Nim sum of heap sizes in a mixed base $\beta$. Let $\Delta_\beta$ be the set of such games. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a minimum of $\Delta_\beta$, and a recursive construction of the maximum of $\Delta_\beta$.;math.CO
1801.00617;Variety of idempotents in nonassociative algebras;In this paper, we study the variety of all nonassociative (NA) algebras from the idempotent point of view. We are interested, in particular, in the spectral properties of idempotents when algebra is generic, i.e. idempotents are in general position. Our main result states that in this case, there exist at least $n-1$ nontrivial obstructions (syzygies) on the Peirce spectrum of a generic NA algebra of dimension $n$. We also discuss the exceptionality of the eigenvalue $\lambda=\frac12$ which appears in the spectrum of idempotents in many classical examples of NA algebras and characterize its extremal properties in metrised algebras.;math.RA
1801.00618;Input to State Stability of Bipedal Walking Robots: Application to DURUS;Bipedal robots are a prime example of systems which exhibit highly nonlinear dynamics, underactuation, and undergo complex dissipative impacts. This paper discusses methods used to overcome a wide variety of uncertainties, with the end result being stable bipedal walking. The principal contribution of this paper is to establish sufficiency conditions for yielding input to state stable (ISS) hybrid periodic orbits, i.e., stable walking gaits under model-based and phase-based uncertainties. In particular, it will be shown formally that exponential input to state stabilization (e-ISS) of the continuous dynamics, and hybrid invariance conditions are enough to realize stable walking in the 23-DOF bipedal robot DURUS. This main result will be supported through successful and sustained walking of the bipedal robot DURUS in a laboratory environment.;math.OC
1801.00621;FKG (and other inequalities) via (generalized) FK representation (and iterated folding);In this paper we prove several inequalities by means of diagrammatic expansions, a technique already used in [BG13]. This time we show that iterations of the folding of a probability leads to the proof of some in- equalities by means of a generalized random cluster representation of the iterated foldings. One of the inequalities is the well known FKG inequal- ity, which ends up being proven, quite unexpectedly, by means of the (generalized) FK representation. Although most of the results are not new, we hope that the techniques will find applications in other contexts.;math.PR
1801.00623;Observability of Boolean Networks via Set Controllability Approach;The controllability and observability of Boolean control network(BCN) are two fundamental properties. But the verification of latter is much harder than the former. This paper considers the observability of BCN via controllability. First, the set controllability is proposed, and the necessary and sufficient condition is obtained. Then a technique is developed to convert the observability into an equivalent set controllability problem. Using the result for set controllability, the necessary and sufficient condition is also obtained for the observability of BCN.;math.OC
1801.00624;Homology of Lie Algebras of Orthogonal and Symplectic Generalized Jacobi Matrices;In this note, we compute the homology with trivial coefficients of Lie algebras of generalized Jacobi matrices of type $B, C$ and $D$ over an associative unital $k$-algebra with $k$ being a field of characteristic $0$.;math.RT
1801.00627;Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse games on a class of scattered linear orders;Two structures $A$ and $B$ are $n$-equivalent if player II has a winning strategy in the $n$-move Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e game on $A$ and $B$. In earlier papers we studied $n$-equivalence classes of ordinals and coloured ordinals. In this paper we similarly treat a class of scattered order-types, focussing on monomials and sums of monomials in $\omega$ and its reverse $\omega^*$.;math.LO
1801.00628;Deformation of the $&#x3c3,_2$-curvature;Our main goal in this work is to deal with results concern to the $\sigma_2$-curvature. First we find a symmetric 2-tensor canonically associated to the $\sigma_2$-curvature and we present an Almost Schur Type Lemma. Using this tensor we introduce the notion of $\sigma_2$-singular space and under a certain hypothesis we prove a rigidity result. Also we deal with the relations between flat metrics and $\sigma_2$-curvature. With a suitable condition on the $\sigma_2$-curvature we show that a metric has to be flat if it is close to a flat metric. We conclude this paper by proving that the 3-dimensional torus does not admit a metric with constant scalar curvature and non-negative $\sigma_2$-curvature unless it is flat.;math.DG
1801.00629;$H^2$--Convergence of least-squares kernel collocation methods;The strong-form asymmetric kernel-based collocation method, commonly referred to as the Kansa method, is easy to implement and hence is widely used for solving engineering problems and partial differential equations despite the lack of theoretical support. The simple least-squares (LS) formulation, on the other hand, makes the study of its solvability and convergence rather nontrivial. In this paper, we focus on general second order linear elliptic differential equations in $\Omega \subset R^d$ under Dirichlet boundary conditions. With kernels that reproduce $H^m(\Omega)$ and some smoothness assumptions on the solution, we provide denseness conditions for a constrained least-squares method and a class of weighted least-squares algorithms to be convergent. Theoretically, we identify some $H^2(\Omega)$ convergent LS formulations that have an optimal error behavior like $h^{m-2}$. We also demonstrate the effects of various collocation settings on the respective convergence rates, as well as how these formulations perform with high order kernels and when coupled with the stable evaluation technique for the Gaussian kernel.;math.NA
1801.00630;A nonstandard invariant of coarse spaces;We construct a set-valued invariant $\iota\left(X,\xi\right)$ of pointed coarse spaces $\left(X,\xi\right)$ by using nonstandard analysis. The invariance under coarse equivalence is established. A sufficient condition for the invariant to be of cardinality $\leq1$ is provided. Miller et al. and subsequent researchers have introduced a similar but standard set-valued coarse invariant $\sigma\left(X,\xi\right)$ of pointed metric spaces $\left(X,\xi\right)$. In order to compare these two invariants, we construct a natural transformation $\omega_{\left(X,\xi\right)}$ from $\sigma\left(X,\xi\right)$ to $\iota\left(X,\xi\right)$. The surjectivity of $\omega_{\left(X,\xi\right)}$ is proved for all proper geodesic spaces $\left(X,\xi\right)$.;math.GN
1801.00633;On semilinear elliptic equations with diffuse measures;We consider semilinear equation of the form $-Lu=f(x,u)+\mu$, where $L$ is the operator corresponding to a transient symmetric regular Dirichlet form ${\mathcal E}$, $\mu$ is a diffuse measure with respect to the capacity associated with ${\mathcal E}$, and the lower-order perturbing term $f(x,u)$ satisfies the sign condition in $u$ and some weak integrability condition (no growth condition on $f(x,u)$ as a function of $u$ is imposed). We prove the existence of a solution under mild additional assumptions on ${\mathcal E}$. We also show that the solution is unique if $f$ is nonincreasing in $u$.;math.AP
1801.00638;Distinguishing pure representations by normalized traces;Given two pure representations of the absolute Galois group of an $\ell$-adic number field with coefficients in $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_p$ (with $\ell\neq p$), we show that the Frobenius-semisimplifications of the associated Weil--Deligne representations are twists of each other by an integral power of certain unramified character if they have equal normalized traces. This is an analogue of a recent result of Patankar and Rajan in the context of local Galois representations.;math.NT
1801.00647;Distributed Control and Stabilization for Discrete-time Large Scale Systems With Imposed Constraints;This paper is concerned with the distributed control and stabilization problems for linear discrete-time large scale systems with imposed constraints. The main contributions of this paper are: Firstly, by using the maximum principle (necessary condition) for the finite horizon optimal control developed in this paper, the optimal distributed controller is thus derived, which can be easily calculated, Secondly, by defining the Lyapunov function with the optimal cost function, we show that the systems with imposed constraints can be stabilized by the optimal distributed controller for the infinite horizon case. The main techniques adopted in this paper are the maximum principle and the solution to the forward and backward difference equations (FBDE), which are the basis in solving distributed control and stabilization problems for linear systems with constraints.;math.OC
1801.00653;Rings which are Essential over their Centers, II;A ring $R$ with center $C$ is said to be\textit{centrally essential} if the module $R_C$ is an essential extension of the module $C_C$. We describe centrally essential exterior algebras of finitely generated free modules over not necessary commutative rings and study properties of semi-Artinian centrally essential rings.

1801.00654;Simple supermodules over Lie superalgebras;We show that, for many Lie superalgebras admitting a compatible $\mathbb{Z}$-grading, Kac induction functor gives rise to a bijection between simple supermodules over a Lie superalgebra and simple supermodules over the even part of this Lie superalgebra. This reduces the classification problem for the former to the one for the latter. Our result applies to all classical Lie superalgebra of type $I$, in particular, to the general linear Lie superalgebra $\gl(m|n)$. In the latter case we also show that the rough structure of simple $\gl(m|n)$-supermodules and also that of Kac supermodules depends only on the annihilator of the $\mf{gl}(m)\oplus \mf{gl}(n)$-input and hence can be computed using the combinatorics of BGG category $\mathcal{O}$.;math.RT
1801.00655;Contractibility of the Space of Opers for Classical Groups;The geometric Langlands program is an exciting direction of research, although a lot of progress has been made there are still open questions and gaps. One of the necessary steps for this program is the proof of the existence and the cohomological triviality (more precisely, the O- contractibility) of the space of rational opers. In this paper, we prove the homotopical contractibility of the space of rational opers for classical groups.;math.RT
1801.00656;On the constant scalar curvature K&#xe4,hler metrics, existence results;In this paper, we generalize our apriori estimates on cscK(constant scalar curvature K\"ahler) metric equation to more general scalar curvature type equations (e.g., twisted cscK metric equation). As applications, under the assumption that the automorphism group is discrete, we prove the celebrated Donaldson's conjecture that the non-existence of cscK metric is equivalent to the existence of a destabilized geodesic ray where the $K$-energy is non-increasing. Moreover, we prove that the properness of $K$-energy in terms of $L^1$ geodesic distance $d_1$ in the space of K\"ahler potentials implies the existence of cscK metric. Finally, we prove that weak minimizers of the $K$-energy in $(\mathcal{E}^1, d_1)$ are smooth.;math.DG
1801.00657;The $p$-adic Lambert $W$ function;In this paper we introduce the $p$-adic analogue of the Lambert $W$ function, and study its main properties.;math.CA
1801.00661;Heat kernels of non-symmetric jump processes with exponentially decaying jumping kernel;In this paper we study the transition densities for a large class of non-symmetric Markov processes whose jumping kernels decay exponentially or subexponentially. We obtain their upper bounds which also decay at the same rate as their jumping kernels. When the lower bounds of jumping kernels satisfy the weak upper scaling condition at zero, we also establish lower bounds for the transition densities, which are sharp.;math.PR
1801.00663;A Sharp Estimate for Probability Distributions;We consider absolutely continuous probability distributions $f(x)dx$ on $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$. A result of Feldheim and Feldheim shows, among other things, that if the distribution is not compactly supported, then there exist $z &gt, 0$ such that most events in $\left\{X + Y \geq 2z\right\}$ are comprised of a 'small' term satisfying $\min(X,Y) \leq z$ and a 'large' term satisfying $\max(X,Y) \geq z$ (as opposed to two 'large' terms that are both larger than $z$) $$ \limsup_{z \rightarrow \infty}~ \mathbb{P}\left( \min(X,Y) \leq z | X+Y \geq 2z\right) = 1.$$ The result fails if the distribution is compactly supported. We prove $$\sup_{z &gt, 0 } ~\mathbb{P}\left( \min(X,Y) \leq z | X+Y \geq 2z\right) \geq \frac{1}{24 + 8\log_2{( med(X) \|f\|_{L^{\infty}})}},$$ where $med(X)$ denotes the median. Interestingly, the logarithm is necessary and the result is sharp up to constants, we also discuss some open problems.;math.PR
1801.00670;Low-Rank Matrix Approximations Do Not Need a Singular Value Gap;This is a systematic investigation into the sensitivity of low-rank approximations of real matrices. We show that the low-rank approximation errors, in the two-norm, Frobenius norm and more generally, any Schatten p-norm, are insensitive to additive rank-preserving perturbations in the projector basis, and to matrix perturbations that are additive or change the number of columns (including multiplicative perturbations). Thus, low-rank matrix approximations are always well-posed and do not require a singular value gap. In the presence of a singular value gap, connections are established between low-rank approximations and subspace angles.;math.NA
1801.00673;CutIGA with Basis Function Removal;We consider a cut isogeometric method, where the boundary of the domain is allowed to cut through the background mesh in an arbitrary fashion for a second order elliptic model problem. In order to stabilize the method on the cut boundary we remove basis functions which have small intersection with the computational domain. We determine criteria on the intersection which guarantee that the order of convergence in the energy norm is not affected by the removal. The higher order regularity of the B-spline basis functions leads to improved bounds compared to standard Lagrange elements.;math.NA
1801.00682;A Probabilistic Subspace Bound with Application to Active Subspaces;Given a real symmetric positive semi-definite matrix E, and an approximation S that is a sum of n independent matrix-valued random variables, we present bounds on the relative error in S due to randomization. The bounds do not depend on the matrix dimensions but only on the numerical rank (intrinsic dimension) of E. Our approach resembles the low-rank approximation of kernel matrices from random features, but our accuracy measures are more stringent. <br />In the context of parameter selection based on active subspaces, where S is computed via Monte Carlo sampling, we present a bound on the number of samples so that with high probability the angle between the dominant subspaces of E and S is less than a user-specified tolerance. This is a substantial improvement over existing work, as it is a non-asymptotic and fully explicit bound on the sampling amount n, and it allows the user to tune the success probability. It also suggests that Monte Carlo sampling can be efficient in the presence of many parameters, as long as the underlying function f is sufficiently smooth.;math.NA
1801.00683;The sequential loss of allelic diversity;This paper gives a new flavor of what Peter Jagers and his co-authors call `the path to extinction'. In a neutral population with constant size $N$, we assume that each individual at time $0$ carries a distinct type, or allele. We consider the joint dynamics of these $N$ alleles, for example the dynamics of their respective frequencies and more plainly the nonincreasing process counting the number of alleles remaining by time $t$. We call this process the extinction process. We show that in the Moran model, the extinction process is distributed as the process counting (in backward time) the number of common ancestors to the whole population, also known as the block counting process of the $N$-Kingman coalescent. Stimulated by this result, we investigate: (1) whether it extends to an identity between the frequencies of blocks in the Kingman coalescent and the frequencies of alleles in the extinction process, both evaluated at jump times, (2) whether it extends to the general case of $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot processes.;math.PR
1801.00684;Risk minimization in life-cycle oil production optimization;The geology of oil reservoirs is largely unknown. Consequently, the reservoir models used for production optimization are subject to significant uncertainty. To minimize the associated risk, the oil literature has mainly used ensemble-based methods to optimize sample estimated risk measures of net present value (NPV). However, the success in reducing risk critically depends on the choice of risk measure. As a systematic approach to risk mitigation in production optimization, this paper characterizes proper risk measures by the axioms of coherence and aversion. As an example of a proper measure, we consider conditional value-at-risk, $\text{CVaR}_{\alpha}$, at different risk levels, $\alpha$. The potential of $\text{CVaR}_{\alpha}$ to minimize profit loss is demonstrated by a simulated case study. The case study compares $\text{CVaR}_{\alpha}$ to real-world best practices, represented by reactive control. It shows that for any risk level, $\alpha$, we may find an optimized strategy that provides lower risk than reactive control. However, despite overall lower risk, we see that all optimized strategies still yield some unacceptable low profit realizations relative to reactive control. To remedy this, we introduce a risk mitigation method based on the NPV offset distribution. Unlike existing methods of the oil literature, the offset risk mitigation approach minimizes the risk relative to a reference strategy representing common real-life practices, e.g. reactive control. In the simulated case study, we minimize the worst case profit offset to reduce the risk of realizations that do worse than the reactive strategy. The results suggest that it may be more relevant to consider the NPV offset distribution than the NPV distribution when minimizing risk in production optimization.;math.OC
1801.00691;Energy-enstrophy conserving compatible finite element schemes for the rotating shallow water equations with slip boundary conditions;We describe an energy-enstrophy conserving discretisation for the rotating shallow water equations with slip boundary conditions. This relaxes the assumption of boundary-free domains (periodic solutions or the surface of a sphere, for example) in the energy-enstrophy conserving formulation of McRae and Cotter (2014). This discretisation requires extra prognostic vorticity variables on the boundary in addition to the prognostic velocity and layer depth variables. The energy-enstrophy conservation properties hold for any appropriate set of compatible finite element spaces defined on arbitrary meshes with arbitrary boundaries. We demonstrate the conservation properties of the scheme with numerical solutions on a rotating hemisphere.;math.NA
1801.00696;On pairs of interacting electrons in a quantum wire;In this paper we consider pairs of interacting electrons moving in a simple quantum wire, namely the half-line. In particular, we extend the results obtained in [<a href="/abs/1708.03753">arXiv:1708.03753</a>] by allowing for contact interactions of the Lieb-Liniger type between the two electrons constituting the pair. We construct the associated Hamiltonian rigorously and study its spectral properties. We then investigate Bose-Einstein condensation of pairs and prove, as a main result, the existence of condensation whenever the Hamiltonian has a non-trivial discrete spectrum. Most importantly, condensation is proved for very weak and very strong contact interactions.;math-ph
1801.00699;Sandwich classification for $O_{2n+1}(R)$ and $U_{2n+1}(R,&#x394,)$ revisited;In a recent paper, the author proved that if $n\geq 3$ is a natural number, $R$ a commutative ring and $\sigma\in GL_n(R)$, then $t_{kl}(\sigma_{ij})$ where $i\neq j$ and $k\neq l$ can be expressed as a product of $8$ matrices of the form $^{\epsilon}\sigma^{\pm 1}$ where $\epsilon\in E_n(R)$. In this article we prove similar results for the odd-dimensional orthogonal groups $O_{2n+1}(R)$ and the odd-dimensional unitary groups $U_{2n+1}(R,\Delta)$ under the assumption that $R$ is commutative and $n\geq 3$. This yields new, short proofs of the Sandwich Classification Theorems for the groups $O_{2n+1}(R)$ and $U_{2n+1}(R,\Delta)$.;math.KT
1801.00700;Nests, and their Role in the Orderability Problem;This chapter is divided into two parts. The first part is a survey of some recent results on nests and the orderability problem. The second part consists of results, partial results and open questions, all viewed in the light of nests. From connected LOTS, to products of LOTS and function spaces, up to an order relation in the Fermat Real Line.;math.GN
1801.00706;A new representation of Hankel operators and its spectral consequences;We describe a new representation of Hankel operators $H$ as pseudo-differential operators $A$ in the space of functions defined on the whole axis. The amplitudes of such operators $A$ have a very special structure: they are products of functions of a one variable only. This representation has numerous spectral consequences both for compact Hankel operators and for operators with the continuous spectrum.;math.SP
1801.00709;Cluster algebras arising from cluster tubes I: integer vectors;We study cluster algebras arising from cluster tubes. We obtain categorical interpretations for $g$-vectors, $c$-vectors and denominator vectors for cluster algebras of type $\mathrm{C}$ with respect to arbitrary initial seeds. In particular, a denominator theorem has been proved, which enables us to establish the linearly independence of denominator vectors of cluster variables from the same cluster for cluster algebras of type $\mathrm{A}\mathrm{B}\mathrm{C}$. This strengthens the link between cluster tubes and cluster algebras of type $\mathrm{C}$ initiated by Buan, Marsh and Vatne.;math.RA
1801.00714;Exact Exponent for Soft Covering;This work establishes the exact exponents for the soft-covering phenomenon of a memoryless channel under the total variation metric when random (i.i.d. and constant-composition) channel codes are used. The exponents, established herein, are strict improvements in both directions on bounds found in the literature. This complements the recent literature establishing the exact exponents under the relative entropy metric, however, the proof techniques have significant differences, and thus, neither result trivially implies the other. <br />The found exponents imply new and improved bounds for various problems that use soft-covering as their achievability argument, including new lower bounds for the resolvability exponent and the secrecy exponent in the wiretap channel.;cs.IT
1801.00721;A crossing lemma for multigraphs;Let $G$ be a drawing of a graph with $n$ vertices and $e&gt,4n$ edges, in which no two adjacent edges cross and any pair of independent edges cross at most once. According to the celebrated Crossing Lemma of Ajtai, Chv\'atal, Newborn, Szemer\'edi and Leighton, the number of crossings in $G$ is at least $c{e^3\over n^2}$, for a suitable constant $c&gt,0$. In a seminal paper, Sz\'ekely generalized this result to multigraphs, establishing the lower bound $c{e^3\over mn^2}$, where $m$ denotes the maximum multiplicity of an edge in $G$. We get rid of the dependence on $m$ by showing that, as in the original Crossing Lemma, the number of crossings is at least $c'{e^3\over n^2}$ for some $c'&gt,0$, provided that the "lens" enclosed by every pair of parallel edges in $G$ contains at least one vertex. This settles a conjecture of Kaufmann.;math.CO
1801.00722;Bases for Kumjian-Pask algebras over standard $k$-graphs;For any Kumjian-Pask algebra $KP_R(\Lambda)$ defined over a $k$-graph $\Lambda$ of a special kind (a "standard $k$-graph"), we obtain an $R$-basis.;math.KT
1801.00724;Subdifferential formulae for the supremum of an arbitrary family of functions;This work provides calculus for the Fr\'echet and limiting subdifferential of the pointwise supremum given by an arbitrary family of lower semicontinuous functions. We start our study showing fuzzy results about the Fr\'echet subdifferential of the supremum function. Posteriorly, we study in finite- and infinite-dimensional settings the limiting subdifferential of the supremum function. Finally, we apply our results to the study of the convex subdifferential, here we recover general formulae for the subdifferential of an arbitrary family of convex functions.;math.OC
1801.00726;Forcing Brushes;We give short and simple proofs of the inequalities $B(G)\leq Z(L(G))$ and $Z(G)\leq Z(L(G))$ first established by Erzurumluo\u{g}lu, Meagher, and Pike, where $G$ is a graph without isolated vertices, $B(G)$ is the brushing number of $G$, $Z(G)$ is the zero forcing number of $G$, and $L(G)$ is the line graph of $G$.;math.CO
1801.00728;Integration of quadratic Lie algebroids to Riemannian Cartan-Lie groupoids;Cartan-Lie algebroids, i.e. Lie algebroids equipped with a compatible connection, permit the definition of an adjoint representation, on the fiber as well as on the tangent of the base. We call (positive) quadratic Lie algebroids, Cartan-Lie algebroids with ad-invariant (Riemannian) metrics on their fibers and base $\kappa$ and $g$, respectively. We determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for a positive quadratic Lie algebroid to integrate to a Riemmanian Cartan-Lie groupoid. Here we mean a Cartan-Lie groupoid $\mathcal{G}$ equipped with a bi-invariant and inversion invariant metric $\eta$ on $T\mathcal{G}$ such that it induces by submersion the metric $g$ on its base and its restriction to the $t$-fibers coincides with $\kappa$.;math.DG
1801.00733;The bicanonical map of the Cartwright-Steger surface;We prove that the bicanonical map of the Cartwright-Steger surface is an embedding. We also discuss two minimal surfaces of general type, both covered by the Cartwright-Steger surface. One has $K^2=2$, $p_g=1$, $\pi_1=\{1\}$ and the other has $K^2=1$, $p_g=0$, $\pi_1=\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$.;math.AG
1801.00735;Filtered finiteness of the image of the unstable Hurewicz homomorphism with applications to bordism of immersions;After recent work of Hill, Hopkins, and Ravenel on the Kervaire invariant one problem, as well as Adams' solution of the Hopf invariant one problem, an immediate consequence of Curtis conjecture is that the set of spherical classes in $H_*Q_0S^0$ is finite. Similarly, Eccles conjecture, when specialised to $X=S^n$ with $n&gt,0$, together with Adams' Hopf invariant one theorem, implies that the set of spherical classes in $H_*QS^n$ is finite. We prove a filtered version of the above the finiteness properties. We show that if $X$ is an arbitrary $CW$-complex such that $H_*X$ is finite dimensional then the image of the composition ${_2\pi_*}\Omega^l\Sigma^{l+2}X\to{_2\pi_*}Q\Sigma^2X\to H_*Q\Sigma^2X$ is finite, the finiteness remains valid if we formally replace $X$ with $S^{-1}$. As an immediate and interesting application, we observe that for any compact Lie group $G$ with $\dim\mathfrak{g}&gt,1$ and for any $n&gt,0$ the image of the composition ${_2\pi_*}Q\Sigma^{\dim\mathfrak{g}}BG_+^{[n]}\to{_2\pi_*}Q\Sigma^{\dim\mathfrak{g}}BG_+\to {_2\pi_*}Q_0S^0\to H_*Q_0S^0$ is finite where $\Sigma^{\dim\mathfrak{g}}BG_+\to S^0$ is a suitably twisted transfer map. Next, we consider work of Koschorke and Sanderson which using Thom-Pontrjagin construction provides a $1$-$1$ correspondence (a group isomorphism if $m+d&gt,0$) $\Phi^{N,\xi}_{m,d}: \mathrm{Imm}_\xi^d(\mathbb{R}^m\times N) \longrightarrow [N_+,\Omega^{m+d}\Sigma^dT(\xi)]$. We apply work of Asadi and Eccles on computing Stiefel-Whitney numbers of immersions to show that given a framed immersion $M\to\mathbb{R}^{n+k}$ and choosing $n$ very large with respect to $d$ and $k$, all self-intersection manifolds of an arbitrary element of $\mathrm{Imm}_\xi^d(\mathbb{R}^m\times N)$ are boundary.;math.AT
1801.00737;Even cycle creating paths;We say that two graphs $H_1,H_2$ on the same vertex set are $G$-creating ($G$-different in other papers, this difference is explained in the introduction) if the union of the two graphs contains $G$ as a subgraph. Let $H(n,k)$ be the maximal number of pairwise $C_k$-creating paths (of arbitrary length) on $n$ vertices. The behaviour of $H(n,2k+1)$ is much better understood than the behaviour of $H(n,2k)$, the former is an exponential function of $n$ while the latter is larger than exponential, for every fixed $k$. We study $H(n,k)$ for fixed $k$ and $n$ tending to infinity. The only non trivial upper bound on $H(n,2k)$ was in the case where $k=2$ $$H(n,4)\leq n^{\left(1-\frac{1}{4} \right) n-o(n)}, $$ this was proved by Cohen, Fachini and K\"orner. In this paper, we generalize their method to prove that for every $k \geq 2$, <br />$$H(n,2k) \leq n^{\left( 1- \frac{2}{3k^2-2k} \right)n-o(n)}. $$ Our proof uses constructions of bipartite, regular, $C_{2k}$-free graphs with many edges by Reiman, Benson, Lazebnik, Ustimenko and Woldar. For some special values of $k$ we can have slightly denser such bipartite graphs than for general $k$, this results in having better upper bounds on $H(n,2k)$ than stated above for these special values of $k$.;math.CO
1801.00739;Log canonical pairs over varieties with maximal Albanese dimension;Let $(X,B)$ be a log canonical pair over a normal variety $Z$ with maximal Albanese dimension. If $K_X+B$ is relatively abundant over $Z$ (for example, $K_X+B$ is relatively big over $Z$), then we prove that $K_X+B$ is abundant. In particular, the subadditvity of Kodaira dimensions $\kappa(K_X+B) \geq \kappa(K_F+B_F)+ \kappa(Z)$ holds, where $F$ is a general fiber, $K_F+B_F= (K_X+B)|_F$, and $\kappa(Z)$ means the Kodaira dimension of a smooth model of $Z$. We discuss several variants of this result in Section 4. We also give a remark on the log Iitaka conjecture for log canonical pairs in Section 5.;math.AG
1801.00741;Mixed Boundary Value Problems for non-Divergence Type Elliptic Equations in Unbounded Domain;We investigate the qualitative properties of solution to the Zaremba type problem in unbounded domain for the non-divergence elliptic equation with possible degeneration at infinity. The main result is Phragm\'en-Lindel\"of type principle on growth/decay of a solution at infinity depending on both the structure of the Neumann portion of the boundary and the "thickness" of its Dirichlet portion. The result is formulated in terms of so-called $s$-capacity of the Dirichlet portion of the boundary, while the Neumann boundary should satisfy certain "admissibility" condition in the sequence of layers converging to infinity.;math.AP
1801.00749;Simplicial faces of the set of correlation matrices;This paper concerns the facial geometry of the set of $n \times n$ correlation matrices. The main result states that almost every set of $r$ vertices generates a simplicial face, provided that $r \leq \sqrt{\mathrm{c} n}$, where $\mathrm{c}$ is an absolute constant. This bound is qualitatively sharp because the set of correlation matrices has no simplicial face generated by more than $\sqrt{2n}$ vertices.;math.MG
1801.00754;Fundamental Latency Limits for D2D-Aided Content Delivery in Fog Wireless Networks;Device-to-Device (D2D) communication can support the operation of cellular systems by reducing the traffic in the network infrastructure. In this paper, the benefits of D2D communication are investigated in the context of a Fog-Radio Access Network (F-RAN) that leverages edge caching and fronthaul connectivity for the purpose of content delivery. Assuming offline caching, out-of-band D2D communication, and an F-RAN with two edge nodes and two user equipments, an information-theoretically optimal caching and delivery strategy is presented that minimizes the delivery time in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. The delivery time accounts for the latency caused by fronthaul, downlink, and D2D transmissions. The proposed optimal strategy is based on a novel scheme for an X-channel with receiver cooperation that leverages tools from real interference alignment. Insights are provided on the regimes in which D2D communication is beneficial.;cs.IT
1801.00757;The second Weyl coefficient for a first order system;For a scalar elliptic self-adjoint operator on a compact manifold without boundary we have two-term asymptotics for the number of eigenvalues between zero and lambda when lambda tends to infinity, under an additional dynamical condition. This is a well known result of J.J.Duistermaat and V.W.Guillemin from 1975. <br />In the case of an elliptic system of first order, the existence of two-term asymptotics was also established quite early and as in the scalar case Fourier integral operators have been the crucial tool. The complete computation of the coefficient of the second term was obtained only in 2013. In the present paper we simplify that calculation. The main observation is that with the existence of two-term asymptotics already established, it suffices to study the resolvent as a pseudodifferential operator in order to identify and compute the second coefficient.;math.SP
1801.00760;The cover time of a biased random walk on a random cubic graph;We study a random walk that prefers tou se unvisited edges in the context of random cubic graphs. We establish asymptotically correct estimates for the vertex and edge cover times, these being $\approx n\log n$ and $\approx \frac32n\log n$ respectively.;math.CO
1801.00761;Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with singular drifts: integral estimates and Girsanov densities;We consider a perturbation of a Hilbert space-valued Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process by a class of singular nonlinear non-autonomous maximal monotone time-dependent drifts. The only further assumption on the drift is that it is bounded on balls in the Hilbert space uniformly in time. First we introduce a new notion of generalized solutions for such equations which we call pseudo-weak solutions and prove that they always exist and obtain pathwise estimates in terms of the data of the equation. Then we prove that their laws are absolutely continuous with respect to the law of the original Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process. In particular, we show that pseudo-weak solutions always have continuous sample paths. In addition, we obtain integrability estimates of the associated Girsanov densities. Some of our results concern non-random equations as well, while probabilistic results are new even in finite-dimensional autonomous settings.;math.PR
1801.00763;Koszul almost complete intersections;Let $R = S/I$ be a quotient of a standard graded polynomial ring $S$ by an ideal $I$ generated by quadrics. If $R$ is Koszul, a question of Avramov, Conca, and Iyengar asks whether the Betti numbers of $R$ over $S$ can be bounded above by binomial coefficients on the minimal number of generators of $I$. Motivated by previous results for Koszul algebras defined by three quadrics, we give a complete classification of the structure of Koszul almost complete intersections and, in the process, give an affirmative answer to the above question for all such rings.;math.AC
1801.00767;The local-triviality dimension of actions of compact quantum groups;We define the local-triviality dimension for actions of compact quantum groups on unital C*-algebras. The resulting compact quantum principal bundle is said to be locally trivial when this dimension is finite. For commutative C*-algebras, this notion recovers the standard definition of local triviality of compact principal bundles. We prove that actions with finite local-triviality dimension are automatically free. Then we apply this new notion to prove the noncommutative Borsuk-Ulam-type conjecture under the assumption that a compact quantum group admits a non-trivial classical subgroup whose induced action has finite local-triviality dimension. This is a noncommutative extension of the Borsuk-Ulam-type theorem for locally trivial principal bundles.;math.OA
1801.00770;The set of non-uniquely ergodic d-IETs has Hausdorff codimension 1/2;We show that the set of not uniquely ergodic d-IETs has Hausdorff dimension d-3/2 (in the (d-1)-dimension space of d-IETs) for d&gt,4. For d=4 this was shown by Athreya-Chaika and for d=2,3 the set is known to have dimension d-2.;math.DS
1801.00771;A note on logarithmic growth of solutions of $p$-adic differential equations without solvability;For a $p$-adic differential equation solvable in an open disc (in a $p$-adic sense), around 1970, Dwork proves that the solutions satisfy a certain growth condition on the boundary. Dwork also conjectures that a similar phenomenon should be observed without assuming the solvability. In this paper, we verify Dwork's conjecture in the rank two case, which is the first non-trivial result on the conjecture. The proof is an application of Kedlaya's decomposition theorem of $p$-adic differential equations defined over annulus.;math.NT
1801.00780;A Mathematical Analysis of Dirac Equation Physics;The paper analyzes time propagation of Dirac observables - using Heisenberg representation - in the light of various pseudodifferential operator algebras (cf. [Co3], [Co15], [Co16]). Our theory gives (i) a mechanical angular momentum (the spin), but also (ii) another real 3-vector, travelling with the particle, with magnetic properties (its motion guided by the magnetic field around it, but not in the proper relativistic way). The above is discussed for potentials vanishing at infinity. But we also look at a Dirac particle in the field of a plane polarized X-ray wave, trying to analyze the Compton effect. The propagations of energy and momentum (in the X-ray's direction) are coupled - they allow a joint asymptotic expansion with terms representing change of energy by $nh\nu$ and momentum by $nh\nu/c$, with n=0,1,2, ..., valid for large frequencies, i.e., large momentum coordinates. Possible interpretation: A collision of the electron-positron with 0, 1, 2, ... n Photons of energy $h\nu$, affecting a change of energy-momentum. Note, this does not require QFT.;math-ph
1801.00781;Gibbs measures of an Ising model with competing interactions on the triangular chandelier-lattice;In this paper, we consider an Ising model with three competing interactions on a triangular chandelier-lattice (TCL). We describe the existence, uniqueness, and non-uniqueness of translation-invariant Gibbs measures associated with the Ising model. We obtain an explicit formula for Gibbs measures with a memory of length 2 satisfying consistency conditions. It is rigorously proved that the model exhibits phase transitions only for given values of the coupling constants. As a consequence of our approach, the dichotomy between alternative solutions of Hamiltonian models on TCLs is solved. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.;math-ph
1801.00782;Trapezoidal type inequalities related to h-convex functions with applications;A mapping M(t) is considered to obtain some preliminary results and a new trapezoidal form of Fejer inequality related to the h-convex functions. Furthermore the obtained results are applied to achieve some new inequalities in connection with special means, random variable and trapezoidal formula.;math.FA
1801.00784;Expansion of Iterated Stratonovich Stochastic Integrals of Arbitrary Multiplicity Based on Generalized Iterated Fourier Series Converging Pointwise;The article is devoted to the expansion of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of arbitrary multiplicity $k$ $(k\in\mathbb{N})$ based on the generalized iterated Fourier series converging pointwise. The case of Fourier-Legendre series as well as the case of trigonometric Fourier series are considered in details. The obtained expansion provides a possibility to represent the iterated Stratonovich stochastic integral in the form of iterated series of products of standard Gaussian random variables. Convergence in the mean of degree $2n$ $(n\in \mathbb{N})$ of the expansion is proved. Some modifications of the mentioned expansion were derived for the case $k=2$. One of them is based of multiple trigonometric Fourier series converging almost everywhere in the square $[t, T]^2$. The results of the article can be applied to the numerical solution of Ito stochastic differential equations.;math.PR
1801.00785;Geometric presentation for the cohomology ring of polygon spaces;We describe the cohomology ring of the moduli space of a flexible polygon in geometrically meaningful terms. We propose two presentations, both are computation friendly: there are simple rules for cup product.;math.GT
1801.00803;On full Zakharov equation and its approximations;We study the solvability of the Zakharov equation $$\Delta^2 u + (\kappa-\omega^2)\Delta u - \kappa \,\text{div} \left(e^{-|\nabla u|^2} \nabla u\right) = 0$$ in a bounded domain under homogeneous Dirichlet or Navier boundary conditions. This problem is a consequence of the system of equations derived by Zakharov to model the Langmuir collapse in plasma physics. Assumptions for the existence and nonexistence of a ground state solution as well as the multiplicity of solutions are discussed. Moreover, we consider formal approximations of the Zakharov equation obtained by the Taylor expansion of the exponential term. We illustrate that the existence and nonexistence results are substantially different from the corresponding results for the original problem.;math.AP
1801.00812;Limit shapes for Gibbs ensembles of partitions;We explicitly compute limit shapes for several grand canonical Gibbs ensembles of partitions of integers. These ensembles appear in models of aggregation and are also related to invariant measures of zero range and coagulation-fragmentation processes. We show, that all possible limit shapes for these ensembles fall into several distinct classes determined by the asymptotics of the internal energies of aggregates.;math-ph
1801.00813;Force appropriation of nonlinear structures;Nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) are widely used as a tool for developing mathematical models of nonlinear structures and understanding their dynamics. NNMs can be identified experimentally through a phase quadrature condition between the system response and the applied excitation. This paper demonstrates that this commonly-used quadrature condition can give results that are significantly different from the true NNM, in particular when the excitation applied to the system is limited to one input force, as is frequently used in practice. The system studied is a clamped-clamped cross beam with two closely-spaced modes. This paper shows that the regions where the quadrature condition is (in)accurate can be qualitatively captured by analysing transfer of energy between the modes of the system, leading to a discussion of the appropriate number of input forces and their locations across the structure.;math.DS
1801.00819;Block row recursive least squares migration;Recursive estimates of large systems of equations in the context of least squares fitting is a common practice in different fields of study. For example, recursive adaptive filtering is extensively used in signal processing and control applications. The necessity of solving least squares problem via recursive algorithms comes from the need of fast real-time signal processing strategies. Computational cost of using least squares algorithm could also limits the applicability of this technique in geophysical problems. In this paper, we consider recursive least squares solution for wave equation least squares migration with sliding windows involving several rank K downdating and updating computations. This technique can be applied for dynamic and stationary processes. One can show that in the case of stationary processes, the spectrum of the preconditioned system is clustered around one and the method will converge superlinearly with probability one, if we use enough data in each windowed setup. Numerical experiments are reported in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the technique for least squares migration.;math.NA
1801.00827;Computing images of polynomial maps;The image of a polynomial map is a constructible set. While computing its closure is standard in computer algebra systems, a procedure for computing the constructible set itself is not. We provide a new algorithm, based on algebro-geometric techniques, addressing this problem. We also apply these methods to answer a question of W. Hackbusch on the non-closedness of site-independent cyclic matrix product states for infinitely many parameters.;math.AG
1801.00828;Extrapolation for the $L^p$ Dirichlet Problem in Lipschitz domains;Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a second-order linear elliptic operator with complex coefficients. We show that if the $L^p$ Dirichlet problem for the elliptic system $\mathcal{L}(u)=0$ in a fixed Lipschitz domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is solvable for some $1&lt,p=p_0&lt, \frac{2(d-1)}{d-2}$, then it is solvable for all $p$ satisfying $$ p_0&lt,p&lt, \frac{2(d-1)}{d-2} +\varepsilon. $$ The proof is based on a real-variable argument. It only requires that local solutions of $\mathcal{L}(u)=0$ satisfy a boundary Cacciopoli inequality.;math.AP
1801.00832;The Dixmier-Douady Classes of Certain Groupoid $C^*$-Algebras with Continuous Trace;Given a locally compact abelian group $G$, we give an explicit formula for the Dixmier--Douady invariant of the $C^*$-algebra of the groupoid extension associated to a \v{C}ech $2$-cocycle in the sheaf of germs of continuous $G$-valued functions. We then exploit the blow-up construction for groupoids to extend this to some more general central extensions of \'etale equivalence relations.;math.OA
1801.00836;Asymptotic models for transport in large aspect ratio nanopores;Ion flow in charged nanopores is strongly influenced by the ratio of the Debye length to the pore radius. We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) system in narrow pore like geometries and study the influence of the pore geometry and surface charge on ion transport. The physical properties of real pores motivate the investigation of distinguished asymptotic limits, in which either the Debye length and pore radius are comparable or the pore length is very much greater than its radius. This results in a Quasi-1D PNP model which can be further simplified, in the physically relevant limit of strong pore wall surface charge, to a fully one-dimensional model. Favourable comparison is made to the two-dimensional PNP equations in typical pore geometries. It is also shown that, for physically realistic parameters, the standard 1D Area Averaged PNP model for ion flow through a pore is a very poor approximation to the (real) two-dimensional solution to the PNP equations. This leads us to propose that the Quasi-1D PNP model derived here, whose computational cost is significantly less than two-dimensional solution of the PNP equations, should replace the use of the 1D Area Averaged PNP equations as a tool to investigate ion and current flows in ion pores.;math.AP
1801.00838;Differential equations in automorphic forms;Physicists such as Green, Vanhove, et al show that differential equations involving automorphic forms govern the behavior of gravitons. One particular point of interest is solutions to $(\Delta-\lambda)u=E_{\alpha} E_{\beta}$ on an arithmetic quotient of the exceptional group $E_8$. We establish that the existence of a solution to $(\Delta-\lambda)u=E_{\alpha}E_{\beta}$ on the simpler space $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})\backslash SL_2(\mathbb{R})$ for certain values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ depends on nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$. Further, when such a solution exists, we use spectral theory to solve $(\Delta-\lambda)u=E_{\alpha}E_{\beta}$ on $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})\backslash SL_2(\mathbb{R})$ and provide proof of the meromorphic continuation of the solution. The construction of such a solution uses Arthur truncation, the Maass-Selberg formula, and automorphic Sobolev spaces.;math.NT
1801.00846;Linear iterative schemes for doubly degenerate parabolic equations;Mathematical models for flow and reactive transport in porous media often involve non-linear, degenerate parabolic equations. Their solutions have low regularity, and therefore lower order schemes are used for the numerical approximation. Here the backward Euler method is combined with a mixed finite element method scheme, which results in a stable and locally mass-conservative scheme. At the same time, at each time step one has to solve a non-linear algebraic system, for which linear iterations are needed. Finding robust and convergent ones is particularly challenging here, since both slow and fast diffusion cases are allowed. <br />Commonly used schemes, like Newton and Picard iterations, are defined either for non-degenerate problems, or after regularising the problem in the case of degenerate ones. Convergence is guaranteed only if the initial guess is sufficiently close to the solution, which translates into severe restrictions on the time step. Here we discuss a linear iterative scheme which builds on the $L$-scheme, and does not employ any regularisation. We prove its rigourous convergence, which is obtained for mild restrictions on the time step. Finally, we give numerical results confirming the theoretical ones, and compare the behaviour of the scheme with other schemes.;math.NA
1801.00847;Analysis of Hierarchical Ensemble Kalman Inversion;We discuss properties of hierarchical Bayesian inversion through the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Our focus will be primarily on deriving continuous-time limits for hierarchical inversion in the linear case. An important characteristic of the EnKF for inverse problems is that the updated particles are preserved by the linear span of the initial ensemble. By incorporating certain hierarchical approaches we show that we can break away from the induced subspace property. We further consider a number of variants of the EnKF such as covariance inflation and localization, where we derive their continuous-time limits. We verify these results with various numerical experiments through a linear elliptic partial differential equation.;math.NA
1801.00852;A Concentration Result of Estimating Phi-Divergence using Data Dependent Partition;Estimation of the $\phi$-divergence between two unknown probability distributions using empirical data is a fundamental problem in information theory and statistical learning. We consider a multi-variate generalization of the data dependent partitioning method for estimating divergence between the two unknown distributions. Under the assumption that the distribution satisfies a power law of decay, we provide a convergence rate result for this method on the number of samples and hyper-rectangles required to ensure the estimation error is bounded by a given level with a given probability.;math.PR
1801.00856;Phylogenetic trees and homomorphisms;In Chapter 1 we fully characterise pairs of finite graphs which form a gap in the full homomorphism order. This leads to a simple proof of the existence of generalised duality pairs. We also discuss how such results can be carried to relational structures with unary and binary relations. In Chapter 2 we show a very simple and versatile argument based on divisibility which immediately yields the universality of the homomorphism order of directed graphs and discuss three applications. In chapter 3, we show that every interval in the homomorphism order of finite undirected graphs is either universal or a gap. Together with density and universality this "fractal" property contributes to the spectacular properties of the homomorphism order. In Chapter 4 we analyze the phylogenetic information content from a combinatorial point of view by considering the binary relation on the set of taxa defined by the existence of a single event separating two taxa. We show that the graph-representation of this relation must be a tree. Moreover, we characterize completely the relationship between the tree of such relations and the underlying phylogenetic tree.;math.CO
1801.00869;On properties of Bourgeois contact structures;The Bourgeois construction associates to every contact open book on a manifold $V$ a contact structure on $V\times T^2$. We study in this article some of the properties of $V$ that are inherited by $V\times T^2$ and some that are not. <br />Giroux has provided recently a suitable framework to work with contact open books. In the appendix of this article, we quickly review this formalism, and we work out a few classical examples of contact open books to illustrate how to use this new language.;math.SG
1801.00871;Frobenius Reciprocity for Topological Groups;We investigate the existence of left and right adjoints to the restriction functor in three categories of continuous representations of a topological group: discrete, linear complete and compact.;math.RT
1801.00872;On the integral Hodge conjecture for real varieties, I;We formulate the "real integral Hodge conjecture", a version of the integral Hodge conjecture for real varieties, and raise the question of its validity for cycles of dimension 1 on uniruled and Calabi-Yau threefolds and on rationally connected varieties. We relate it to the problem of determining the image of the Borel-Haefliger cycle class map for 1-cycles, with the problem of deciding whether a real variety with no real point contains a curve of even geometric genus and with the problem of computing the torsion of the Chow group of 1-cycles of real threefolds. New results about these problems are obtained along the way.;math.AG
1801.00873;On the integral Hodge conjecture for real varieties, II;We establish the real integral Hodge conjecture for 1-cycles on various classes of uniruled threefolds (conic bundles, Fano threefolds with no real point, some del Pezzo fibrations) and on conic bundles over higher-dimensional bases which themselves satisfy the real integral Hodge conjecture for 1-cycles. In addition, we show that rationally connected threefolds over non-archimedean real closed fields do not satisfy the real integral Hodge conjecture in general and that over such fields, Br\"ocker's EPT theorem remains true for simply connected surfaces of geometric genus zero but fails for some K3 surfaces.;math.AG
1801.00875;On the growth of the number of totally geodesic surfaces in some hyperbolic $3$-manifolds;Let $d$ be a positive square-free integer $\equiv 3 \pmod{4}$ such that there is no invariant of the ideal class group $\mathbb{Q}\lbrack \sqrt{-d}\rbrack$ which is divisible by $4$. We prove an asymptotic formula for the number of immersed totally geodesic surfaces in $\Gamma_{-d}\backslash \mathbb{H}^3$ having area less than $X$.;math.NT
1801.00876;Eigenvalues of random lifts and polynomials of random permutation matrices;Consider a finite sequence of independent random permutations, chosen uniformly either among all permutations or among all matchings on n points. We show that, in probability, as n goes to infinity, these permutations viewed as operators on the (n-1) dimensional vector space orthogonal to the vector with all coordinates equal to 1, are asymptotically strongly free. Our proof relies on the development of a matrix version of the non-backtracking operator theory and a refined trace method. <br />As a byproduct, we show that the non-trivial eigenvalues of random n-lifts of a fixed based graphs approximately achieve the Alon-Boppana bound with high probability in the large n limit. This result generalizes Friedman's Theorem stating that with high probability, the Schreier graph generated by a finite number of independent random permutations is close to Ramanujan. <br />Finally, we extend our results to tensor products of random permutation matrices. This extension is especially relevant in the context of quantum expanders.;math.PR
1801.00878;Moment bounds of a class of stochastic heat equations driven by space-time colored noise in bounded domains;We consider the fractional stochastic heat type equation <br />\begin{align*} <br />\frac{\partial}{\partial t} u_t(x)=-(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}u_t(x)+\xi\sigma(u_t(x))\dot{F}(t,x),\ \ \ x\in D, \ \ t&gt,0, <br />\end{align*} <br />with nonnegative bounded initial condition, where $\alpha\in (0,2]$, $\xi&gt,0$ is the noise level, $\sigma:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a globally Lipschitz function satisfying some growth conditions and the noise term behaves in space like the Riez kernel and is possibly correlated in time and $D$ is the unit open ball centered at the origin in $\mathbb{R}^d$. When the noise term is not correlated in time, we establish a change in the growth of the solution of these equations depending on the noise level $\xi$. On the other hand when the noise term behaves in time like the fractional Brownian motion with index $H\in (1/2,1)$, We also derive explicit bounds leading to a well-known intermittency property.;math.PR
1801.00884;Structure-Preserving &#x393,QR and &#x393,-Lanczos Algorithms for Bethe-Salpeter Eigenvalue Problems;To solve the Bethe-Salpeter eigenvalue problem with distinct sizes, two efficient methods, called {\Gamma}QR algorithm and {\Gamma}-Lanczos algorithm, are proposed in this paper. Both algorithms preserve the special structure of the initial matrix $H=\begin{bmatrix}A &amp, B-\overline{B} &amp, -\overline{A}\end{bmatrix}$, resulting the computed eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors still hold the properties similar to those of $H$. Theorems are given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed two algorithms in theory. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the superiorities of our methods.;math.NA
1801.00889;A Note on the Lipschitz Selection;We present an alternate proof of the passage from the finiteness principle for metric trees to the construction of the core in the C. Fefferman and Shvartsman finiteness theorem for Lipschitz selection problems.;math.FA
1801.00893;Reliable OFDM Receiver with Ultra-Low Resolution ADC;The use of low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) can significantly reduce power consumption and hardware cost. However, their resulting severe nonlinear distortion makes reliable data transmission challenging. For orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission, the orthogonality among subcarriers is destroyed. This invalidates conventional OFDM receivers relying heavily on this orthogonality. In this study, we move on to quantized OFDM (Q-OFDM) prototyping implementation based on our previous achievement in optimal Q-OFDM detection. First, we propose a novel Q-OFDM channel estimator by extending the generalized Turbo (GTurbo) framework formerly applied for optimal detection. Specifically, we integrate a type of robust linear OFDM channel estimator into the original GTurbo framework and derive its corresponding extrinsic information to guarantee its convergence. We also propose feasible schemes for automatic gain control, noise power estimation, and synchronization. Combined with the proposed inference algorithms, we develop an efficient Q-OFDM receiver architecture. Furthermore, we construct a proof-of-concept prototyping system and conduct over-the-air (OTA) experiments to examine its feasibility and reliability. This is the first work that focuses on both algorithm design and system implementation in the field of low-resolution quantization communication. The results of the numerical simulation and OTA experiment demonstrate that reliable data transmission can be achieved.;cs.IT
1801.00896;Parity sheaves and the Hecke category;The Hecke category is emerging as a fundamental object in representation theory. We give a motivated introduction to this category in both its geometric (via parity sheaves) and diagrammatic (generators and relations) incarnations. We also discuss the p-canonical basis and Koszul duality for the Hecke category.;math.RT
1801.00898;Differential Geometry for Model Independent Analysis of Images and Other Non-Euclidean Data: Recent Developments;This article provides an exposition of recent methodologies for nonparametric analysis of digital observations on images and other non-Euclidean objects. Fr\'echet means of distributions on metric spaces, such as manifolds and stratified spaces, have played an important role in this endeavor. Apart from theoretical issues of uniqueness of the Fr\'echet minimizer and the asymptotic distribution of the sample Fr\'echet mean under uniqueness, applications to image analysis are highlighted. In addition, nonparametric Bayes theory is brought to bear on the problems of density estimation and classification on manifolds.;math.ST
1801.00900;Doubling algorithm for the discretized Bethe-Salpeter eigenvalue problem;The discretized Bethe-Salpeter eigenvalue problem arises in the Green's function evaluation in many body physics and quantum chemistry. Discretization leads to a matrix eigenvalue problem for $H \in \mathbb{C}^{2n\times 2n}$ with a Hamiltonian-like structure. After an appropriate transformation of $H$ to a standard symplectic form, the structure-preserving doubling algorithm, originally for algebraic Riccati equations, is extended for the discretized Bethe-Salpeter eigenvalue problem. Potential breakdowns of the algorithm, due to the ill condition or singularity of certain matrices, can be avoided with a double-Cayley transform or a three-recursion remedy. A detailed convergence analysis is conducted for the proposed algorithm, especially on the benign effects of the double-Cayley transform. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and structure-preserving nature of the algorithm.;math.NA
1801.00901;Bounded birationality and isomorphism problems are computable;Let $X,Y$ be two irreducible subvarieties of the projective space $\mathbb{P}^n$, and $d\geq 1$ an integer number. The main result of this paper is an algorithm to construct {\bf explicitly}, in terms of $d$ and the ideals defining $X$ and $Y$, a quasi-affine algebraic variety parametrising the set of all birational maps $f$ from $X$ onto $Y$ which can be extended to a self-rational map of $\mathbb{P}^n$ of degree $\leq d$. <br />Based on this result, we propose an approach towards the rationality problem (see Section 3 below), solve it for some simple cases (varieties of general type or curves), and state a rough strategy for reducing it to some simpler cases via Iitaka's fibrations. <br />We also prove similar results for the case $f$ is a dominant rational map, regular morphism, isomorphism or regular embedding. Similar results are valid for varieties over an arbitrary algebraically closed field, and also for maps on non-projective varieties.;math.AG
1801.00919;Compact-Like Operators in Vector Lattices Normed by Locally Solid Lattices;A linear operator $T$ between two vector lattices normed by locally solid Riesz spaces is said to be $p_\tau$-continuous if, for any $p_\tau$-null net $(x_\alpha)$, the net $(Tx_\alpha)$ is $p_\tau$-null, and $T$ is said to be $p_\tau$-bounded operator if it sends $p_\tau$-bounded subsets to $p_\tau$-bounded subsets. Also, $T$ is called $p_\tau$-compact if, for any $p_\tau$-bounded net $(x_\alpha)$, the net $(Tx_\alpha)$ has a $p_\tau$-convergent subnet. They generalize several known classes of operators such as norm continuous, order continuous, $p$-continuous, order bounded, $p$-bounded, compact and AM-compact operators. We study the general properties of these operators.;math.FA
1801.00921;A finite field analogue of the Appell series $F_4$;We define a function $F_4^{\ast}$ as a finite field analogue of the classical Appell series $F_4$ using Gauss sums. We establish identities for $F_4^{\ast}$ analogous to those satisfied by the classical Appell series $F_4$.;math.NT
1801.00922;Motivic spectral sequence for relative homotopy K-theory;We construct a motivic spectral sequence for the relative homotopy invariant K-theory of a closed immersion of schemes $D \subset X$. The $E_2$-terms of this spectral sequence are the cdh-hypercohomology of a complex of equi-dimensional cycles. <br />Using this spectral sequence, we obtain a cycle class map from the relative motivic cohomology group of 0-cycles to the relative homotopy invariant K-theory. For a smooth scheme $X$ and a divisor $D \subset X$, we construct a canonical homomorphism from the Chow groups with modulus $\CH^i(X|D)$ to the relative motivic cohomology groups $H^{2i}(X|D, \Z(i))$ appearing in the above spectral sequence. This map is shown to be an isomorphism when $X$ is affine and $i = \dim(X)$.;math.AG
1801.00923;On the Application of Reduced Basis Methods to Bifurcation Problems in Incompressible Fluid Dynamics;In this paper we apply a reduced basis framework for the computation of flow bifurcation (and stability) problems in fluid dynamics. The proposed method aims at reducing the complexity and the computational time required for the construction of bifurcation and stability diagrams. The method is quite general since it can in principle be specialized to a wide class of nonlinear problems, but in this work we focus on an application in incompressible fluid dynamics at low Reynolds numbers. The validation of the reduced order model with the full order computation for a benchmark cavity flow problem is promising.;math.NA
1801.00924;Joint Content Delivery and Caching Placement via Dynamic Programming;In this paper, downlink delivery of popular content is optimized with the assistance of wireless cache nodes. Specifically, the requests of one file is modeled as a Poisson point process with finite lifetime, and two downlink transmission modes are considered: (1) the base station multicasts file segments to the requesting users and selected cache nodes, (2) the base station proactively multicasts file segments to the selected cache nodes without requests from users. Hence the cache nodes with decoded files can help to offload the traffic upon the next file request via other air interfaces, e.g. WiFi. Without proactive caching placement, we formulate the downlink traffic offloading as a Markov decision process with random number of stages, and propose a revised Bellman's equation to obtain the optimal control policy. In order to address the prohibitively huge state space, we also introduce a low-complexity sub-optimal solution based on linear approximation of the value functions, where the gap between the approximated value functions and the real ones is bounded analytically. The approximated value functions can be calculated from analytical expressions given the spatial distribution of requesting users. Moreover, we propose a learning-based algorithm to evaluate the approximated value functions for unknown distribution of requesting users. Finally, a proactive caching placement algorithm is introduced to exploit the temporal diversity of shadowing effect. It is shown by simulation that the proposed low-complexity algorithm based on approximated value functions can significantly reduce the resource consumption at the base station, and the proactive caching placement can further improve the performance.;cs.IT
1801.00925;Transcendental singularities for a meromorphic function with logarithmic derivative of finite lower order;In this note it is shown that two key results on transcendental singularities for meromorphic functions of finite lower order have refinements which hold under the weaker hypothesis that the logarithmic derivative has finite lower order.;math.CV

1801.00931;A discrete event traffic model explaining the traffic phases of the train dynamics in a metro line system with a junction;This paper presents a mathematical model for the train dynamics in a mass-transit metro line system with one symmetrically operated junction. We distinguish three parts: a central part and two branches. The tracks are spatially discretized into segments (or blocks) and the train dynamics are described by a discrete event system where the variables are the $k^{th}$ departure times from each segment. The train dynamics are based on two main constraints: a travel time constraint modeling theoretic run and dwell times, and a safe separation constraint modeling the signaling system in case where the traffic gets very dense. The Max-plus algebra model allows to analytically derive the asymptotic average train frequency as a function of many parameters, including train travel times, minimum safety intervals, the total number of trains on the line and the number of trains on each branch. This derivation permits to understand the physics of traffic. In a further step, the results will be used for traffic control.;math.OC
1801.00941;Rigidity results in Diffusion Markov Triples;We consider stable solutions of semilinear equations in a very general setting. The equation is set on a Polish topological space endowed with a measure and the linear operator is induced by a carr\'e du champs (equivalently, the equation is set in a diffusion Markov triple). Under suitable curvature dimension conditions, we establish that stable solutions with integrable carr\'e du champs are necessarily constant (weaker conditions characterize the structure of the carr\'e du champs and carr\'e du champ it\'er\'e). The proofs are based on a geometric Poincar\'e formula in this setting. From the general theorems established, several previous results are obtained as particular cases and new ones are provided as well.;math.AP
1801.00947;Modulus Zero-Forcing Detection for MIMO Channels;We propose a modulus based zero-forcing (MZF) detection for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channels. Traditionally, a ZF detector nulls out all interferences from other layers when detecting a current layer, which can yield suboptimal detection-performance due to the noise-enhancement issue. In many communication systems, finite alphabets such as M quadrature-amplitude-modulation (QAM) are widely used, which comprises \sqrt{M} pulse-amplitude-modulation (PAM) symbols for the real and imaginary parts. With finite alphabets, one feasible way to improve ZF detection is to allow controllable interferences that can be removed away by modulus operations.;cs.IT
1801.00950;Barotropic instability of shear flows;We consider barotropic instability of shear flows for incompressible fluids with Coriolis effects. For a class of shear flows, we develop a new method to find the sharp stability conditions. We study the flow with Sinus profile in details and obtain the sharp stability boundary in the whole parameter space, which corrects previous results in the fluid literature. Our new results are confirmed by more accurate numerical computation. The addition of the Coriolis force is found to bring fundamental changes to the stability of shear flows. Moreover, we study dynamical behaviors near the shear flows, including the bifurcation of nontrivial traveling wave solutions and the linear inviscid damping. The first ingredient of our proof is a careful classification of the neutral modes. The second one is to write the linearized fluid equation in a Hamiltonian form and then use an instability index theory for general Hamiltonian PDEs. The last one is to study the singular and non-resonant neutral modes using Sturm-Liouville theory and hypergeometric functions.;math.AP

We focus on the centrally essential modular group algebras of finite groups over fields of nonzero characteristic.

1801.00952;Non-isometric domains with the same Marvizi-Melrose invariants;For any strictly convex planar domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ with a $C^\infty$ boundary one can associate an infinite sequence of spectral invariants introduced by Marvizi-Merlose. These invariants can generically be determined using the spectrum of the Dirichlet problem of the Laplace operator. A natural question asks if this collection is sufficient to determine $\Omega$ up to isometry. In this paper we give a counterexample, namely, we present two non-isometric domains $\Omega$ and $\bar \Omega$ with the same collection of Marvizi-Melrose invariants. Moreover, each domain has countably many periodic orbits $\{S^n\}_{n \geqslant 1}$ (resp. $\{ \bar S^n\}_{n \geqslant 1}$) of period going to infinity such that $ S^n $ and $ \bar S^n $ have the same period and perimeter for each $ n $.;math.DS
1801.00953;Admissibility and the $C_2$ Spider;A tensor category is multiplicity-free if for any objects $A,B,C$ we have that $\mathrm{Hom}(A\otimes B\otimes C,\mathbb{C})$ is either $0$ or $1$ dimensional. It is known that $Rep^{uni}(U_q(\mathfrak{sp}(4)))$ is not multiplicty-free. We find a full subcategory of $Rep^{uni}(U_q(\mathfrak{sp}(4)))$ which is multiplicty-free. A description of the dimension of these $\mathrm{Hom}$ spaces is given for this subcategory, including when $q$ is a root of unity. The methods used arise from the description, given by Kuperberg, of $Rep^{uni}(U_q(\mathfrak{sp}(4)))$ as a spider. The main tool is the recursive definition of clasps given by Kim. In particular, we provide an appropriate notion of admissibility when looking at the $\mathrm{Sp}(4)_k$ ribbon graph invariants with restricted edge labels.;math.QA
1801.00957;Exponential stabilization of cascade ode-reaction-diffusion pde by pointwise actuation;In this paper, we are concerned with the state feedback stabilization of ODE-PDE cascade systems governed by a linear ordinary differential equation and the 1-d reaction-diffusion equation posed on a bounded interval. In contrast to the previous works in the literature where the control acts at the boundary, the control for the entire system acts at an inside point of the PDE domain whereas the PDE acts in the linear ODE by a Neumann connection. We use the infinite dimensional backstepping design to convert system under consideration to an exponentially target system. By invertibility of the design and Lyapunov analysis, we prove the well posedness and exponential stability of such system.;math.AP
1801.00958;Exponential stabilization of cascade ode-linearized kdv system by boundary Dirichlet actuation;In this paper, we solve the problem of exponential stabilization for a class of cascade ODE-PDE system governed by a linear ordinary differential equation and a 1-d linearized Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV) posed on a bounded interval. The control for the entire system acts on the left boundary with Dirichlet condition of the KdV equation whereas the KdV acts in the linear ODE by a Dirichlet connection. We use the socalled backstepping design in infinite dimension to convert the system under consideration into an exponentially stable cascade ODE-PDE system.Then, we use the invertibility of such design to achieve the exponential stability for the ODE-PDE cascade system under consideration by using Lyapunov analysis.;math.AP
1801.00961;On maximum distance separable group codes with complementary duals;Given an LCD group code $C$ in a group algebra $KG$, we inspect kinship between $C$ and $G$, more precisely between the subgroup structures of $G$ and $C$. Under some special circumstances our inspection provides an estimation for various parameters of a group code $C$. When $C$ is MDS, the inter relation between $K$ and $G$ becomes more impressive. Application of Sylow theorem facilitated us to explore the inter relation between $G$ and $K$ (when $C$ is LCD and MDS) in more general way and finally we get the result of Cruz and Willems (Lemma $4.4$) as a simple sequel.;math.RA
1801.00963;A New Design Paradigm for Secure Full-Duplex Multiuser Systems;We consider a full-duplex (FD) multiuser system where an FD base station (BS) is designed to simultaneously serve both downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) users in the presence of half-duplex eavesdroppers (Eves). The problem is to maximize the minimum (max-min) secrecy rate (SR) among all legitimate users, where the information signals at the FD-BS are accompanied with artificial noise to debilitate the Eves' channels. To enhance the max-min SR, a major part of the power budget should be allocated to serve the users with poor channel qualities, such as those far from the FD-BS, undermining the SR for other users, and thus compromising the SR per-user. In addition, the main obstacle in designing an FD system is due to the self-interference (SI) and co-channel interference (CCI) among users. We therefore propose an alternative solution, where the FD-BS uses a fraction of the time block to serve near DL users and far UL users, and the remaining fractional time to serve other users. The proposed scheme mitigates the harmful effects of SI, CCI and multiuser interference, and provides system robustness. The SR optimization problem has a highly nonconcave and nonsmooth objective, subject to nonconvex constraints. For the case of perfect channel state information (CSI), we develop a low-complexity path-following algorithm, which involves only a simple convex program of moderate dimension at each iteration. We show that our path-following algorithm guarantees convergence at least to a local optimum. Then, we extend the path-following algorithm to the cases of partially known Eves' CSI, where only statistics of CSI for the Eves are known, and worst-case scenario in which Eves can employ a more advanced linear decoder. The merit of our proposed approach is further demonstrated by extensive numerical results.;cs.IT
1801.00965;Phase Transition of Convex Programs for Linear Inverse Problems with Multiple Prior Constraints;A sharp phase transition emerges in convex programs when solving the linear inverse problem, which aims to recover a structured signal from its linear measurements. This paper studies this phenomenon in theory under Gaussian random measurements. Different from previous studies, in this paper, we consider convex programs with multiple prior constraints. These programs are encountered in many cases, for example, when the signal is sparse and its $\ell_2$ norm is known beforehand, or when the signal is sparse and non-negative simultaneously. Given such a convex program, to analyze its phase transition, we introduce a new set and a new cone, called the prior restricted set and prior restricted cone, respectively. Our results reveal that the phase transition of a convex problem occurs at the statistical dimension of its prior restricted cone. Moreover, to apply our theoretical results in practice, we present two recipes to accurately estimate the statistical dimension of the prior restricted cone. These two recipes work under different conditions, and we give a detailed analysis for them. To further illustrate our results, we apply our theoretical results and the estimation recipes to study the phase transition of two specific problems, and obtain computable formulas for the statistical dimension and related error bounds. Simulations are provided to demonstrate our results.;cs.IT

We define these transforms in such a way that they characterize any probability distribution on the real line and are Fenchel conjugates of each other. We show that uniform integrability, weak convergence and tightness admit a convenient characterization in terms of integrated quantile functions. As an application we demonstrate how some basic results of the theory of comparison of binary statistical experiments can be deduced using integrated quantile functions. Finally, we extend the area of application of the Chacon--Walsh construction in the Skorokhod embedding problem.;math.PR

1801.00981;A Model-Free Selection Criterion For The Mixing Coefficient Of Spatial Max-Mixture Models;One of the main concerns in extreme value theory is to quantify the dependence between joint tails. Using stochastic processes that lack flexibility in the joint tail may lead to severe under-or over-estimation of probabilities associated to simultaneous extreme events. Following recent advances in the literature, a flexible model called max-mixture model has been introduced for modeling situations where the extremal dependence structure may vary with the distance. In this paper we propose a nonparametric model-free selection criterion for the mixing coefficient Our criterion is derived from a madogram, a notion classically used in geostatistics to capture spatial structures. The procedure is based on a nonlinear least squares between the theoretical madogram and the empirical one. We perform a simulation study and apply our criterion to daily precipitation over the East of Australia.;math.ST
1801.00983;Stabilisation of wave equations on the torus with rough dampings;For the damped wave equation on a compact manifold with {\em continuous} dampings, the geometric control condition is necessary and sufficient for {uniform} stabilisation. In this article, on the two dimensional torus, in the special case where $a(x) = \sum\_{j=1}^N a\_j 1\_{x\in R\_j}$ ($R\_j$ are polygons), we give a very simple necessary and sufficient geometric condition for uniform stabilisation. We also propose a natural generalization of the geometric control condition which makes sense for $L^\infty$ dampings. We show that this condition is always necessary for uniform stabilisation (for any compact (smooth) manifold and any $L^\infty$ damping), and we prove that it is sufficient in our particular case on $\mathbb{T}^2$ (and for our particular dampings).;math.AP

By nonzero rectangular Kronecker coefficients, we give counterexamples for Klyachko's conjecture which says that a quantum state with maximal lexicographical spectrum has minimal rank among all states with given margins. Moreover, we show that quantum states with the maximal lexicographical spectrum are extreme points.;math.RT
1801.00988;Joint Uplink and Downlink Resource Configuration for Ultra-reliable and Low-latency Communications;Supporting ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) is one of the major goals for the fifth-generation cellular networks. Since spectrum usage efficiency is always a concern, and large bandwidth is required for ensuring stringent quality-of-service (QoS), we minimize the total bandwidth under the QoS constraints of URLLC. We first propose a packet delivery mechanism for URLLC. To reduce the required bandwidth for ensuring queueing delay, we consider a statistical multiplexing queueing mode, where the packets to be sent to different devices are waiting in one queue at the base station, and broadcast mode is adopted in downlink transmission. In this way, downlink bandwidth is shared among packets of multiple devices. In uplink transmission, different subchannels are allocated to different devices to avoid strong interference. Then, we jointly optimize uplink and downlink bandwidth configuration and delay components to minimize the total bandwidth required to guarantee the overall packet loss and end-to-end delay, which includes uplink and downlink transmission delays, queueing delay and backhaul delay. We propose a two-step method to find the optimal solution. Simulation and numerical results validate our analysis and show remarkable performance gain by jointly optimizing uplink and downlink configuration.;cs.IT
1801.00989;On the invariance equation for two-variable weighted nonsymmetric Bajraktarevi&#x107, means;The purpose of this paper is to investigate the invariance of the arithmetic mean with respect to two weighted Bajraktarevi\'c means, i.e., to solve the functional equation $$ <br />\bigg(\frac{f}{g}\bigg)^{\!\!-1}\!\!\bigg(\frac{tf(x)+sf(y)}{tg(x)+sg(y)}\bigg) <br />+\bigg(\frac{h}{k}\bigg)^{\!\!-1}\!\!\bigg(\frac{sh(x)+th(y)}{sk(x)+tk(y)}\bigg)=x+y \qquad(x,y\in I), $$ where $f,g,h,k:I\to\mathbb{R}$ are unknown continuous functions such that $g,k$ are nowhere zero on $I$, the ratio functions $f/g$, $h/k$ are strictly monotone on $I$, and $t,s\in\mathbb{R}_+$ are constants different from each other. By the main result of this paper, the solutions of the above invariance equation can be expressed either in terms of hyperbolic functions or in terms of trigonometric functions and an additional weight function. For the necessity part of this result, we will assume that $f,g,h,k:I\to\mathbb{R}$ are four times continuously differentiable.;math.CA
1801.00990;A two-stage fourth order time-accurate discretization for Lax--Wendroff type flow solvers II. High order numerical boundary conditions;This paper serves to treat boundary conditions numerically with high order accuracy in order to match the two-stage fourth-order finite volume schemes for hyperbolic problems developed in [{\em J. Li and Z. Du, A two-stage fourth order time-accurate discretization {L}ax--{W}endroff type flow solvers, {I}. {H}yperbolic conservation laws, SIAM, J. Sci. Comput., 38 (2016), pp.~A3046--A3069}]. As such, it is significant when capturing small scale structures near physical boundaries. Different from previous contributions in literature, the current approach constructs a fourth order accurate approximation to boundary conditions by only using the Jacobian of the flux function (characteristic information) instead of its successive differentiation leading to tensors of high ranks in the inverse Lax-Wendroff method. Technically, data in several ghost cells are constructed with interpolation so that the interior scheme can be implemented over boundary cells, and theoretical boundary condition has to be modified properly at intermediate stages so as to make the two-stage scheme over boundary cells fully consistent with that over interior cells. This highlights the fact that {\em continuous boundary conditions only match continuous partial differential equations (PDEs), and they must be approximated in a consistent way (even though it could be exactly valued) when the PDEs are discretized.} Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the current approach when dealing with general boundary conditions.;math.NA
1801.00992;The Capacity on Degraded Relay Broadcast Channel;The relay broadcast channel (RBC) is considered, in which a transmitter communicates with two receivers with the assistance of a relay. Based on different degradation orders among the relay and the receivers' outputs, three types of physically degraded RBCs (PDRBCs) are introduced. Inner bounds and outer bounds are derived on the capacity region of the presented three types. The bounds are tight for two types of PDRBCs: 1) one receiver's output is a degraded form of the other receiver's output, and the relay's output is a degraded form of the weaker receiver's output, 2) one receiver's output is a degraded form of the relay's output, and the other receiver's output is a degraded form of the relay's output. For the Gaussian PDRBC, the bounds match, i.e., establish its capacity region.;cs.IT
1801.01006;The risk model with stochastic premiums, dependence and a threshold dividend strategy;The paper deals with a generalization of the risk model with stochastic premiums where dependence structures between claim sizes and inter-claim times as well as premium sizes and inter-premium times are modeled by Farlie--Gumbel--Morgenstern copulas. In addition, dividends are paid to its shareholders according to a threshold dividend strategy. We derive integral and integro-differential equations for the Gerber--Shiu function and the expected discounted dividend payments until ruin. Next, we concentrate on the detailed investigation of the model in the case of exponentially distributed claim and premium sizes. In particular, we find explicit formulas for the ruin probability in the model without either dividend payments or dependence as well as for the expected discounted dividend payments in the model without dependence. Finally, numerical illustrations are presented.;math.PR
1801.01007;A Comprehensive Bayesian Treatment of the Universal Kriging model with Mat&#xe9,rn correlation kernels;The Gibbs reference posterior distribution provides an objective full-Bayesian solution to the problem of prediction of a stationary Gaussian process with Mat\'ern anisotropic kernel. A full-Bayesian approach is possible, because the posterior distribution is expressed as the invariant distribution of a uniformly ergodic Markovian kernel for which we give an explicit expression. In this paper, we show that it is appropriate for the Universal Kriging framework, that is when an unknown function is added to the stationary Gaussian process. We give sufficient conditions for the existence and propriety of the Gibbs reference posterior that apply to a wide variety of practical cases and illustrate the method with several examples. Finally, simulations of Gaussian processes suggest that the Gibbs reference posterior has good frequentist properties in terms of coverage of prediction intervals.;math.ST

1801.01014;Finite asymptotic clusters of metric spaces;Let $(X, d)$ be an unbounded metric space and let $\tilde r=(r_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ be a sequence of positive real numbers tending to infinity. A pretangent space $\Omega_{\infty, \tilde r}^{X}$ to $(X, d)$ at infinity is a limit of the rescaling sequence $\left(X, \frac{1}{r_n}d\right).$ The set of all pretangent spaces $\Omega_{\infty, \tilde r}^{X}$ is called an asymptotic cluster of pretangent spaces. Such a cluster can be considered as a weighted graph $(G_{X, \tilde r}, \rho_{X})$ whose maximal cliques coincide with $\Omega_{\infty, \tilde r}^{X}$ and the weight $\rho_{X}$ is defined by metrics on $\Omega_{\infty, \tilde r}^{X}$. We describe the structure of metric spaces having finite asymptotic clusters of pretangent spaces and characterize the finite weighted graphs which are isomorphic to these clusters.;math.MG

1801.01022;Shannon Capacity is Achievable for Binary Interactive First-Order Markovian Protocols;We address the problem of simulating an arbitrary binary interactive first-order Markovian protocol over a pair of binary symmetric channels with crossover probability $\varepsilon$. We are interested in the achievable rates of reliable simulation, i.e., in characterizing the smallest possible blowup in communications such that a vanishing error probability (in the protocol length) can be attained. Whereas for general interactive protocols the output of each party may depend on all previous outputs of its counterpart, in a (first-order) Markovian protocol this dependence is limited to the last observed output only. Previous works in the field discuss broader families of protocols but assess the achievable rates only at the limit where $\varepsilon\to0$. <br />In this paper, we prove that the one-way Shannon capacity, $1-h(\varepsilon)$, can be achieved for any binary first-order Markovian protocol. This surprising result, is to the best of our knowledge, the first example in which non-trivial interactive protocol can be simulated in the Shannon capacity. We give two capacity achieving coding schemes, which both divide the protocol into independent blocks, and implement vertical block coding. The first scheme is based on a random separation into blocks with variable lengths. The second scheme is based on a deterministic separation into blocks, and efficiently predicting their last transmission. The prediction can be regarded as a binary pointer jumping game, for which we show that the final step can be calculated with $O(\log m)$ bits, where $m$ is the number of rounds in the game. We conclude the work by discussing possible extensions of the result to higher order models.;cs.IT
1801.01023;Calder&#xf3,n-Zygmund operators on Zygmund spaces on domains;Given a bounded Lipschitz domain $D\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and a Calder\'on-Zygmund operator $T$, we study the relations between smoothness properties of $\partial D$ and the boundedness of $T$ on the Zydmund space $\mathcal{C}_{\omega}(D)$ defined for a general growth function $\omega$. In the proof we obtain a T(P) theorem for the Zygmund spaces, when one checks boundedness not only of the characteristic function, but a finite collection of polynomials restricted to the domain. Also, a new form of extra cancellation property of the even Calder\'on-Zygmund operators in polynomial domains is stated.;math.FA

We also establish an optimal rate of density for the values of polynomials maps in a number of other natural problems, including the values of linear forms restricted to suitable quadratic surfaces, and the values of the polynomial map defined by the generators of the ring of conjugation-invariant polynomials on $M_3(\C)$. <br />These results are instances of a general approach that we develop, which considers a rational affine algebraic subvariety of Euclidean space, invariant and homogeneous under an action of a semisimple Lie group $G$. Given a polynomial map $F$ defined on the Euclidean space which is invariant under a semisimple subgroup $H$ of the acting group $G$, consider the family of its translates $F\circ g$ by elements of the group. We study the restriction of these polynomial functions to the integer points on the variety confined to a large Euclidean ball. Our main results establish an explicit rate of density for their values, for generic polynomials in the family. This problem has been extensively studied before when the polynomials in question are linear, in the context of classical Diophantine approximation, but very little was known about it for polynomial of higher degree. We formulate a heuristic pigeonhole lower bound for the density and an explicit upper bound for it, formulate a sufficient condition for the coincidence of the lower and upper bounds, and in a number of natural examples establish that they indeed match. Finally, we also establish a rate of density for values of homogeneous polynomials on homogeneous projective varieties.;math.NT

1801.01030;Dissipative measure valued solutions for general conservation laws;In the last years measure-valued solutions started to be considered as a relevant notion of solutions if they satisfy the so-called measure-valued -- strong uniqueness principle. This means that they coincide with a strong solution emanating from the same initial data if this strong solution exists. This property has been examined for many systems of mathematical physics, including incompressible and compressible Euler system, compressible Navier-Stokes system et al. and there are also some results concerning general hyperbolic systems. Our goal is to provide a unified framework for general systems, that would cover the most interesting cases of systems, and most importantly, we give examples of equations, for which the aspect of measure-valued -- strong uniqueness has not been considered before, like incompressible magentohydrodynamics and shallow water magnetohydrodynamics.;math.AP

1801.01047;On the exact maximum induced density of almost all graphs and their inducibility;Let $H$ be a graph on $h$ vertices. The number of induced copies of $H$ in a graph $G$ is denoted by $i_H(G)$. Let $i_H(n)$ denote the maximum of $i_H(G)$ taken over all graphs $G$ with $n$ vertices. <br />Let $f(n,h) = \Pi_{i}^h a_i$ where $\sum_{i=1}^h a_i = n$ and the $a_i$ are as equal as possible. Let $g(n,h) = f(n,h) + \sum_{i=1}^h g(a_i,h)$. It is proved that for almost all graphs $H$ on $h$ vertices it holds that $i_H(n)=g(n,h)$ for all $n \le 2^{\sqrt{h}}$. More precisely, we define an explicit graph property ${\cal P}_h$ which, when satisfied by $H$, guarantees that $i_H(n)=g(n,h)$ for all $n \le 2^{\sqrt{h}}$. It is proved, in particular, that a random graph on $h$ vertices satisfies ${\cal P}_h$ with probability $1-o_h(1)$. Furthermore, all extremal $n$-vertex graphs yielding $i_H(n)$ in the aforementioned range are determined. <br />We also prove a stability result. For $H \in {\cal P}_h$ and a graph $G$ with $n \le 2^{\sqrt{h}}$ vertices satisfying $i_H(G) \ge f(n,h)$, it must be that $G$ is obtained from a balanced blowup of $H$ by adding some edges inside the blowup parts. <br />The {\em inducibility} of $H$ is $i_H = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} i_H(n)/\binom{n}{h}$. It is known that $i_H \ge h!/(h^h-h)$ for all graphs $H$ and that a random graph $H$ satisfies almost surely that $i_H \le h^{3\log h}h!/(h^h-h)$. We improve upon this upper bound almost matching the lower bound. It is shown that a graph $H$ which satisfies ${\cal P}_h$ has $i_H =(1+O(h^{-h^{1/3}}))h!/(h^h-h)$.;math.CO
1801.01050;Information Bottleneck on General Alphabets;We prove rigorously a source coding theorem that can probably be considered folklore, a generalization to arbitrary alphabets of a problem motivated by the Information Bottleneck method.

The proof relies on the well established discrete case and showcases a technique for lifting discrete coding theorems to arbitrary alphabets.;cs.IT
1801.01055;Gaps between prime numbers and tensor rank of multiplication in finite fields;We present effective upper bounds on the symmetric bilinear complexity of multiplication in extensions of a base finite field Fp2 of prime square order, obtained by combining estimates on gaps between prime numbers together with an optimal construction of auxiliary divisors for multiplication algorithms by evaluation-interpolation on curves. Most of this material dates back to a 2011 unpublished work of the author, but it still provides the best results on this topic at the present time. <br />Then a few updates are given in order to take recent developments into account, including comparison with a similar work of Ballet and Zykin, generalization to classical bilinear complexity over Fp, and to short multiplication of polynomials, as well as a discussion of open questions on gaps between prime numbers or more generally values of certain arithmetic functions.;math.NT
1801.01056;A New HDG Method for Dirichlet Boundary Control of Convection Diffusion PDEs II: Low Regularity;In the first part of this work, we analyzed a Dirichlet boundary control problem for an elliptic convection diffusion PDE and proposed a new hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method to approximate the solution. For the case of a 2D polygonal domain, we also proved an optimal superlinear convergence rate for the control under certain assumptions on the domain and on the target state. In this work, we revisit the convergence analysis without these assumptions, in this case, the solution can have low regularity and we use a different analysis approach. We again prove an optimal convergence rate for the control, and present numerical results to illustrate the convergence theory.;math.NA
1801.01060;A strictly commutative model for the cochain algebra of a space;The commutative differential graded algebra $A_{\mathrm{PL}}(X)$ of polynomial forms on a simplicial set $X$ is a crucial tool in rational homotopy theory. In this note, we construct an integral version $A^{\mathcal{I}}(X)$ of $A_{\mathrm{PL}}(X)$. Our approach uses diagrams of chain complexes indexed by the category of finite sets and injections $\mathcal{I}$ to model $E_{\infty}$ differential graded algebras by strictly commutative objects, called commutative $\mathcal{I}$-dgas. We define a functor $A^{\mathcal{I}}$ from simplicial sets to commutative $\mathcal{I}$-dgas and show that it is a commutative lift of the usual cochain algebra functor. In particular, it gives rise to a new construction of the $E_{\infty}$ dga of cochains. <br />The functor $A^{\mathcal{I}}$ shares many properties of $A_{\mathrm{PL}}$, and can be viewed as a generalization of $A_{\mathrm{PL}}$ that works over arbitrary commutative ground rings. Working over the integers, a theorem by Mandell implies that $A^{\mathcal{I}}(X)$ determines the homotopy type of $X$ when $X$ is a nilpotent space of finite type.;math.AT
1801.01062;Construction of Algorithms for Parallel Addition;An algebraic number $\beta \in \mathbb{C}$ with no conjugate of modulus 1 can serve as the base of a numeration system $(\beta, \mathcal{A})$ with parallel addition, i.e., the sum of two operands represented in base $\beta$ with digits from $\mathcal{A}$ is calculated in constant time, irrespective of the length of the operands. In order to allow parallel addition, sufficient level of redundancy must be given to the alphabet $\mathcal{A}$. The complexity of parallel addition algorithm depends heavily on the size $\#\mathcal{A}$ of the alphabet: the bigger alphabet is considered, the lower complexity of the parallel addition algorithm may be reached, and vice versa. Here we aim to find parallel addition algorithms on alphabets of the minimal possible size, for a given base. As the complexity of these algorithms becomes quite huge in general, we introduce a so-called Extending Window Method (EWM) - in fact an algorithm to construct parallel addition algorithms. This method can be applied on bases $\beta$ which are expanding algebraic integers, i.e., $\beta$ whose all conjugates are greater than 1 in modulus. Convergence of the EWM is not guaranteed, nevertheless, we have developed tools for revealing non-convergence, and there is a number of successful applications. Firstly, the EWM provides the same parallel addition algorithms as were previously introduced by A. Avizienis, C.Y. Chow &amp, J.E. Robertson or B. Parhami for integer bases and alphabets. Then, by applying the EWM on selected complex bases $\beta$ with non-integer alphabets $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathbb{Z}[\beta]$, we obtain new results - parallel addition algorithms on alphabets of minimal possible size, which could not be found so far (manually). The EWM is helpful also in the case of block parallel addition.;math.NT
1801.01069;Theoretical links between universal and Bayesian compressed sensing algorithms;Quantized maximum a posteriori (Q-MAP) is a recently-proposed Bayesian compressed sensing algorithm that, given the source distribution, recovers $X^n$ from its linear measurements $Y^m=AX^n$, where $A\in R^{m\times n}$ denotes the known measurement matrix. On the other hand, Lagrangian minimum entropy pursuit (L-MEP) is a universal compressed sensing algorithm that aims at recovering $X^n$ from its linear measurements $Y^m=AX^n$, without having access to the source distribution. Both Q-MAP and L-MEP provably achieve the minimum required sampling rates, in noiseless cases where such fundamental limits are known. L-MEP is based on minimizing a cost function that consists of a linear combination of the conditional empirical entropy of a potential reconstruction vector and its corresponding measurement error. In this paper, using a first-order linear approximation of the conditional empirical entropy function, L-MEP is connected with Q-MAP. The established connection between L-MEP and Q-MAP leads to variants of Q-MAP which have the same asymptotic performance as Q-MAP in terms of their required sampling rates. Moreover, these variants suggest that Q-MAP is robust to small error in estimating the source distribution. This robustness is theoretically proven and the effect of a non-vanishing estimation error on the required sampling rate is characterized.;cs.IT
1801.01072;Randomized Linear Algebra Approaches to Estimate the Von Neumann Entropy of Density Matrices;Thevon Neumann entropy, named after John von Neumann, is an extension of the classical concept of entropy to the field of quantum mechanics. From a numerical perspective, von Neumann entropy can be computed simply by computing all eigenvalues of a density matrix, an operation that could be prohibitively expensive for large-scale density matrices. We present and analyze three randomized algorithms to approximate von Neumann entropy of {real} density matrices: our algorithms leverage recent developments in the Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra (RandNLA) literature, such as randomized trace estimators, provable bounds for the power method, and the use of random projections to approximate the eigenvalues of a matrix. All three algorithms come with provable accuracy guarantees and our experimental evaluations support our theoretical findings showing considerable speedup with small loss in accuracy.;cs.IT
1801.01074;Forcing large tight components in 3-graphs;Any $n$-vertex $3$-graph with minimum codegree at least $\lfloor n/3\rfloor$ must have a spanning tight component, but immediately below this threshold it is possible for no tight component to span more than $\lceil 2n/3\rceil$ vertices. Motivated by this observation, we ask which codegree forces a tight component of at least any given size. The corresponding function seems to have infinitely many discontinuities, but we provide upper and lower bounds, which asymptotically converge as the function nears the origin.;math.CO
1801.01079;Exact Calculation of the Mean-Square Error in the Method of Expansion of Iterated Ito Stochastic integrals Based on Generalized Multiple Fourier Series;The article is devoted to the developement of the method of expansion and mean-square approximation of iterated Ito stochastic integrals based on generalized multiple Fourier series converging in the sense of norm in the space $L_2([t, T]^k)$ ($k$ is the multiplicity of the iterated Ito stochastic integral). We obtain the exact and approximate expressions for the mean-square error of approximation of iterated Ito stochastic integrals of multiplicity $k$ ($k\in\mathbb{N}$) from the stochastic Taylor-Ito expansion in the framework of the mentioned method. As a result, we do not need to use redundant terms of expansions of iterated Ito stochastic integrals, that complicate the numerical methods for Ito stochastic differential equations. Moreover, we proved the convergence with propability 1 of the method of expansion of iterated Ito stochastic integrals based on generalized multiple Fourier series for the cases of multiple Fourier-Legendre series and multiple trigonometric Fourier series. The results of the article can be applied to the high-order strong numerical methods for Ito stochastic differential equations as well as non-commutative semilinear stochastic partial differential equations with multiplicative trace class noise (in accordance with the mean-square criterion of convergence).;math.PR
1801.01082;A first integrability result for Miquel dynamics;Miquel dynamics is a discrete-time dynamical system on the space of square-grid circle patterns. For biperiodic circle patterns with both periods equal to two, we show that the dynamics corresponds to translation on an elliptic curve, thus providing the first integrability result for this dynamics. The main tool is a geometric interpretation of the addition law on the normalization of binodal quartic curves.;math.DS

We also find the ratio between the determinant of the moment matrix corresponding to the multiple orthogonal polynomials and the determinant of the moment matrix from the original planar measure.;math-ph
1801.01088;Convergence rates of Forward--Douglas--Rachford splitting method;Over the past years, operator splitting methods have become ubiquitous for non-smooth optimization owing to their simplicity and efficiency. In this paper, we consider the Forward--Douglas--Rachford splitting method (FDR) [10,40], and study both global and local convergence rates of this method. For the global rate, we establish an $o(1/k)$ convergence rate in terms of a Bregman divergence suitably designed for the objective function. Moreover, when specializing to the case of Forward--Backward splitting method, we show that convergence rate of the objective function of the method is actually $o(1/k)$ for a large choice of the descent step-size. Then locally, based on the assumption that the non-smooth part of the optimization problem is partly smooth, we establish local linear convergence of the method. More precisely, we show that the sequence generated by FDR method first (i) identifies a smooth manifold in a finite number of iteration, and then (ii) enters a local linear convergence regime, which is for instance characterized in terms of the structure of the underlying active smooth manifold. To exemplify the usefulness of the obtained result, we consider several concrete numerical experiments arising from applicative fields including, for instance, signal/image processing, inverse problems and machine learning.;math.OC
1801.01091;Independence number of graphs with a prescribed number of cliques;We consider the following problem posed by Erdos in 1962. Suppose that $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph where the number of $s$-cliques in $G$ is $t$. How small can the independence number of $G$ be? Our main result suggests that for fixed $s$, the smallest possible independence number undergoes a transition at $t=n^{s/2+o(1)}$. <br />In the case of triangles ($s=3$) we obtain the following result which is sharp apart from constant factors and generalizes basic results in Ramsey theory: there exists $c&gt,0$ such that every $n$-vertex graph with $t$ triangles has independence number at least $$c \cdot \min\left\{ \sqrt {n \log n}\, , \, \frac{n}{t^{1/3}} \left(\log \frac{n}{ t^{1/3}}\right)^{2/3} \right\}.$$;math.CO

We show that in an appropriate limit $E_{kk}^{(n)} \sim 2\kern .3pt H^{k+1/2}$ independently of $n$, where $H \approx 1/9.28903$ is Halphen's constant. This is the same formula as for minimax approximation of $e^x$ on $(-\infty,0\kern .3pt]$.;math.NA

1801.01101;The Hilbert scheme of space curves sitting on a smooth surface containing a line;We continue the study of maximal families W of the Hilbert scheme, H(d,g)_{sc}, of smooth connected space curves whose general curve C lies on a smooth degree-s surface S containing a line. For s &gt, 3, we extend the two ranges where W is a unique irreducible (resp. generically smooth) component of H(d,g)_{sc}. In another range, close to the boarder of the nef cone, we describe for s=4 and 5 components W that are non-reduced, leaving open the non-reducedness of only 3 (resp. 2) families for s &gt, 5 (resp. s=5), thus making progress to recent results of Kleppe and Ottem in [28]. For s=3 we slightly extend previous results on a conjecture of non-reduced components, and in addition we show its existence in a subrange of the conjectured range.;math.AG
1801.01103;A low-rank projector-splitting integrator for the Vlasov--Poisson equation;Many problems encountered in plasma physics require a description by kinetic equations, which are posed in an up to six-dimensional phase space. A direct discretization of this phase space, often called the Eulerian approach, has many advantages but is extremely expensive from a computational point of view. In the present paper we propose a dynamical low-rank approximation to the Vlasov--Poisson equation, with time integration by a particular splitting method. This approximation is derived by constraining the dynamics to a manifold of low-rank functions via a tangent space projection and by splitting this projection into the subprojections from which it is built. This reduces a time step for the six- (or four-) dimensional Vlasov--Poisson equation to solving two systems of three- (or two-) dimensional advection equations over the time step, once in the position variables and once in the velocity variables, where the size of each system of advection equations is equal to the chosen rank. By a hierarchical dynamical low-rank approximation, a time step for the Vlasov--Poisson equation can be further reduced to a set of six (or four) systems of one-dimensional advection equations, where the size of each system of advection equations is still equal to the rank. The resulting systems of advection equations can then be solved by standard techniques such as semi-Lagrangian or spectral methods. Numerical simulations in two and four dimensions for linear Landau damping, for a two-stream instability and for a plasma echo problem highlight the favorable behavior of this numerical method and show that the proposed algorithm is able to drastically reduce the required computational effort.;math.NA
1801.01106;On certain edge-transitive bicirculants;A graph $\Gamma$ of even order is a bicirculant if it admits an automorphism with two orbits of equal length. Symmetry properties of bicirculants, for which at least one of the induced subgraphs on the two orbits of the corresponding semiregular automorphism is a cycle, have been studied, at least for the few smallest possible valences. For valences $3$, $4$ and $5$, where the corresponding bicirculants are called generalized Petersen graphs, Rose window graphs and Taba\v{c}jn graphs, respectively, all edge-transitive members have been classified. While there are only 7 edge-transitive generalized Petersen graphs and only 3 edge-transitive Taba\v{c}jn graphs, infinite families of edge-transitive Rose window graphs exist. The main theme of this paper is the question of the existence of such bicirculants for higher valences. It is proved that infinite families of edge-transitive examples of valence $6$ exist and among them infinitely many arc-transitive as well as infinitely many half-arc-transitive members are identified. Moreover, the classification of the ones of valence $6$ and girth $3$ is given. As a corollary, an infinite family of half-arc-transitive graphs of valence $6$ with universal reachability relation, which were thus far not known to exist, is obtained.;math.CO
1801.01109;Biderivations and commuting linear maps on Lie algebras;Let $L$ be a Lie algebra over a field of characteristic different from $2$. If $L$ is perfect and centerless, then every skew-symmetric biderivation $\delta:L\times L\to L$ is of the form $\delta(x,y)=\gamma([x,y])$ for all $x,y\in L$, where $\gamma\in{\rm Cent}(L)$, the centroid of $L$. Under a milder assumption that $[c,[L,L]]=\{0\}$ implies $c=0$, every commuting linear map from $L$ to $L$ lies in ${\rm Cent}(L)$. These two results are special cases of our main theorems which concern biderivations and commuting linear maps having their ranges in an $L$-module. We provide a variety of examples, some of them showing the necessity of our assumptions and some of them showing that our results cover several results from the literature.;math.RA

1801.01145;Vectorial Boolean functions and linear codes in the context of algebraic attacks;In this paper we study the relationship between vectorial (Boolean) functions and cyclic codes in the context of algebraic attacks. We first derive a direct link between the annihilators of a vectorial function (in univariate form) and certain $2^{n}$-ary cyclic codes (which we prove that they are LCD codes) extending results due to R{\o}njom and Helleseth. The knowledge of the minimum distance of those codes gives rise to a lower bound on the algebraic immunity of the associated vectorial function. Furthermore, we solve an open question raised by Mesnager and Cohen. We also present some properties of those cyclic codes (whose generator polynomials determined by vectorial functions) as well as their weight enumerator. In addition we generalize the so-called algebraic complement and study its properties.;cs.IT

1801.01149;Graph switching, 2-ranks, and graphical Hadamard matrices;We study the behaviour of the 2-rank of the adjacency matrix of a graph under Seidel and Godsil-McKay switching, and apply the result to graphs coming from graphical Hadamard matrices of order $4^m$. Starting with graphs from known Hadamard matrices of order $64$, we find (by computer) many Godsil-McKay switching sets that increase the 2-rank. Thus we find strongly regular graphs with parameters $(63,32,16,16)$, $(64,36,20,20)$, and $(64,28,12,12)$ for almost all feasible 2-ranks. In addition we work out the behaviour of the 2-rank for a graph product related to the Kronecker product for Hadamard matrices, which enables us to find many graphical Hadamard matrices of order $4^m$ for which the related strongly regular graphs have an unbounded number of different 2-ranks. The paper extends results from the article 'Switched symplectic graphs and their 2-ranks' by the first and the last author.;math.CO
1801.01161;Spherical bodies of constant width;The intersection $L$ of two different non-opposite hemispheres $G$ and $H$ of a $d$-dimensional sphere $S^d$ is called a lune. By the thickness of $L$ we mean the distance of the centers of the $(d-1)$-dimensional hemispheres bounding $L$. For a hemisphere $G$ supporting a %spherical convex body $C \subset S^d$ we define ${\rm width}_G(C)$ as the thickness of the narrowest lune or lunes of the form $G \cap H$ containing $C$. If ${\rm width}_G(C) =w$ for every hemisphere $G$ supporting $C$, we say that $C$ is a body of constant width $w$. We present properties of these bodies. In particular, we prove that the diameter of any spherical body $C$ of constant width $w$ on $S^d$ is $w$, and that if $w &lt, \frac{\pi}{2}$, then $C$ is strictly convex. Moreover, we are checking when spherical bodies of constant width and constant diameter coincide.;math.MG
1801.01165;Automorphism groups and Ramsey properties of sparse graphs;We study automorphism groups of sparse graphs from the viewpoint of topological dynamics and the Kechris, Pestov, Todor\v{c}evi\'c correspondence. We investigate amenable and extremely amenable subgroups of these groups using the space of orientations of the graph and results from structural Ramsey theory. Resolving one of the open questions in the area, we show that Hrushovski's example of an $\omega$-categorical sparse graph has no $\omega$-categorical expansion with extremely amenable automorphism group.;math.GR
1801.01167;Random Kleinian Groups, II : Two parabolic generators;In earlier work we introduced geometrically natural probability measures on the group of all M\"obius transformations in order to study "random" groups of M\"obius transformations, random surfaces, and in particular random two-generator groups, that is groups where the generators are selected randomly, with a view to estimating the likely-hood that such groups are discrete and then to make calculations of the expectation of their associated parameters, geometry and topology. In this paper we continue that study and identify the precise probability that a Fuchsian group generated by two parabolic M\"obius transformations is discrete, and give estimates for the case of Kleinian groups generated by a pair of random parabolic elements which we support with a computational investigation into of the Riley slice as identified by Bowditch's condition, and establish rigorous bounds.;math.CV
1801.01170;Optimization-based AMP for Phase Retrieval: The Impact of Initialization and $\ell_2$-regularization;We consider an $\ell_2$-regularized non-convex optimization problem for recovering signals from their noisy phaseless observations. We design and study the performance of a message passing algorithm that aims to solve this optimization problem. We consider the asymptotic setting $m,n \rightarrow \infty$, $m/n \rightarrow \delta$ and obtain sharp performance bounds, where $m$ is the number of measurements and $n$ is the signal dimension. We show that for complex signals the algorithm can perform accurate recovery with only $m= \left(\frac{64}{\pi^2}-4\right)n \approx 2.5n$ measurements. Also, we provide sharp analysis on the sensitivity of the algorithm to noise. We highlight the following facts about our message passing algorithm: (i) Adding $\ell_2$ regularization to the non-convex loss function can be beneficial. (ii) Spectral initialization has marginal impact on the performance of the algorithm. The sharp analyses in this paper, not only enable us to compare the performance of our method with other phase recovery schemes, but also shed light on designing better iterative algorithms for other non-convex optimization problems.;cs.IT
1801.01184;A note on the problem of prisoners and hats;We study the famous mathematical puzzle of prisoners and hats.

1801.01186;Explicit expression for a family of ternary cyclotomic polynomials;In this paper, we give an explicit expression for a certain family of ternary cyclotomic polynomials: specifically $\Phi_{p_{1}p_{2}p_{3}}$, where $p_{1}&lt,p_{2}&lt,p_{3}$ are odd primes such that $p_{2} \equiv1 \mod p_{1}$ and $p_{3} \equiv1 \mod {p_{1}p_{2}}$. As an application of the explicit expressions, we give an exact formula for the number of nonzero terms in the polynomials in the family, which in turn immediately shows that the density (number of non-zeros terms / degree) is roughly inversely proportional to $p_{2}$, when $p_{1}$ is sufficiently large.;math.NT
1801.01187;The geometry of Gauss map and shape operator in simply isotropic and pseudo-isotropic spaces;In this work, we are interested in the differential geometry of surfaces in simply isotropic $\mathbb{I}^3$ and pseudo-isotropic $\mathbb{I}_{\mathrm{p}}^3$ spaces, which consists of the study of $\mathbb{R}^3$ equipped with a degenerate metric such as $\mathrm{d}s^2=\mathrm{d}x^2\pm\mathrm{d}y^2$. The investigation is based on previous results in the simply isotropic space [B. Pavkovi\'c, Glas. Mat. Ser. III $\mathbf{15}$, 149 (1980), Rad JAZU $\mathbf{450}$, 129 (1990)], which point to the possibility of introducing an isotropic Gauss map taking values on a unit sphere of parabolic type and of defining a shape operator from it, whose determinant and trace give the known relative Gaussian and mean curvatures, respectively. Based on the isotropic Gauss map, a new notion of connection is also introduced, the \emph{relative connection} (\emph{r-connection}, for short). We show that the new curvature tensor in both $\mathbb{I}^3$ and $\mathbb{I}_{\mathrm{p}}^3$ does not vanish identically and is directly related to the relative Gaussian curvature. We also compute the Gauss and Codazzi-Mainardi equations for the $r$-connection and show that $r$-geodesics on spheres of parabolic type are obtained via intersections with planes passing through their center (focus). Finally, we show that admissible pseudo-isotropic surfaces are timelike and that their shape operator may fail to be diagonalizable, in analogy to Lorentzian geometry. We also prove that the only totally umbilical surfaces in $\mathbb{I}_{\mathrm{p}}^3$ are planes and spheres of parabolic type and that, in contrast to the $r$-connection, the curvature tensor associated with the isotropic Levi-Civita connection vanishes identically for $any$ pseudo-isotropic surface, as also happens in simply isotropic space.;math.DG
1801.01188;A new proof of Raynaud-Gruson&#x27,s flattening theorem;We give a new proof of Raynaud-Gruson's theorem regarding flattening by blow-ups. The proof is direct, by working directly on the inverse limit of admissible blow-ups, which is a valuative space similar to the classical Zariski-Riemann space. These valuative spaces are defined in a broader context and always have an analogous flattening property: this yields a generalization of Raynaud-Gruson's theorem.;math.AG
1801.01189;Hasse-Witt matrices, unit roots and period integrals;Motivated by the work of Candelas, de la Ossa and Rodriguez-Villegas [6], we study the relations between Hasse-Witt matrices and period integrals of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in both toric varieties and partial flag varieties. We prove a conjecture by Vlasenko [23] on higher Hasse-Witt matrices for toric hypersurfaces following Katz's method of local expansion [14, 15]. The higher Hasse-Witt matrices also have close relation with period integrals. The proof gives a way to pass from Katz's congruence relations in terms of expansion coefficients [15] to Dwork's congruence relations [8] about periods.;math.AG
1801.01194;Period integrals of local complete intersections and tautological systems;Tautological systems developed in [6],[7] are Picard-Fuchs type systems to study period integrals of complete intersections in Fano varieties. We generalize tautological systems to local complete intersections, which are zero loci of global sections of vector bundles over Fano varieties. In particular, we obtain similar criterion as [6, 7] about holonomicity and regularity of the system. We also prove solution rank formulas and geometric realizations of solutions following the work of hypersurfaces [5, 4].;math.AG
1801.01201;Concurrent Implicit Spectral Deferred Correction Scheme for Low-Mach Number Combustion with Detailed Chemistry;We present a parallel implicit-explicit time integration scheme for the advection-diffusion-reaction systems arising from the equations governing low-Mach number combustion with complex chemistry. Our strategy employs parallelization across the method to accelerate the serial Multi-Implicit Spectral Deferred Correction (MISDC) scheme used to couple the advection, diffusion, and reaction processes. In our approach, referred to as Concurrent Implicit Spectral Deferred Correction (CISDC), the diffusion solves and the reaction solves are performed concurrently by different processors. Our analysis shows that the proposed parallel scheme is stable for stiff problems and that the sweeps converge to the fixed-point solution at a faster rate than with serial MISDC. We present numerical examples to demonstrate that the new algorithm is high-order accurate in time, and achieves a parallel speedup compared to serial MISDC.;math.NA
1801.01206;Radial basis function collocation method for decoupled fractional Laplacian wave equations;Decoupled fractional Laplacian wave equation can describe the seismic wave propagation in attenuating media. Fourier pseudospectral implementations, which solve the equation in spatial frequency domain, are the only existing methods for solving the equation. For the earth media with curved boundaries, the pseudospectral methods could be less attractive to handle the irregular computational domains. In the paper, we propose a radial basis function collocation method that can easily tackle the irregular domain problems. Unlike the pseudospectral methods, the proposed method solves the equation in physical variable domain. The directional fractional Laplacian is chosen from varied definitions of fractional Laplacian. Particularly, the vector Gr\"unwald-Letnikov formula is employed to approximate fractional directional derivative of radial basis function. The convergence and stability of the method are numerically investigated by using the synthetic solution and the long-time simulations, respectively. The method's flexibility is studied by considering homogeneous and multi-layer media having regular and irregular geometric boundaries.;math.NA
1801.01208;Binary Extended Formulations;We analyze different ways of constructing binary extended formulations of mixed-integer problems with bounded integer variables and compare their relative strength with respect to split cuts. We show that among all binary extended formulations where each bounded integer variable is represented by a distinct collection of binary variables, what we call "unimodular" extended formulations are the strongest. We also compare the strength of some binary extended formulations from the literature. Finally, we study the behavior of branch-and-bound on such extended formulations and show that branching on the new binary variables leads to significantly smaller enumeration trees in some cases.;math.OC
1801.01216;Absolutely compatible pairs in a von Neumann algebra;Let $a,b$ be elements in a unital C$^*$-algebra with $0\leq a,b\leq 1$. The element $a$ is absolutely compatible with $b$ if $$\vert a - b \vert + \vert 1 - a - b \vert = 1.$$ In this note we find some technical characterizations of absolutely compatible pairs in an arbitrary von Neumann algebra. These characterizations are applied to measure how close is a pair of absolute compatible positive elements in the closed unit ball from being orthogonal or commutative. In the case of 2 by 2 matrices the results offer a geometric interpretation in terms of an ellipsoid determined by one of the points. The conclusions for 2 by 2 matrices are also applied to describe absolutely compatible pairs of positive elements in the closed unit ball of $\mathbb{M}_n$.;math.OA
1801.01219;The distribution of overlaps between eigenvectors of Ginibre matrices;We study the overlaps between eigenvectors of nonnormal matrices. They quantify the stability of the spectrum, and characterize the joint eigenvalues increments under Dyson-type dynamics. Well known work by Chalker and Mehlig calculated the expectation of these overlaps for complex Ginibre matrices. For the same model, we extend their results by deriving the distribution of diagonal overlaps (the condition numbers), and their correlations. We prove: <br />(i) convergence of condition numbers for bulk eigenvalues to an inverse Gamma distribution, more generally, we decompose the quenched overlap (i.e. conditioned on eigenvalues) as a product of independent random variables, <br />(ii) asymptotic expectation of off-diagonal overlaps, both for microscopic or mesoscopic separation of the corresponding eigenvalues, <br />(iii) decorrelation of condition numbers associated to eigenvalues at mesoscopic distance, at polynomial speed in the dimension, <br />(iv) second moment asymptotics to identify the fluctuations order for off-diagonal overlaps, when the related eigenvalues are separated by any mesoscopic scale, <br />(v) a new formula for the correlation between overlaps for eigenvalues at microscopic distance, both diagonal and off-diagonal. <br />These results imply estimates on the extreme condition numbers, the volume of the pseudospectrum and the diffusive evolution of eigenvalues under Dyson-type dynamics, at equilibrium.;math.PR
1801.01221;Bounded-Velocity Stochastic Control for Dynamic Resource Allocation;We consider a general class of dynamic resource allocation problems within a stochastic optimal control framework. This class of problems arises in a wide variety of applications, each of which intrinsically involves resources of different types and demand with uncertainty and/or variability. The goal involves dynamically allocating capacity for every resource type in order to serve the uncertain/variable demand, modeled as Brownian motion, and maximize the discounted expected net-benefit over an infinite time horizon based on the rewards and costs associated with the different resource types, subject to flexibility constraints on the rate of change of each type of resource capacity. We derive the optimal control policy within a bounded-velocity stochastic control setting, which includes efficient and easily implementable algorithms for governing the dynamic adjustments to resource allocation capacities over time. Computational experiments investigate various issues of both theoretical and practical interest, quantifying the benefits of our approach over recent alternative optimization approaches.;math.OC

1801.01236;Multistep Neural Networks for Data-driven Discovery of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems;The process of transforming observed data into predictive mathematical models of the physical world has always been paramount in science and engineering. Although data is currently being collected at an ever-increasing pace, devising meaningful models out of such observations in an automated fashion still remains an open problem. In this work, we put forth a machine learning approach for identifying nonlinear dynamical systems from data. Specifically, we blend classical tools from numerical analysis, namely the multi-step time-stepping schemes, with powerful nonlinear function approximators, namely deep neural networks, to distill the mechanisms that govern the evolution of a given data-set. We test the effectiveness of our approach for several benchmark problems involving the identification of complex, nonlinear and chaotic dynamics, and we demonstrate how this allows us to accurately learn the dynamics, forecast future states, and identify basins of attraction. In particular, we study the Lorenz system, the fluid flow behind a cylinder, the Hopf bifurcation, and the Glycoltic oscillator model as an example of complicated nonlinear dynamics typical of biological systems.;math.DS
1801.01238;Topological Entropy for Discontinuous Semiflows;We study two variations of Bowen's definitions of topological entropy based on separated and spanning sets which can be applied to the study of discontinuous semiflows on compact metric spaces. We prove that these definitions reduce to Bowen's ones in the case of continuous semiflows. As a second result, we prove that our entropies give a lower bound for the $\tau$-entropy defined by Alves, Carvalho and V\'asquez (2015). Finally, we prove that for impulsive semiflows satisfying certain regularity condition, there exists a continuous semiflow defined on another compact metric space which is related to the first one by a semiconjugation, and whose topological entropy equals our extended notion of topological entropy by using separated sets for the original semiflow.;math.DS
1801.01240;The distance to square-free polynomials;In this paper, we consider a variant of Tur\'an's problem on the distance from an integer polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ to the nea\-rest irreducible polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$. We prove that for any polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$, there exist infinitely many square-free polynomials $g\in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ such that $L(f-g) \le 2$, where $L(f-g)$ denotes the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of $f-g$. On the other hand, we show that this inequality cannot be replaced by $L(f-g) \le 1$. For this, for each integer $d \geq 16$ we construct infinitely many polynomials $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ of degree $d$ such that neither $f$ itself nor any $f(x) \pm x^k$, where $k$ is a non-negative integer, is square-free. Polynomials over prime fields and their distances to square-free polynomials are also considered.;math.NT
1801.01241;On the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in presence of a background shear;In this note we revisit the classical subject of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in presence of an incompressible background shear flow. We derive a formula for the essential spectral radius of the evolution group generated by the linearization near the steady state and reveal that the velocity variations neutralize shortwave instabilities. The formula is a direct generalization of the result of H. J. Hwang and Y. Guo in the hydrostatic case \cite{HG}. Furthermore, we construct a class of steady states which posses unstable discrete spectrum with neutral essential spectrum. The technique involves the WKB analysis of the evolution equation and contains novel compactness criterion for pseudo-differential operators on unbounded domains.;math.AP
1801.01249;Cooperative Ambient Backscatter Communications for Green Internet-of-Things;Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables a passive backscatter device to transmit information to a reader using ambient RF signals, and has emerged as a promising solution to green Internet-of-Things (IoT). Conventional AmBC receivers are interested in recovering the information from the ambient backscatter device (A-BD) only. In this paper, we propose a cooperative AmBC (CABC) system in which the reader recovers information not only from the A-BD, but also from the RF source. We first establish the system model for the CABC system from spread spectrum and spectrum sharing perspectives. Then, for flat fading channels, we derive the optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) detector, suboptimal linear detectors as well as successive interference-cancellation (SIC) based detectors. For frequency-selective fading channels, the system model for the CABC system over ambient orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) carriers is proposed, upon which a low-complexity optimal ML detector is derived. For both kinds of channels, the bit-error-rate (BER) expressions for the proposed detectors are derived in closed forms. Finally, extensive numerical results have shown that, when the A-BD signal and the RF-source signal have equal symbol period, the proposed SIC-based detectors can achieve near-ML detection performance for typical application scenarios, and when the A-BD symbol period is longer than the RF-source symbol period, the existence of backscattered signal in the CABC system can enhance the ML detection performance of the RF-source signal, thanks to the beneficial effect of the backscatter link when the A-BD transmits at a lower rate than the RF source.;cs.IT
1801.01251;Period integral of open Fermat surfaces and special values of hypergeometric functions;In the previous paper by Asakura-Otsubo-Terasoma, we prove that the special values of the hypergeometric function 3F2 at 1 are linear combinations of logarithms of algebraic numbers and 1 over algebraic numbers, if exponents are rational numbers satisfying a certain arithmetic condition. Aoki and Shioda completely classified these sets of rational numbers satisfying this condition in connection with Hodge cycles on Fermat surfaces. In this paper, we give an explicit expression of special values of hypergoemetricy 3F2 which does not belong to exceptional characters.;math.AG
1801.01252;A linearized energy preserving finite element method for the dynamical incompressible magnetohydrodynamics equations;We present and analyze a linearized finite element method (FEM) for the dynamical incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The finite element approximation is based on mixed conforming elements, where Taylor--Hood type elements are used for the Navier--Stokes equations and Nedelec edge elements are used for the magnetic equation. The divergence free conditions are weakly satisfied at the discrete level. Due to the use of Nedelec edge element, the proposed method is particularly suitable for problems defined on non-smooth and multi-connected domains. For the temporal discretization, we use a linearized scheme which only needs to solve a linear system at each time step. Moreover, the linearized mixed FEM is energy preserving. We establish an optimal error estimate under a very low assumption on the exact solutions and domain geometries. Numerical results which includes a benchmark lid-driven cavity problem are provided to show its effectiveness and verify the theoretical analysis.;math.NA
1801.01256;A scaling limit from the wave map to the heat flow into $\mathbb{S}^2$;In this paper we study a limit connecting a scaled wave map with the heat flow into the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$. We show quantitatively how that the two equations are connected by means of an initial layer correction. This limit is motivated as a first step into understanding the limit of zero inertia for the hyperbolic-parabolic Ericksen-Leslie's liquid crystal model.;math.AP
1801.01265;Improved Bounds on Lossless Source Coding and Guessing Moments via R&#xe9,nyi Measures;This paper provides upper and lower bounds on the optimal guessing moments of a random variable taking values on a finite set when side information may be available. These moments quantify the number of guesses required for correctly identifying the unknown object and, similarly to Arikan's bounds, they are expressed in terms of the Arimoto-R\'enyi conditional entropy. Although Arikan's bounds are asymptotically tight, the improvement of the bounds in this paper is significant in the non-asymptotic regime. Relationships between moments of the optimal guessing function and the MAP error probability are also established, characterizing the exact locus of their attainable values. The bounds on optimal guessing moments serve to improve non-asymptotic bounds on the cumulant generating function of the codeword lengths for fixed-to-variable optimal lossless source coding without prefix constraints. Non-asymptotic bounds on the reliability function of discrete memoryless sources are derived as well. Relying on these techniques, lower bounds on the cumulant generating function of the codeword lengths are derived, by means of the smooth R\'enyi entropy, for source codes that allow decoding errors.;cs.IT
1801.01268;Asymptotic Faithfulness of Quantum $\mathrm{Sp}(4)$ Mapping Class Group Representations;We prove asymptotic faithfulness for the quantum $\mathrm{Sp}(4)$ mapping class group representation. This provides the first example of asymptotic faithfulness lying outside of the $A_n$ family. The methods used are generalized from the proof of asymptotic faithfulness for skein $SU(2)_k$ mapping class group representations. In short, for any noncentral mapping class a comparison vector is found which allows for the mapping class to be detected.;math.QA
1801.01270;Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Wireless Communication: Tail, Risk and Scale;Ensuring ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) for 5G wireless networks and beyond is of capital importance and is currently receiving tremendous attention in academia and industry. At its core, URLLC mandates a departure from expected utility-based network design approaches, in which relying on average quantities (e.g., average throughput, average delay and average response time) is no longer an option but a necessity. Instead, a principled and scalable framework which takes into account delay, reliability, packet size, network architecture, and topology (across access, edge, and core) and decision-making under uncertainty is sorely lacking. The overarching goal of this article is a first step to fill this void. Towards this vision, after providing definitions of latency and reliability, we closely examine various enablers of URLLC and their inherent tradeoffs. Subsequently, we focus our attention on a plethora of techniques and methodologies pertaining to the requirements of ultra-reliable and low-latency communication, as well as their applications through selected use cases. These results provide crisp insights for the design of low-latency and high-reliable wireless networks.;cs.IT
1801.01271;On division subrings normalized by almost subnormal subgroups in division rings;Let $D$ be a division ring with infinite center, $K$ a proper division subring of $D$ and $N$ an almost subnormal subgroup of the multiplicative group $D^*$ of $D$. The aim of this paper is to show that if $K$ is $N$-invariant and $N$ is non-central, then $K$ is central. Some examples of almost subnormal subgroups in division rings that are not subnormal are also given.;math.RA
1801.01282;Minimal convex majorants of functions and Demyanov--Rubinov super(sub)differentials;The primary goal of the paper is to establish characteristic properties of (extended) real-valued functions defined on normed vector spaces that admit the representation as the lower envelope of their minimal (with respect to pointwise ordering) convex majorants. The results presented in the paper generalize and extend the well-known Demyanov-Rubinov characterization of upper semicontinuous positively homogeneous functions as the lower envelope of exhaustive families of continuous sublinear functions to more larger classes of (not necessarily positively homogeneous) functions defined on arbitrary normed spaces. As applications of the above results, we introduce, for nonsmooth functions, a new notion of the Demyanov-Rubinov subdifferential at a given point, and show that it generalizes a number of known notions of subdifferentiability, in particular, the Fenchel-Moreau subdifferential of convex functions and the Dini-Hadamard (directional) subdifferential of directionally differentiable functions. Some applications of Demyanov-Rubinov subdifferentials to extremal problems are considered.;math.OC
1801.01283;Recursive combinatorial aspects of compactified moduli spaces;A connection between moduli spaces of algebro-geometric objects and moduli spaces of polyhedral objects has been under investigation in recent years. Loosely speaking, the skeleton of an algebro-geometric moduli space is expressed as the modul space of the skeleta of the objects it parametrizes. The connection is based on the combinatorial properties of the boundary of the algebro-geometric moduli spaces. This paper overviews this topic with focus on moduli of curves, admissible covers, Jacobians and their Neron models.;math.AG
1801.01284;Ergodic BSDE with an unbounded and multiplicative underlying diffusion and application to large time behavior of viscosity solution of HJB equation;In this paper, we study ergodic backward stochastic differential equations (EBSDEs for short), for which the underlying diffusion is assumed to be multiplicative and of at most linear growth. The fact that the forward process has an unbounded diffusion is balanced with an assumption of weak dissipativity for its drift. Moreover, the forward equation is assumed to be non-degenerate. Like in [HMR15], we show that the solution of a BSDE in finite horizon T behaves basically as a linear function of T, with a shift depending on the solution of the associated EBSDE, with an explicit rate of convergence. Finally, we apply our results to an ergodic optimal control problem. In particular, we show the large time behaviour of viscosity solution of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation with an exponential rate of convergence when the undelrying diffusion is multiplicative and unbounded.;math.PR
1801.01289;On sums of squares of $|&#x3b6,(\frac12+i&#x3b3,)|$ over short intervals;A discussion involving the evaluation of the sum $$\sum_{T&lt,\g\le T+H}|\zeta(1/2+i\gamma)|^2$$ and some related integrals is presented, where $\gamma\,(&gt,0)$ denotes imaginary parts of complex zeros of the Riemann zeta-function $\zeta(s)$. It is shown unconditionally that the above sum is $\,\ll H\log^2T\log\log T\,$ for $\,T^{2/3}\log^4T \ll H \le T$.;math.NT
1801.01292;Generic distance-squared mappings on plane curves;A distance-squared function is one of the most significant functions in the application of singularity theory to differential geometry. Moreover, distance-squared mappings are naturally extended mappings of distance-squared functions, wherein each component is a distance-squared function. In this paper, compositions of a given plane curve and generic distance-squared mappings on the plane into the plane are investigated from the viewpoint of stability.;math.DG
1801.01297;Another refinement of the right-hand side of the Hermite-Hadamard inequality for simplices;In this paper, we establish a new refinement of the right-hand side of Hermite-Hadamard inequality for convex functions of several variables defined on simplices.;math.CA
1801.01300;Heat and entropy flows in Carnot groups;We prove the correspondence between the solutions of the sub-elliptic heat equation in a Carnot group $\mathbb{G}$ and the gradient flows of the relative entropy functional in the Wasserstein space of probability measures on $\mathbb{G}$. Our result completely answers a question left open in a previous paper by N. Juillet, where the same correspondence was proved for $\mathbb{G}=\mathbb{H}^n$, the $n$-dimensional Heisenberg group.;math.DG
1801.01302;Isoperimetric rigidity and distributions of 1-Lipschitz functions;We prove that if a geodesic metric measure space satisfies a comparison condition for isoperimetric profile and if the observable variance is maximal, then the space is foliated by minimal geodesics, where the observable variance is defined to be the supremum of the variance of 1-Lipschitz functions on the space. Our result can be considered as a variant of Cheeger-Gromoll's splitting theorem and also of Cheng's maximal diameter theorem. As an application, we obtain a new isometric splitting theorem for a complete weighted Riemannian manifold with a positive Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature.;math.MG
1801.01309;The mathematics of asymptotic stability in the Kuramoto model;Now a standard in Nonlinear Sciences, the Kuramoto model is the perfect example of the transition to synchrony in heterogeneous systems of coupled oscillators. While its basic phenomenology has been sketched in early works, the corresponding rigorous validation has long remained problematic and was achieved only recently. This paper reviews the mathematical results on asymptotic stability of stationary solutions in the continuum limit of the Kuramoto model, and provides insights into the principal arguments of proofs. This review is complemented with additional original results, various examples, and possible extensions to some variations of the model in the literature.;math.AP
1801.01310;Validity of Borodin and Kostochka Conjecture for {4 Times K1}-free Graphs;Problem of finding an optimal upper bound for the chromatic no. of even 3K1-free graphs is still open and pretty hard. Here we prove Borodin &amp, Kostochka Conjecture for 4K1-free graphs G i.e. If maximum degree of a {4 Times K1}-free graph is greater than or equal to 9, then the chromatic number of the graph is less than or equal to maximum of {\omega} and {\delta-1}.;math.CO
1801.01313;Thinplate Splines on the Sphere;In this paper we give explicit closed forms for the semi-reproducing kernels associated with thinplate spline interpolation on the sphere. Polyharmonic or thinplate splines for ${\mathbb R}^d$ were introduced by Duchon and have become a widely used tool in myriad applications. The analogues for ${\mathbb S}^{d-1}$ are the thin plate splines for the sphere. The topic was first discussed by Wahba in the early 1980's, for the ${\mathbb S}^2$ case. Wahba presented the associated semi-reproducing kernels as infinite series. These semi-reproducing kernels play a central role in expressions for the solution of the associated spline interpolation and smoothing problems. The main aims of the current paper are to give a recurrence for the semi-reproducing kernels, and also to use the recurrence to obtain explicit closed form expressions for many of these kernels. The closed form expressions will in many cases be significantly faster to evaluate than the series expansions. This will enhance the practicality of using these thinplate splines for the sphere in computations.;math.CA
1801.01318;S-regular functions which preserve a complex slice;We study global properties of quaternionic slice regular functions (also called s-regular) defined on symmetric slice domains. In particular, thanks to new techniques and points of view, we can characterize the property of being one-slice preserving in terms of the projectivization of the vectorial part of the function. We also define a "Hermitian" product on slice regular functions which gives us the possibility to express the $*$-product of two s-regular functions in terms of the scalar product of suitable functions constructed starting from $f$ and $g$. Afterwards we are able to determine, under different assumptions, when the sum, the $*$-product and the $*$-conjugation of two slice regular functions preserve a complex slice. We also study when the $*$-power of a slice regular function has this property or when it preserves all complex slices. To obtain these results we prove two factorization theorems: in the first one, we are able to split a slice regular function into the product of two functions: one keeping track of the zeroes and the other which is never-vanishing, in the other one we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a slice regular function (which preserves all complex slices) to be the symmetrized of a suitable slice regular one.;math.CV
1801.01327;Frobenius Theorem in Banach Space;Let $\Lambda$ be an open set in Banach space $E$, $M(x)$ for $x\in \Lambda$ a subspace in $E$, and $\mathcal F=\{M(x)\}_{x\in\Lambda}$. In this paper, we introduce the concept of the co-final set $J(x_0,E_*)$ for $\mathcal F$ at $x_0\in \Lambda$, then prove Frobenius theorem in Banach space where especially, $\mathrm{dim}\, M(x)$ maybe $\infty$. Using the Frobenius theorem, we prove a theorem in advanced calulus that presents several $c^1$ integrable family $\mathcal F$ at a point with $\mathrm{dim}\, M(x) =\infty$ and trivial co-final set. Let $\Lambda=B(E,F)\setminus\{0\},\ M(X)=\{T\in B(E,F) : TN(X)\subset R(X)\}$, and $\mathcal F=\{M(X)\}_{X\in\Lambda}$. The following theorem is proved using Frobenius theorem: if $A\in\Lambda$ is double splitting, then $\mathcal F$ at $A$ is smooth integrable where $J(A,E_*)$ is non-trivial in general. Specially we have the global result as follows, let $\Phi$ be any one of $F_k(k&lt,\infty)$ and $\Phi_{m,n}(\min\{m,n\}&lt,\infty)$, then $\Phi$ is smooth submanifold in $B(E,F)$ and tangent to $M(X)$ at any $X$ in $\Phi$.;math.FA
1801.01328;Schurity and separability of quasiregular coherent configurations;A permutation group is said to be quasiregular if every its transitive constituent is regular, and a quasiregular coherent configuration can be thought as a combinatorial analog of such a group: the transitive constituents are replaced by the homogeneous components. In this paper, we are interested in the question when the configuration is schurian, i.e., formed by the orbitals of a permutation group, or/and separable, i.e., uniquely determined by the intersection numbers. In these terms, an old result of Hanna Neumann is, in a sense, dual to the statement that the quasiregular coherent configurations with cyclic homogeneous components are schurian. In the present paper, we (a) establish the duality in a precise form and (b) generalize the latter result by proving that a quasiregular coherent configuration is schurian and separable if the groups associated with homogeneous components have distributive lattices of normal subgroups.;math.CO
1801.01329;Bounded normal generation is not equivalent to topological bounded normal generation;We show that some derived $\mathrm{L}^1$ full groups provide examples of non simple Polish groups with the topological bounded normal generation property. In particular, it follows that there are Polish groups with the topological bounded normal generation property but not the bounded normal generation property.;math.GR

1801.01336;A family of multigraphs with large palette index;Given a proper edge-coloring of a loopless multigraph, the palette of a vertex is defined as the set of colors of the edges which are incident with it. The palette index of a multigraph is defined as the minimum number of distinct palettes occurring among the vertices, taken over all proper edge-colorings of the multigraph itself. In this framework, the palette multigraph of an edge-colored multigraph is defined in this paper and some of its properties are investigated. We show that these properties can be applied in a natural way in order to produce the first known family of multigraphs whose palette index is expressed in terms of the maximum degree by a quadratic polynomial. We also attempt an analysis of our result in connection with some related questions.;math.CO
1801.01338;Quantitative aspects of the rigidity of branching microstructures in shape memory alloys via H-measures;We quantify the rigidity of branching microstructures in shape memory alloys undergoing cubic-to-tetragonal transformations in the geometrically linearized theory by making use of Tartar's H-measures. The main result is a $B^{2/3}_{1,\infty}$-estimate for the characteristic functions of twins, which heuristically suggests that the larger-scale interfaces can cluster on a set of Hausdorff-dimension $3-\frac{2}{3}$. We provide evidence indicating that the dimension is optimal. Furthermore, we get an essentially local lower bound for the blow-up behavior of the limiting energy density close to a habit plane.;math.AP
1801.01339;On the application of the Lindstedt-Poincar&#xe9, method to the Lotka-Volterra system;We apply the Lindstedt-Poincar\'{e} method to the Lotka-Volterra model and discuss alternative implementations of the approach. By means of an efficient systematic algorithm we obtain an unprecedented number of perturbation corrections for the two dynamical variables and the frequency. They enable us to estimate the radius of convergence of the perturbation series for the frequency as a function of the only model parameter. The method is suitable for the treatment of systems with any number of dynamical variables.;math-ph
1801.01340;Random time step probabilistic methods for uncertainty quantification in chaotic and geometric numerical integration;A novel probabilistic numerical method for quantifying the uncertainty induced by the time integration of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is introduced. Departing from the classical strategy to randomize ODE solvers by adding a random forcing term, we show that a probability measure over the numerical solution of ODEs can be obtained by introducing suitable random time-steps in a classical time integrator. This intrinsic randomization allows for the conservation of geometric properties of the underlying deterministic integrator such as mass conservation, symplecticity or conservation of first integrals. Weak and mean-square convergence analysis are derived. We also analyse the convergence of the Monte Carlo estimator for the proposed random time step method and show that the measure obtained with repeated sampling converges in the mean-square sense independently of the number of samples. Numerical examples including chaotic Hamiltonian systems, chemical reactions and Bayesian inferential problems illustrate the accuracy, robustness and versatility of our probabilistic numerical method.;math.NA
1801.01345;De Branges spaces and Fock spaces;Relations between two classes of Hilbert spaces of entire functions, de Branges spaces and Fock-type spaces with non-radial weights, are studied. It is shown that any de Branges space can be realized as a Fock-type space with equivalent area norm, and several constructions of a representing weight are suggested. For some special classes of weights (e.g., weights depending on the imaginary part only) the corresponding de Branges spaces are explicitly described.;math.CV
1801.01346;Spectral properties of 2D Pauli operators with almost periodic electromagnetic fields;We consider a 2D Pauli operator with almost periodic field $b$ and electric potential $V$. First, we study the ergodic properties of $H$ and show, in particular, that its discrete spectrum is empty if there exists a magnetic potential which generates the magnetic field $b - b_{0}$, $b_{0}$ being the mean value of $b$. Next, we assume that $V = 0$, and investigate the zero modes of $H$. As expected, if $b_{0} \neq 0$, then generically $\operatorname{dim} \operatorname{Ker} H = \infty$. If $b_{0} = 0$, then for each $m \in {\mathbb N} \cup \{ \infty \}$, we construct almost periodic $b$ such that $\operatorname{dim} \operatorname{Ker} H = m$. This construction depends strongly on results concerning the asymptotic behavior of Dirichlet series, also obtained in the present article.;math.SP
1801.01347;Metaplectic Eisenstein Distributions;In this paper, we define distributional analogues of the metaplectic Eisenstein series for $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$, which we refer to as metaplectic Eisenstein distributions. We prove that these distributions have meromorphic continuation and give an explicit functional equation that they satisfy. From these results, we deduce the functional equation for the corresponding classical metaplectic Eisenstein series.;math.NT
1801.01352;Two-phase heat conductors with a surface of the constant flow property;We consider a two-phase heat conductor in $\mathbb R^N$ with $N \geq 2$ consisting of a core and a shell with different constant conductivities. We study the role played by radial symmetry for overdetermined problems of elliptic and parabolic type. First of all, with the aid of the implicit function theorem, we give a counterexample to radial symmetry for some two-phase elliptic overdetermined boundary value problems of Serrin-type. Afterwards, we consider the following setting for a two-phase parabolic overdetermined problem. We suppose that, initially, the conductor has temperature 0 and, at all times, its boundary is kept at temperature 1. A hypersurface in the domain has the constant flow property if at every of its points the heat flux across surface only depends on time. It is shown that the structure of the conductor must be spherical, if either there is a surface of the constant flow property in the shell near the boundary or a connected component of the boundary of the heat conductor is a surface of the constant flow property. Also, by assuming that the medium outside the conductor has a possibly different conductivity, we consider a Cauchy problem in which the conductor has initial inside temperature $0$ and outside temperature $1$. We then show that a quite similar symmetry result holds true.;math.AP
1801.01354;Ekedahl-Oort stratifications of Shimura varieties via Breuil-Kisin windows;Let $ S $ be the special fibre of the good reduction of a Shimura variety of Hodge type. By constructing adapted deformations for the associated $p$-divisible groups of $ S $, we manage to construct a morphism from $S$ to some quotient sheaf of the loop group associated with $S$. We show that the geometric fibres of this morphism give back the Ekedahl-Oort strata of $S$. For any geometric point $ x $ of $ S $, we give a deformation over $ W(k(x)) $ of the $ p $-divisible group associated with $ x $ by (non-canonically) constructing a Breuil-Kisin window (which corresponds to a $ p $-divisible group over $ W(k(x)) $ by the work of Kisin). This map in a sense gives a conceptual interpretation of Viehmann's new invariants "truncations of level one of elements in the loop group".;math.AG
1801.01360;Minimal Representations of Natural Numbers Under a Set of Operators;This paper studies the minimal length representation of the natural numbers. Let O be a fixed set of integer-valued functions (primarily hyperoperations). For each n, what is the shortest way of expressing n as a combinations of functions in O to the constant 1? For example, if O contains the two functions Sx (successor of x) and *xy (x times y) then the shortest representation of 12 is *SSS1SS1, with 8 symbols. This is taken to mean that 8 is complexity of 12 under O. We make a study of such minimal representations and complexities in this paper, proving and/or rightly predicting bounds on complexities, discussing some relevant patterns in the complexities and minimal representations of the natural numbers and listing the results gleaned from computational analysis. Computationally, the first 4.5 million natural numbers were probed to verify our mathematically obtained results. Due to the finiteness of the problem, we used the method of exhaustion of possibilities to state some other results as well.;math.HO

In this paper, the author considers the complete continuity on weighted $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ spaces with $A_p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ weights, weighted Morrey spaces with $A_p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ weights, for the commutator generated by ${\rm CMO}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ functions and $\mathcal{M}_{\Omega}$ when $\Omega$ satisfies certain size conditions.;math.CA
1801.01368;A simple property of the Weyl tensor for a shear, vorticity and acceleration-free velocity field;We prove that, in a space-time of dimension n&gt,3 with a velocity field that is shear-free, vorticity-free and acceleration-free, the covariant divergence of the Weyl tensor is zero if the contraction of the Weyl tensor with the velocity is zero. The other way, if the covariant divergence of the Weyl tensor is zero, then the contraction of the Weyl tensor with the velocity has recurrent geodesic derivative. This partly extends a property found in Generalised Robertson-Walker spacetimes, where the velocity is also eigenvector of the Ricci tensor. Despite the simplicity of the statement, the proof is involved. As a product of the same calculation, we introduce a curvature tensor with an interesting recurrence property.;math-ph

1801.01380;The cost of controlling strongly degenerate parabolic equations;We consider the typical one-dimensional strongly degenerate parabolic operator $Pu= u_t - (x^\alpha u_x)_x$ with $0&lt,x&lt,\ell$ and $\alpha\in(0,2)$, controlled either by a boundary control acting at $x=\ell$, or by a locally distributed control. Our main goal is to study the dependence of the so-called controllability cost needed to drive an initial condition to rest with respect to the degeneracy parameter $\alpha$. We prove that the control cost blows up with an explicit exponential rate, as $e^{C/((2-\alpha)^2 T)}$, when $\alpha \to 2^-$ and/or $T\to 0^+$. <br />Our analysis builds on earlier results and methods (based on functional analysis and complex analysis techniques) developed by several authors such as Fattorini-Russel, Seidman, G\"uichal, Tenenbaum-Tucsnak and Lissy for the classical heat equation. In particular, we use the moment method and related constructions of suitable biorthogonal families, as well as new fine properties of the Bessel functions $J_\nu$ of large order $\nu$ (obtained by ordinary differential equations techniques).;math.OC
1801.01381;Graph Homologies and Functoriality;We follow the same technics we used before in \cite{AZ} of extending knot Floer homology to embedded graphs in a 3-manifold, by using the Kauffman topological invariant of embedded graphs by associating family of links and knots to a such graph by using some local replacements at each vertex in the graph. This new concept of Graph Floer homology constructed to be the sum of the knot Floer homologies of all the links and knots associated to this graph and the Euler characteristic is the sum of all the Alexander polynomials of links in the family. We constructed three pre-additive categories one for the graph under the cobordism and the other one is constructed in \cite{AMM} the last one is a category of Floer homologies for graph defined by Kauffman. Then we trying to study the functoriality of graphs category and their graph homologies in two ways, under cobordism and under branched cover, then we try to find the compatibility between them by the idea of Hilden and Little \cite{HL} by giving a notion of equivalence relation of branched coverings obtained by using cobordisms, and hence define a a functor from the graph Floer-Kauffman Homology category to the graph Khovanov-Kauffman Homology category.;math.AT
1801.01382;Logarithmic Bose-Einstein condensates with harmonic potential;In this paper, by using a compactness method, we study the Cauchy problem of the logarithmic Schr\"{o}dinger equation with harmonic potential. We then address the existence of ground states solutions as minimizers of the action on the Nehari manifold. Finally, we explicitly compute ground states (Gausson-type solution) and we show their orbital stability.;math.AP
1801.01384;Holomorphic Structure of Middle Bol Loops;A loop $(Q,\cdot,\backslash,/)$ is called a middle Bol loop if it obeys the identity $x(yz\backslash x)=(x/z)(y\backslash x)$. To every right (left) Bol loop corresponds a middle Bol loop via an isostrophism. In this paper, the structure of the holomorph of a middle Bol loop is explored. For some special types of automorphisms, the holomorph of a commutative loop is shown to be a commutative middle Bol loop if and only if the loop is a middle Bol loop and its automorphism group is abelian and a subgroup of both the group of middle regular mappings and the right multiplication group. It was found that commutativity (flexibility) is a necessary and sufficient condition for holomorphic invariance under the existing isostrophy between middle Bol loops and the corresponding right (left) Bol loops. The right combined holomorph of a middle Bol loop and its corresponding right (left) Bol loop was shown to be equal to the holomorph of the middle Bol loop if and only if the automorphism group is abelian and a subgroup of the multiplication group of the middle Bol loop. The obedience of an identity dependent on automorphisms was found to be a necessary and sufficient condition the left combined holomorph of a middle Bol loop and its corresponding left Bol loop to be equal to the holomorph of the middle Bol loop.;math.GR
1801.01386;On Enriched Fibrations;We introduce the notion of an enriched fibration, i.e. a fibration whose total category and base category are enriched in those of a monoidal fibration in an appropriate way. Furthermore, we provide a way to obtain such a structure, starting from actions of monoidal categories with parameterized adjoints. The motivating goal is to capture certain example cases, like the fibration of modules over algebras enriched in the opfibration of comodules over coalgebras.;math.CT
1801.01389;Bogoliubov Theory in the Gross-Pitaevskii Limit;We consider Bose gases consisting of $N$ particles trapped in a box with volume one and interacting through a repulsive potential with scattering length of the order $N^{-1}$(Gross-Pitaevskii regime). We determine the ground state energy and the low-energy excitation spectrum, up to errors vanishing as $N \to \infty$. Our results confirm Bogoliubov's predictions.;math-ph
1801.01392;Lebesgue type decompositions for linear relations and Ando&#x27,s uniqueness criterion;A linear relation, i.e., a multivalued operator $T$ from a Hilbert space ${\mathfrak H}$ to a Hilbert space ${\mathfrak K}$ has Lebesgue type decompositions $T=T_{1}+T_{2}$, where $T_{1}$ is a closable operator and $T_{2}$ is an operator or relation which is singular. There is one canonical decomposition, called the Lebesgue decomposition of $T$, whose closable part is characterized by its maximality among all closable parts in the sense of domination. All Lebesgue type decompositions are parametrized, which also leads to necessary and sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of such decompositions. Similar results are given for weak Lebesgue type decompositions, where $T_1$ is just an operator without being necessarily closable. Moreover, closability is characterized in different useful ways. In the special case of range space relations the above decompositions may be applied when dealing with pairs of (nonnegative) bounded operators and nonnegative forms as well as in the classical framework of positive measures.;math.FA
1801.01393;Codegree Tur&#xe1,n density of complete $r$-uniform hypergraphs;Let $r\ge 3$. Given an $r$-graph $H$, the minimum codegree $\delta_{r-1}(H)$ is the largest integer $t$ such that every $(r-1)$-subset of $V(H)$ is contained in at least $t$ edges of $H$. Given an $r$-graph $F$, the codegree Tur\'an density $\gamma(F)$ is the smallest $\gamma &gt,0$ such that every $r$-graph on $n$ vertices with $\delta_{r-1}(H)\ge (\gamma + o(1))n$ contains $F$ as a subhypergraph. Using results on the independence number of hypergraphs, we show that there are constants $c_1, c_2&gt,0$ depending only on $r$ such that \[ 1 - c_2 \frac{\ln t}{t^{r-1}} \le \gamma(K_t^r) \le 1 - c_1 \frac{\ln t}{t^{r-1}}, \] where $K_t^r$ is the complete $r$-graph on $t$ vertices. This gives the best general bounds for $\gamma(K_t^r)$.;math.CO
1801.01394;Prediction Error Bounds for Linear Regression With the TREX;The TREX is a recently introduced approach to sparse linear regression. In contrast to most well-known approaches to penalized regression, the TREX can be formulated without the use of tuning parameters. In this paper, we establish the first known prediction error bounds for the TREX. Additionally, we introduce extensions of the TREX to a more general class of penalties, and we provide a bound on the prediction error in this generalized setting. These results deepen the understanding of TREX from a theoretical perspective and provide new insights into penalized regression in general.;math.ST
1801.01412;Operator scaling with specified marginals;The completely positive maps, a generalization of the nonnegative matrices, are a well-studied class of maps from $n\times n$ matrices to $m\times m$ matrices. The existence of the operator analogues of doubly stochastic scalings of matrices is equivalent to a multitude of problems in computer science and mathematics, such rational identity testing in non-commuting variables, noncommutative rank of symbolic matrices, and a basic problem in invariant theory (Garg, Gurvits, Oliveira and Wigderson, FOCS, 2016). <br />We study operator scaling with specified marginals, which is the operator analogue of scaling matrices to specified row and column sums. We characterize the operators which can be scaled to given marginals, much in the spirit of the Gurvits' algorithmic characterization of the operators that can be scaled to doubly stochastic (Gurvits, Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 2004). Our algorithm produces approximate scalings in time poly(n,m) whenever scalings exist. A central ingredient in our analysis is a reduction from the specified marginals setting to the doubly stochastic setting. <br />Operator scaling with specified marginals arises in diverse areas of study such as the Brascamp-Lieb inequalities, communication complexity, eigenvalues of sums of Hermitian matrices, and quantum information theory. Some of the known theorems in these areas, several of which had no effective proof, are straightforward consequences of our characterization theorem. For instance, we obtain a simple algorithm to find, when they exist, a tuple of Hermitian matrices with given spectra whose sum has a given spectrum. We also prove new theorems such as a generalization of Forster's theorem (Forster, Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 2002) concerning radial isotropic position.;math.CO
1801.01417;Minimization of the eigenvalues of the dirichlet-laplacian with a diameter constraint;In this paper we look for the domains minimizing the h-th eigenvalue of the Dirichlet-Laplacian $\lambda$ h with a constraint on the diameter. Existence of an optimal domain is easily obtained, and is attained at a constant width body. In the case of a simple eigenvalue, we provide non standard (i.e., non local) optimality conditions. Then we address the question whether or not the disk is an optimal domain in the plane, and we give the precise list of the 17 eigenvalues for which the disk is a local minimum. We conclude by some numerical simulations showing the 20 first optimal domains in the plane.;math.AP
1801.01418;Quantitative estimates for bending energies and applications to non-local variational problems;We discuss a variational model, given by a weighted sum of perimeter, bending and Riesz interaction energies, that could be considered as a toy model for charged elastic drops. The different contributions have competing preferences for strongly localized and maximally dispersed structures. We investigate the energy landscape in dependence of the size of the 'charge', i.e. the weight of the Riesz interaction energy. In the two-dimensional case we first prove that for simply connected sets of small elastic energy, the elastic deficit controls the isoperimetric deficit. Building on this result, we show that for small charge the only minimizers of the full variational model are either balls or centered annuli. We complement these statements by a non-existence result for large charge. In three dimensions, we prove area and diameter bounds for configurations with small Willmore energy and show that balls are the unique minimizers of our variational model for sufficiently small charge.;math.AP
1801.01428;A Phase Transition in a Widom-Rowlinson Model with Curie-Weiss Interaction;An analog of the continuum Widom-Rowlinson model is introduced and studied. Its two-component version is a gas of point particles of types 0 and 1 placed in $\mathds{R}^d$, in which like particles do not interact and unlike particles contained in a vessel of volume $V$ repel each other with intensity $a/V$. The one-component version is a gas of particles with multi-particle interactions of Curie-Weiss type. Its thermodynamic behavior is obtained by integrating out the coordinates of one of the components of the two-component version. In the grand canonical setting, a rigorous theory of phase transitions in this model is developed and discussed. In particular, for both versions thermodynamic phases and phase diagrams are explicitly constructed and the equations of state are obtained and analyzed.;math-ph
1801.01429;Cohomological Hall algebras for Higgs torsion sheaves, moduli of triples and sheaves on surfaces;For any free oriented Borel-Moore homology theory $A$, we construct an associative product on the $A$-theory of the stack of Higgs torsion sheaves over a projective curve $C$. We show that the resulting algebra $A\mathbf{Ha}_C^0$ admits a natural shuffle presentation, and prove it is faithful when $A$ is replaced with usual Borel-Moore homology groups. We also introduce moduli spaces of stable triples, heavily inspired by Nakajima quiver varieties, whose $A$-theory admits an $A\mathbf{Ha}_C^0$-action. These triples can be interpreted as certain sheaves on $\mathbb P(T^*C)$. In particular, we obtain an action of $A\mathbf{Ha}_C^0$ on the cohomology of Hilbert schemes of points on $T^*C$.;math.RT
1801.01438;On the class of flat stable theories;A new notion of independence relation is given and associated to it, the class of flat theories, a subclass of strong stable theories including the superstable ones is introduced. More precisely, after introducing this independence relation, flat theories are defined as an appropriate version of superstability. It is shown that in a flat theory every type has finite weight and therefore flat theories are strong. Furthermore, it is shown that under reasonable conditions any type is non-orthogonal to a regular one. Concerning groups in flat theories, it is shown that type-definable groups behave like superstable ones, since they satisfy the same chain condition on definable subgroups and also admit a normal series of definable subgroup with semi-regular quotients.;math.LO
1801.01440;Arboreal Cantor actions;In this paper, we consider minimal equicontinuous actions of discrete countably generated groups on Cantor sets, obtained from the arboreal representations of absolute Galois groups of fields. In particular, we study the asymptotic discriminant of these actions. <br />The asymptotic discriminant is an invariant obtained by restricting the action to a sequence of nested clopen sets, and studying the isotropies of the enveloping group actions in such restricted systems. An enveloping (Ellis) group of such an action is a profinite group. <br />A large class of actions of profinite groups on Cantor sets is given by arboreal representations of absolute Galois groups of fields. We show how to associate to an arboreal representation an action of a discrete group, and give examples of arboreal representations with stable and wild asymptotic discriminant.;math.DS
1801.01448;A Beurling-Chen-Hadwin-Shen Theorem for Noncommutative Hardy Spaces Associated with Semifinite von Neumann Algebras with Unitarily Invariant Norms;We introduce a class of unitarily invariant, locally $\|\cdot\|_1$-dominating, mutually continuous norms with repect to $\tau$ on a von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{M}$ with a faithful, normal, semifinite tracial weight $\tau$. We prove a Beurling-Chen-Hadwin-Shen theorem for $H^\infty$-invariant spaces of $L^\alpha(\mathcal{M},\tau)$, where $\alpha$ is a unitarily invariant, locally $\|\cdot\|_1$-dominating, mutually continuous norm with respect to $\tau$, and $H^\infty$ is an extension of Arveson's noncommutative Hardy space. We use our main result to characterize the $H^\infty$-invariant subspaces of a noncommutative Banach function space $\mathcal I(\tau)$ with the norm $\|\cdot\|_{E }$ on $\mathcal{M}$, the crossed product of a semifinite von Neumann algebra by an action $\beta$, and $B(\mathcal{H})$ for a separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$.;math.OA
1801.01457;Biharmonic functions on spheres and hyperbolic spaces;We construct new explicit proper r-harmonic functions on the standard n-dimensional sphere S^n and hyperbolic space H^n for any r\ge 1 and n\ge 2.;math.DG
1801.01460;Hyperbolicity and bifurcations in holomorphic families of polynomial skew products;We initiate a parametric study of holomorphic families of polynomial skew products, i.e., polynomial endomorphisms of $\mathbb{C}^2$ of the form $F(z,w)= (p(z), q(z,w))$ that extend to holomorphic endomorphisms of $\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{C})$. We prove that dynamical stability in the sense of <a href="/abs/1403.7603">arXiv:1403.7603</a> preserves hyperbolicity within such families, and give a complete classification of the hyperbolic components that are the analogue, in this setting, of the complement of the Mandelbrot set for the family $z^2 +c$. We also precisely describe the geometry of the bifurcation locus and current near the boundary of the parameter space. One of our tools is an asymptotic equidistribution property for the bifurcation current. This is established in the general setting of families of endomorphisms of $\mathbb{P}^k$ and is the first equidistribution result of this kind for holomorphic dynamical systems in dimension larger than one.;math.DS
1801.01461;A New HDG Method for Dirichlet Boundary Control of Convection Diffusion PDEs I: High Regularity;We propose a new hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method to approximate the solution of a Dirichlet boundary control problem governed by an elliptic convection diffusion PDE. Even without a convection term, Dirichlet boundary control problems are well-known to be very challenging theoretically and numerically. Although there are many works in the literature on Dirichlet boundary control problems for the Poisson equation, the authors are not aware of any existing theoretical or numerical analysis works for convection diffusion Dirichlet control problems. We make two contributions. First, we obtain well-posedness and regularity results for the Dirichlet control problem. Second, under certain assumptions on the domain and the target state, we obtain optimal a priori error estimates in 2D for the control for the new HDG method. As far as the authors are aware, there are no existing comparable results in the literature. We present numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the HDG method.;math.NA
1801.01463;L&#x27,espace ad&#xe9,lique d&#x27,un tore sur un corps de fonctions;Let $k$ be a field of characteristic 0 and let $K$ be the function field of a smooth projective geometrically integral $k$-curve $X$. Let $T$ be a $K$-torus. In this article, we aim at studying the space of adelic points $T(S,\mathbb{A}_K)$ of $T$ outside a finite set $S$ of closed points of $X$. We start by proving that the group $T(K)$ of rational points of $T$ is always discrete (hence closed) in $T(S,\mathbb{A}_K)$. We then describe the quotient $T(\emptyset,\mathbb{A}_K)/T(K)$ in each of the following three cases: $k$ is an algebraically closed field, $k$ is the field of Laurent series $\mathbb{C}((t))$, and $k$ is a $p$-adic field. <br />Soient $k$ un corps de caract\'eristique 0 et $K$ le corps des fonctions d'une $k$-courbe projective lisse g\'eom\'etriquement int\`egre $X$. Soit $T$ un $K$-tore. Dans cet article, on cherche \`a \'etudier l'espace des points ad\'eliques $T(S,\mathbb{A}_K)$ de $T$ hors d'un ensemble fini $S$ de points ferm\'es de $X$. On commence par montrer que le groupe $T(K)$ des points rationnels de $T$ est toujours ferm\'e discret dans $T(S,\mathbb{A}_K)$. On d\'ecrit ensuite le quotient $T(\emptyset,\mathbb{A}_K)/T(K)$ dans chacun des trois cas suivants: $k$ corps alg\'ebriquement clos, $k=\mathbb{C}((t))$ et $k$ corps $p$-adique.;math.AG
1801.01482;Finite semilattices with many congruences;For an integer $n\geq 2$, let NCSL$(n)$ denote the set of sizes of congruence lattices of $n$-element semilattices. We find the four largest numbers belonging to NCSL$(n)$, provided that $n$ is large enough to ensure that $|$NCSL$(n)|\geq 4$. Furthermore, we describe the $n$-element semilattices witnessing these numbers.;math.RA
1801.01485;Variational analysis and variational rationality in behavioral sciences: stationary traps;This paper concerns applications of variational analysis to some local aspects of behavioral science modeling by developing an effective variational rationality approach to these and related issues. Our main attention is paid to local stationary traps, which reflect such local equilibrium and the like positions in behavioral science models that are not worthwhile to quit. We establish constructive linear optimistic evaluations of local stationary traps by using generalized differential tools of variational analysis that involve subgradients and normals for nonsmooth and nonconvex objects as well as variational and extremal principles.;math.OC
1801.01491;The Action of Young Subgroups on the Partition Complex;We study the restrictions, the strict fixed points, and the strict quotients of the partition complex $|\Pi_n|$, which is the $\Sigma_n$-space attached to the poset of proper nontrivial partitions of the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. <br />We express the space of fixed points $|\Pi_n|^G$ in terms of subgroup posets for general $G\subset \Sigma_n$ and prove a formula for the restriction of $|\Pi_n|$ to Young subgroups $\Sigma_{n_1}\times \dots\times \Sigma_{n_k}$. Both results follow by applying a general method, proven with discrete Morse theory, for producing equivariant branching rules on lattices with group actions. We uncover surprising links between strict Young quotients of $|\Pi_n|$, commutative monoid spaces, and the cotangent fibre in derived algebraic geometry. These connections allow us to construct a cofibre sequence relating various strict quotients $|\Pi_n|^\diamond\wedge_{\Sigma_n} (S^\ell)^{\wedge n}$ and give a combinatorial proof of a splitting in derived algebraic geometry. Combining all our results, we decompose strict Young quotients of $|\Pi_n|$ in terms of "atoms" $|\Pi_d|^\diamond\wedge_{\Sigma_d} (S^\ell)^{\wedge d}$ for $\ell$ odd and compute their homology. We thereby also generalise Goerss' computation of the algebraic Andr\'e-Quillen homology of trivial square-zero extensions from $\mathbb{F}_2$ to $\mathbb{F}_p$ for $p$ an odd prime.;math.AT
1801.01512;Hats: all or nothing;N players are randomly fitted with a colored hat (q different colors). All players guess simultaneously the color of their own hat observing only the hat colors of the other N-1 players. The team wins if all players guess right. No communication of any sort is allowed, except for an initial strategy session before the game begins. In the first part of our investigation we have q different colors with equal probability. Up to 4 colors we construct optimal strategies for any number of players using Hamming Complete Sets. For 5 colors we find optimal strategies up to 5 players using Optimal Hamming Sets. In the second part we have two colors where the probabilities may differ. We construct optimal strategies and maximal probability of winning the game for any number of players.;math.CO
1801.01526;An algebraic perspective on integer sparse recovery;Compressed sensing is a relatively new mathematical paradigm that shows a small number of linear measurements are enough to efficiently reconstruct a large dimensional signal under the assumption the signal is sparse. Applications for this technology are ubiquitous, ranging from wireless communications to medical imaging, and there is now a solid foundation of mathematical theory and algorithms to robustly and efficiently reconstruct such signals. However, in many of these applications, the signals of interest do not only have a sparse representation, but have other structure such as lattice-valued coefficients. While there has been a small amount of work in this setting, it is still not very well understood how such extra information can be utilized during sampling and reconstruction. Here, we explore the problem of integer sparse reconstruction, lending insight into when this knowledge can be useful, and what types of sampling designs lead to robust reconstruction guarantees. We use a combination of combinatorial, probabilistic and number-theoretic methods to discuss existence and some constructions of such sensing matrices with concrete examples. We also prove sparse versions of Minkowski's Convex Body and Linear Forms theorems that exhibit some limitations of this framework.;math.NA
1801.01530;The Mutating Contact Process: Model Introduction and Qualitative Analysis of Phase Transitions in its Survival;We introduce and study the mutating contact process, a variant of the multitype contact process, where one type mutates at a constant rate to the other type. We prove that on $\mathbb{Z}$ a single mutant cannot survive while on $\mathbb{T}_{d}$ there are distinct weak survival and extinction of a single mutant phases, yet the limiting distribution concentrates on configurations with no mutants of the first type for any values of the parameters.;math.PR
1801.01537;Tauberian class estimates for vector-valued distributions;We study Tauberian properties of regularizing transforms of vector-valued tempered distributions, that is, transforms of the form $M^{\mathbf{f}}_{\varphi}(x,y)=(\mathbf{f}\ast\varphi_{y})(x)$, where the kernel $\varphi$ is a test function and $\varphi_{y}(\cdot)=y^{-n}\varphi(\cdot/y)$. We investigate conditions which ensure that a distribution that a priori takes values in locally convex space actually takes values in a narrower Banach space. Our goal is to characterize spaces of Banach space valued tempered distributions in terms of so-called class estimates for the transform $M^{\mathbf{f}}_{\varphi}(x,y)$. Our results generalize and improve earlier Tauberian theorems of Drozhzhinov and Zav'yalov [Sb. Math. 194 (2003), 1599-1646]. Special attention is paid to find the optimal class of kernels $\varphi$ for which these Tauberian results hold.;math.FA
1801.01540;Jacob&#x27,s Ladder: Prime numbers in 2d;Prime numbers are one of the most intriguing figures in mathematics. Despite centuries of research, many questions remain still unsolved. In recent years, computer simulations are playing a fundamental role in the study of an immense variety of problems. In this work, we present a simple representation of prime numbers in two dimensions that allows us to formulate a number of conjectures that may lead to important avenues in the field of research on prime numbers. In particular, although the zeroes in our representation grow in a somewhat erratic, hardly predictable way, the gaps between them present a remarkable and intriguing property: a clear exponential decay in the frequency of gaps vs gap size. The smaller the gaps, the more frequently they appear. Additionally, the sequence of zeroes, despite being non-consecutive numbers, contains a number of primes approximately equal to n/log(n) , being n the number of terms in the sequence.;math.HO
1801.01542;Congruences of Power Sums;The following congruence for power sums, $S_n(p)$, is well known and has many applications: $1^n+2^n +\dots +p^n \equiv\begin{cases} -1 \text{ mod } p, &amp, \text{ if } \ p-1 \ | \ n, 0 \text{ mod } p, &amp, \text{ if } \ p-1 \ \not| \ n, \end{cases}$ where $n\in{\mathbb N}$ and $p$ is prime. We extend this congruence, in particular, to the case when $p$ is any power of a prime. We also show that the sequence $(S_n(m) \text{ mod } k )_{m \geq 1}$ is periodic and determine its period.;math.NT
1801.01544;Boundary value problem with measures for fractional elliptic equations involving source nonlinearities;We are concerned with positive solutions of equation (E) $(-\Delta)^s u=f(u)$ in a domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ ($N&gt,2s$), where $s \in (\frac{1}{2},1)$ and $f\in C^{\alpha}_{loc}(\mathbb{R})$ for some $\alpha \in(0,1)$. We establish a universal a priori estimate for positive solutions of (E), as well as for their gradients. Then for $C^2$ bounded domain $\Omega$, we prove the existence of positive solutions of (E) with prescribed boundary value $\rho \nu$, where $\rho&gt,0$ and $\nu$ is a positive Radon measure on $\partial \Omega$ with total mass $1$, and discuss regularity property of the solutions. When $f(u)=u^p$, we demonstrate that there exists a critical exponent $p_s:=\frac{N+s}{N-s}$ in the following sense. If $p\geq p_s$, the problem does not admit any positive solution with $\nu$ being a Dirac mass. If $p\in(1,p_s)$ there exits a threshold value $\rho^*&gt,0$ such that for $\rho\in (0, \rho^*]$, the problem admits a positive solution and for $\rho&gt,\rho^*$, no positive solution exists. We also show that, for $\rho&gt,0$ small enough, the problem admits at least two positive solutions.;math.AP
1801.01546;Characterization of distributions of $Q$-independent random variables on locally compact Abelian groups;Let $X$ be a second countable locally compact Abelian group. We prove some group analogues of the Skitovich--Darmois, Heyde and Kac--Bernstein characterisation theorems for $Q$-independent random variables taking values in the group $X$. The proofs of these theorems are reduced to solving some functional equations on the character group of the group $X$.;math.PR
1801.01552;Asymptotic bounds for spherical codes;The set of all error-correcting codes C over a fixed finite alphabet F of cardinality q determines the set of code points in the unit square with coordinates (R(C), delta (C)):= (relative transmission rate, relative minimal distance). The central problem of the theory of such codes consists in maximizing simultaneously the transmission rate of the code and the relative minimum Hamming distance between two different code words. The classical approach to this problem explored in vast literature consists in the inventing explicit constructions of "good codes" and comparing new classes of codes with earlier ones. Less classical approach studies the geometry of the whole set of code points (R,delta) (with q fixed), at first independently of its computability properties, and only afterwords turning to the problems of computability, analogies with statistical physics etc. The main purpose of this article consists in extending this latter strategy to domain of spherical codes.;cs.IT
1801.01555;Reeb Posets and Tree Approximations;A well known result in the analysis of finite metric spaces due to Gromov says that given any $(X,d_X)$ there exists a \emph{tree metric} $t_X$ on $X$ such that $\|d_X-t_X\|_\infty$ is bounded above by twice $\mathrm{hyp}(X)\cdot \log(2\,|X|)$. Here $\mathrm{hyp}(X)$ is the \emph{hyperbolicity} of $X$, a quantity that measures the \emph{treeness} of $4$-tuples of points in $X$. This bound is known to be asymptotically tight. <br />We improve this bound by restricting ourselves to metric spaces arising from filtered posets. By doing so we are able to replace the cardinality appearing in Gromov's bound by a certain poset theoretic invariant (the maximum length of fences in the poset) which can be much smaller thus significantly improving the approximation bound. <br />The setting of metric spaces arising from posets is rich: For example, save for the possible addition of new vertices, every finite metric graph can be induced from a filtered poset. Since every finite metric space can be isometrically embedded into a finite metric graph, our ideas are applicable to finite metric spaces as well. <br />At the core of our results lies the adaptation of the Reeb graph and Reeb tree constructions and the concept of hyperbolicity to the setting of posets, which we use to formulate and prove a tree approximation result for any filtered poset.;math.MG
1801.01556;A bound on the inducibility of cycles;In 1975, Pippenger and Golumbic conjectured that every n-vertex graph has at most $n^k/(k^k - k)$ induced cycles of length k for k at least 5. We prove that every n-vertex graph has at most $2 n^k/k^k$ induced cycles of length k.;math.CO
1801.01561;Multiplicity freeness of unitary representations in sections of holomorphic Hilbert bundles;We prove several results asserting that the action of a Banach-Lie group on Hilbert spaces of holomorphic sections of a holomorphic Hilbert space bundle over a complex Banach manifold is multiplicity free. These results require the existence of compatible antiholomorphic bundle maps and certain multiplicity freeness assumptions for stabilizer groups. For the group action on the base, the notion of an $(S,\sigma)$-weakly visible action (generalizing T.Koboyashi's visible actions) provides an effective way to express the assumptions in an economical fashion. In particular, we derive a version for group actions on homogeneous bundles for larger groups. We illustrate these general results by several examples related to operator groups and von Neumann algebras.;math.RT
1801.01562;The Distortion of the Reeb Quotient Map on Riemannian Manifolds;Given a metric space $X$ and a function $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$, the Reeb construction gives metric a space $X_f$ together with a quotient map $X \to X_f$. Under suitable conditions $X_f$ becomes a metric graph and can therefore be used as a graph approximation to $X$. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance from $X_f$ to $X$ is bounded by the half of the metric distortion of the quotient map. In this paper we consider the case where $X$ is a compact Riemannian manifold and $f$ is an excellent Morse function. In this case we provide bounds on the distortion of the quotient map which involve the first Betti number of the original space and a novel invariant which we call thickness.;math.MG
1801.01564;Expansion of Iterated Stratonovich Stochastic Integrals of Multiplicity 3, Based on Generalized Multiple Fourier Series, Converging in the Mean: General Case of Series Summation;The article is devoted to the development of the method of expansion and mean-square approximation of iterated Ito stochastic integrals, based on generalized multiple Fourier series, converging in the mean. We adapt this method for iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of multiplicity 3 from the Taylor-Stratonovich expansion. The main result of the article has been derived with using the triple Fourier-Legendre series as well as the triple trigonometric Fourier series for the general case of series summation. The results of the article can be applied to numerical integration of Ito stochastic differential equations in accordance with the strong criterion of convergence.;math.PR
1801.01566;Adaptive Finite Element Solution of the Porous Medium Equation in Pressure Formulation;A lack of regularity in the solution of the porous medium equation poses a serious challenge in its theoretical and numerical studies. A common strategy in theoretical studies is to utilize the pressure formulation of the equation where a new variable called the mathematical pressure is introduced. It is known that the new variable has much better regularity than the original one and Darcy's law for the movement of the free boundary can be expressed naturally in this new variable. The pressure formulation has not been used in numerical studies. The goal of this work is to study its use in the adaptive finite element solution of the porous medium equation. The MMPDE moving mesh strategy is employed for adaptive mesh movement while linear finite elements are used for spatial discretization. The free boundary is traced explicitly by integrating Darcy's law with the Euler scheme. Numerical results are presented for three two-dimensional examples. The method is shown to be second-order in space and first-order in time in the pressure variable. Moreover, the convergence order of the error in the location of the free boundary is almost second-order in the maximum norm. However, numerical results also show that the convergence order of the method in the original variable stays between first-order and second-order in the $L^1$ norm or between 0.5th-order and first-order in the $L^2$ norm. Nevertheless, the current method can offer some advantages over numerical methods based on the original formulation for situations with large exponents or when a more accurate location of the free boundary is desired.;math.NA
1801.01570;How Many Rounds Should You Expect in Urn Solitaire?;A certain sampling process, concerning an urn with balls of two colors, proposed in 1965 by B.E. Oakley and R.L. Perry, and discussed by Peter Winkler and Martin Gardner, that has an extremely simple answer for the probability, namely the constant function 1/2, has a far more complicated expected duration, that we discover and sketch the proof of. So unlike, for example, the classical gambler's ruin problem, for which both `probability of winning' and `expected duration' have very simple expressions, in this case the expected number of rounds is extremely complicated, and beyond the scope of humans.;math.CO
1801.01574;Testing Optimality of Sequential Decision-Making;This paper provides a statistical method to test whether a system that performs a binary sequential hypothesis test is optimal in the sense of minimizing the average decision times while taking decisions with given reliabilities. The proposed method requires samples of the decision times, the decision outcomes, and the true hypotheses, but does not require knowledge on the statistics of the observations or the properties of the decision-making system. The method is based on fluctuation relations for decision time distributions which are proved for sequential probability ratio tests. These relations follow from the martingale property of probability ratios and hold under fairly general conditions. We illustrate these tests with numerical experiments and discuss potential applications.;cs.IT
1801.01575;Punctured spheres in complex hyperbolic surfaces and bielliptic ball quotient compactifications;In this paper, we study punctured spheres in two dimensional ball quotient compactifications $(X, D)$. For example, we show that smooth toroidal compactifications of ball quotients cannot contain properly holomorphically embedded $3$-punctured spheres. We also use totally geodesic punctured spheres to prove ampleness of $K_X + \alpha D$ for $\alpha \in (\frac{1}{4}, 1)$, giving a sharp version of a theorem of the first author with G. Di Cerbo. Finally, we produce the first examples of bielliptic ball quotient compactifications modeled on the Gaussian integers.;math.GT
1801.01578;A Robust Preconditioner for High-Contrast Problems;A finite-element discretization of such an equation yields a linear system whose conditioning worsens as the variations in the values of PDE coefficients becomes large. This paper introduces a procedure by which the discrete system obtained from a linear finite element discretization of the given continuum problem is converted into an equivalent linear system of the saddle point type. Then a robust preconditioner for the Lanczos method of minimized iterations for solving the derived saddle point problem is proposed. Robustness with respect to the contrast parameter and the mesh size is justified. Numerical examples support theoretical results and demonstrate independence of the number of iterations on the contrast, the mesh size and also on the different contrasts on the inclusions.;math.NA
1801.01581;Frobenius-Perron Theory of Modified ADE Bound Quiver Algebras;The Frobenius-Perron dimension for an abelian category was recently introduced. We apply this theory to the category of representations of the finite-dimensional radical squared zero algebras associated to certain modified ADE graphs. In particular, we take an ADE quiver with arrows in a certain orientation and an arbitrary number of loops at each vertex. We show that the Frobenius-Perron dimension of this category is equal to the maximum number of loops at a vertex. Along the way, we introduce a result which can be applied in general to calculate the Frobenius-Perron dimension of a radical square zero bound quiver algebra. We use this result to introduce a family of abelian categories which produce arbitrarily large irrational Frobenius-Perron dimensions.;math.RA
1801.01584;Fixation probabilities and hitting times under low levels of frequency-dependent selection;In population genetics, diffusions on the unit interval are often used to model the frequency path of an allele. In this setting we derive approximations for fixation probabilities, expected hitting times and the expected site-frequency-spectrum under small frequency-dependent selection. Specifically, we rederive and extend the one-third rule of evolutionary game theory (Nowak et al., 2004) and effects of stochastic slowdown (Altrock and Traulsen, 2009). Since similar effects are of interest in other application areas, we formulate our results for general one-dimensional diffusions.;math.PR
1801.01588;On a class of polynomials connected to Bell polynomials;In this paper, we study a class of sequences of polynomials linked to the sequence of Bell polynomials. Some sequences of this class have applications on the theory of hyperbolic differential equations and other sequences generalize Laguerre polynomials and associated Lah polynomials. We discuss, for these polynomials, their explicit expressions, relations to the successive derivatives of a given function, real zeros and recurrence relations. Some known results are significantly simplified.;math.CO
1801.01593;Estimation in the spiked Wigner model: A short proof of the replica formula;We consider the problem of estimating a rank-one perturbation of a Wigner matrix in a setting of low signal-to-noise ratio. This serves as a simple model for principal component analysis in high dimensions. The mutual information per variable between the spike and the observed matrix, or equivalently, the normalized Kullback-Leibler divergence between the planted and null models are known to converge to the so-called {\em replica-symmetric} formula, the properties of which determine the fundamental limits of estimation in this model. We provide in this note a short and transparent proof of this formula, based on simple executions of Gaussian interpolations and standard concentration-of-measure arguments. The \emph{Franz-Parisi potential}, that is, the free entropy at a fixed overlap, plays an important role in our proof. Furthermore, our proof can be generalized straightforwardly to spiked tensor models of even order.;cs.IT
1801.01605;Distance between arithmetic progressions and perfect squares;In this paper, we study how close the terms of a finite arithmetic progression can get to a perfect square.

1801.01608;The Definition and Numerical Method of Final Value Problem and Arbitrary Value Problem;Many Engineering Problems could be mathematically described by Final Value Problem, which is the inverse problem of Initial Value Problem. Accordingly, the paper studies the final value problem in the field of ODE problems and analyses the differences and relations between initial and final value problems. The more general new concept of the endpoints-value problem which could describe both initial and final problems is proposed. Further, we extend the concept into inner-interval value problem and arbitrary value problem and point out that both endpoints-value problem and inner-interval value problem are special forms of arbitrary value problem. Particularly, the existence and uniqueness of the solutions of final value problem and inner-interval value problem of first order ordinary differential equation are proved for discrete problems. The numerical calculation formulas of the problems are derived, and for each algorithm, we propose the convergence and stability conditions of them. Furthermore, multivariate and high-order final value problems are further studied, and the condition of fixed delay is also discussed in this paper. At last, the effectiveness of the considered methods is validated by numerical experiment.;math.NA
1801.01610;On Convergence to Essential Singularities;An iterative optimization method applied to a function $f$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ will produce a sequence of arguments $\{\mathbf{x}_k\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, this sequence is often constrained such that $\{f(\mathbf{x}_k)\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ is monotonic. As part of the analysis of an iterative method, one may ask under what conditions the sequence $\{\mathbf{x}_k\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges. In 2005, Absil et al.\ employed the {\L}ojasiewicz gradient inequality in a proof of convergence, this requires that the objective function exist at a cluster point of the sequence. Here we provide a convergence result that does not require $f$ to be defined at the limit $\lim_{k \to \infty} \mathbf{x}_k$, should the limit exist. We show that a variant of the {\L}ojasiewicz gradient inequality holds on sets adjacent to singularities of bounded multivariate rational functions. We extend the results of Absil et al.\ to prove that if $\{\mathbf{x}_k\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ has a cluster point $\mathbf{x}_*$, if $f$ is a bounded multivariate rational function on $\mathbb{R}^n$, and if a technical condition holds, then $\mathbf{x}_k \to \mathbf{x}_*$ even if $\mathbf{x}_*$ is not in the domain of $f$. We demonstrate how this may be employed to analyze divergent sequences by mapping them to projective space, and consider the implications this has for the study of low-rank tensor approximations.;math.NA
1801.01613;High Throughput Low Delay Wireless Multicast via Multi-Channel Moving Window Codes;A fundamental challenge in wireless multicast has been how to simultaneously achieve high-throughput and low-delay for reliably serving a large number of users. In this paper, we show how to harness substantial throughput and delay gains by exploiting multi-channel resources. We develop a new scheme called Multi-Channel Moving Window Codes (MC-MWC) for multi-channel multi-session wireless multicast. The salient features of MC-MWC are three-fold. (i) High throughput: we show that MC-MWC achieves order-optimal throughput in the many-user many-channel asymptotic regime. Moreover, the number of channels required by a conventional channel-allocation based scheme is shown to be doubly-exponentially larger than that required by MC-MWC. (ii) Low delay: using large deviations theory, we show that the delay of MC-MWC decreases linearly with the number of channels, while the delay reduction of conventional schemes is no more than a finite constant. (iii) Low feedback overhead: the feedback overhead of MC-MWC is a constant that is independent of both the number of receivers in each session and the number of sessions in the network. Finally, our trace-driven simulation and numerical results validate the analytical results and show that the implementation complexity of MC-MWC is low.;cs.IT
1801.01619;Anticyclotomic $p$-adic $L$-functions for elliptic curves at some additive reduction primes;Let $E$ be a rational elliptic curve and let $p$ be an odd prime of additive reduction. Let $K$ be an imaginary quadratic field and fix a positive integer $c$ prime to the conductor of $E$. The main goal of the present article is to define an anticyclotomic $p$-adic $L$-function $\L$ attached to $E/K$ when $E/\QQ_p$ attains semistable reduction over an abelian extension. We prove that $\L$ satisfies the expected interpolation properties, namely, we show that if $\chi$ is an anticyclotomic character of conductor $cp^n$ then $\chi(\L)$ is equal (up to explicit constants) to $L(E,\chi,1)$ or $L'(E,\chi,1)$.;math.NT
1801.01625;Optimal Pilot Symbols Ratio in terms of Spectrum and Energy Efficiency in Uplink CoMP Networks;In wireless networks, Spectrum Efficiency (SE) and Energy Efficiency (EE) can be affected by the channel estimation that needs to be well designed in practice. In this paper, considering channel estimation error and non-ideal backhaul links, we optimize the pilot symbols ratio in terms of SE and EE in uplink Coordinated Multi-point (CoMP) networks. Modeling the channel estimation error, we formulate the SE and EE maximization problems by analyzing the system capacity with imperfect channel estimation. The maximal system capacity in SE optimization and the minimal transmit power in EE optimization, which both have the closed-form expressions, are derived by some reasonable approximations to reduce the complexity of solving complicated equations. Simulations are carried out to validate the superiority of our scheme, verify the accuracy of our approximation, and show the effect of pilot symbols ratio.;cs.IT
1801.01626;Weighted estimates and Fujita exponent for a nonlocal equation;We investigate a nonlocal equation $\partial_tu=\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}J(x-y)(u(y,t)-u(x,t))dy+a(x,t)u^p$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $a$ is unbounded and $J$ belongs to a weighted space. Crucial weighted $L^p$ and interpolation estimates for the Green operator are established by a new method based on the sharp Young's inequality, the asymptotic behavior of a regular varying coefficients exponential series, and the properties of auxiliary functions $\varGamma=(1+|x|^2/\eta)^{b/2}$ that $-\varGamma/\eta\lesssim J\ast\varGamma-\varGamma\lesssim\varGamma/\eta$ and $\eta^{-b_+/2}\lesssim\varGamma/\left\langle x\right\rangle^b\lesssim \eta^{-b_-/2}$. Blow-up behaviors are investigated by employing test functions $\phi_R=\varGamma$ ($\eta=R$) instead of principal eigenfunctions. Global well-posedness in weighted $L^p$ spaces for the Cauchy problem is proved. When $a\sim\left\langle x\right\rangle^\sigma$ the Fujita exponent is shown to be $1+(\sigma+2)/n$. Our approach generalizes and unifies nonlocal diffusion equations and pseudoparabolic equations.;math.AP

In order to study homogeneous system of linear differential equations, I considered vector space over division $D$-algebra, solving of linear equations over division $D$-algebra and the theory of eigenvalues in non commutative division $D$-algebra.

1801.01629;Euler evolution of a concentrated vortex in planar bounded domains;In this paper, we consider the time evolution of an ideal fluid in a planar bounded domain. We prove that if the initial vorticity is supported in a sufficiently small region with diameter $\varepsilon$, then the time evolved vorticity is also supported in a small region with diameter $d$, $d\leq C\varepsilon^{\alpha}$ for any $\alpha&lt,\frac{1}{3}$, and the center of the vorticity tends to the point vortex, the motion of which is described by the Kirchhoff-Routh equation.;math.AP
1801.01642;Parity Considerations in Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon Type Overpartitions;In 2010, Andrews considers a variety of parity questions connected to classical partition identities of Euler, Rogers, Ramanujan and Gordon. As a large part in his paper, Andrews considered the partitions by restricting the parity of occurrences of even numbers or odd numbers in the Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon type. The Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon type partition was defined by Gordon in 1961 as a combinatorial generalization of the Rogers-Ramaujan identities with odd moduli. <br />In 1974, Andrews derived an identity which can be considered as the generating function counterpart of the Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon theorem, and since then it has been called the Andrews--Gordon identity. By revisting the Andrews--Gordon identity Andrews extended his results by considering some additional restrictions involving parities to obtain some Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon type theorems and Andrews--Gordon type identities. In the end of Andrews' paper, he posed $15$ open problems. Most of Andrews' $15$ open problems have been settled, but the $11$th that "extend the parity indices to overpartitions in a manner" has not. In 2013, Chen, Sang and Shi, derived the overpartition analogues of the Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon theorem and the Andrews-Gordon identity. In this paper, we post some parity restrictions on these overpartitions analogues to get some Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon type overpartition theorems.;math.CO
1801.01648;Energy-Efficient User Access Control and Resource Allocation in HCNs with Non-Ideal Circuitry;In this paper, we study the energy-efficient user access control (UAC) based on resource allocation (RA) in heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs) with the required downlink data rate under non-ideal power amplifiers (PAs) and circuit power. It is proved that the energy consumption minimization is achieved when the typical user accesses only one base station (BS), while the other BSs remain in idle mode on the transmission resource allocated to this user. For this purpose, we reformulate the original non-convex optimization problem into a series of convex optimization problems where, in each case, the transmit power and duration of the accessed BS are determined. Then, the BS with the minimal energy consumption is selected for transmission. Considering the approximate situation, it is showed that the optimal transmit duration of the accessed BS can be estimated in closed form. The benefits of our proposed UAC and RA schemes are validated using numerical simulations, which also characterize the effect that non-ideal PAs have on the total energy consumption of different transmission schemes.;cs.IT
1801.01652;Energy Efficiency Maximization for CoMP Joint Transmission with Non-Ideal Power Amplifiers;Coordinated multipoint (CoMP) joint transmission (JT) can save a great deal of energy especially for cell-edge users due to strengthened received signal, but at the cost of deploying and coordinating cooperative nodes, which degrades energy efficiency (EE), particularly when considerable amount of energy is consumed by nonideal hardware circuit. In this paper, we study energyefficient cooperation establishment, including cooperative nodes selection (CNS) and power allocation, to satisfy a required data rate in coherent JT-CoMP networks with non-ideal power amplifiers (PAs) and circuit power. The selection priority lemma is proved first, and then the formulated discrete combinatorial EE optimization is resolved by proposing node selection criterion and deriving closedform expressions of optimal transmission power. Therefore, an efficient algorithm is provided and its superiority is validated by Monte Carlo simulations, which also show the effects of non-ideal PA and the data rate demand on EE and optimal number of active nodes.;cs.IT

1801.01663;Energy Efficiency Analysis of Heterogeneous Cellular Networks With Extra Cell Range Expansion;The split control and user plane is key to the future heterogeneous cellular network (HCN), where the small cells are dedicated for the most data transmission while the macrocells are mainly responsible for the control signaling. Adapting to this technology, we propose a general and tractable framework of extra cell range expansion (CRE) by introducing an additional bias factor to enlarge the range of small cells flexibly for the extra offloaded macrousers in a two-tier HCN, where the macrocell and small cell users have different required data rates. Using stochastic geometry, we analyze the energy efficiency (EE) of the extra CRE with joint low power transmission and resource partitioning, where the coverages of EE and data rate are formulated theoretically. Numerical simulations verify that the proposed extra CRE can improve the EE performance of HCN, and also show that deploying more small cells can provide benefits for EE coverage, but the EE improvement becomes saturated if the small cell density exceeds a threshold. Instead of establishing the detail configuration, this paper can provide some valuable insights and guidelines to the practical design of future networks, especially for the traffic offloading in HCN.;cs.IT
1801.01673;On the average condition number of tensor rank decompositions;We compute the expected value of powers of the geometric condition number of random tensor rank decompositions. It is shown in particular that the expected value of the condition number of $n_1\times n_2 \times 2$ tensors with a random rank-$r$ decomposition, given by factor matrices with independent and identically distributed standard normal entries, is infinite. This entails that it is expected and probable that such a rank-$r$ decomposition is sensitive to perturbations of the tensor. Moreover, it provides concrete further evidence that tensor decomposition can be a challenging problem, also from the numerical point of view. On the other hand, we provide strong theoretical and empirical evidence that tensors of size $n_1~\times~n_2~\times~n_3$ with all $n_1,n_2,n_3 \ge 3$ have a finite average condition number. This suggests there exists a gap in the expected sensitivity of tensors between those of format $n_1\times n_2 \times 2$ and other order-3 tensors. For establishing these results, we show that a natural weighted distance from a tensor rank decomposition to the locus of ill-posed decompositions with an infinite geometric condition number is bounded from below by the inverse of this condition number. That is, we prove one inequality towards a so-called condition number theorem for the tensor rank decomposition.;math.NA

Our work involves three parts. In the first part, we construct Eisenstein series adelically and compute their constant terms by computing local integrals. In the second part, we prove a control theorem for one-variable ordinary $\Lambda$-adic Hilbert modular forms following Hida's work on the space of multivariable ordinary $\Lambda$-adic Hilbert cusp forms. In part three, we compute congruence modules related to Hilbert Eisenstein series through an analog of Ohta's methods.;math.NT

1801.01696;Empirical Bayes analysis of spike and slab posterior distributions;In the sparse normal means model, convergence of the Bayesian posterior distribution associated to spike and slab prior distributions is considered. The key sparsity hyperparameter is calibrated via marginal maximum likelihood empirical Bayes. The plug-in posterior squared-$L^2$ norm is shown to converge at the minimax rate for the euclidean norm for appropriate choices of spike and slab distributions. Possible choices include standard spike and slab with heavy tailed slab, and the spike and slab LASSO of Rockov\'a and George with heavy tailed slab. Surprisingly, the popular Laplace slab is shown to lead to a suboptimal rate for the full empirical Bayes posterior. This provides a striking example where convergence of aspects of the empirical Bayes posterior does not entail convergence of the full empirical Bayes posterior itself.;math.ST
1801.01699;Variable-Length Intrinsic Randomness Allowing Positive Value of the Average Variational Distance;This paper considers the problem of variable-length intrinsic randomness. We propose the average variational distance as the performance criterion from the viewpoint of a dual relationship with the problem formulation of variable-length resolvability. Previous study has derived the general formula of the $\epsilon$-variable-length resolvability. We derive the general formula of the $\epsilon$-variable-length intrinsic randomness. Namely, we characterize the supremum of the mean length under the constraint that the value of the average variational distance is smaller than or equal to a constant $\epsilon$. Our result clarifies a dual relationship between the general formula of $\epsilon$-variable-length resolvability and that of $\epsilon$-variable-length intrinsic randomness. We also derive a lower bound of the quantity characterizing our general formula.;cs.IT
1801.01709;Energy Efficiency Maximization of Full-Duplex Two-Way Relay With Non-Ideal Power Amplifiers and Non-Negligible Circuit Power;In this paper, we maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of full-duplex (FD) two-way relay (TWR) systems under non-ideal power amplifiers (PAs) and non-negligible transmission-dependent circuit power. We start with the case where only the relay operates full duplex and two timeslots are required for TWR. Then, we extend to the advanced case, where the relay and the two nodes all operate full duplex, and accomplish TWR in a single timeslot. In both cases, we establish the intrinsic connections between the optimal transmit powers and durations, based on which the original non-convex EE maximization can be convexified and optimally solved. Simulations show the superiority of FD-TWR in terms of EE, especially when traffic demand is high. The simulations also reveal that the maximum EE of FD-TWR is more sensitive to the PA efficiency, than it is to self-cancellation. The full FD design of FD-TWR is susceptible to traffic imbalance, while the design with only the relay operating in the FD mode exhibits strong tolerance.;cs.IT

The main results consist of global (in time) existence of weak solutions, characterization of parabolic smoothing effects (implying under proper condition eventual boundedness of trajectories), and convergence of each solution to a (single) equilibrium. In particular, to prove the convergence result, a variant of the so-called \L ojasiewicz-Simon inequality is provided for the fractional Dirichlet Laplacian and (possibly) non-analytic (but $C^1$) nonlinearities.;math.AP

1801.01730;Limit cycles of piecewise polynomial perturbations of higher dimensional linear differential systems;The averaging theory has been extensively employed for studying periodic solutions of smooth and nonsmooth differential systems. Here, we extend the averaging theory for studying periodic solutions a class of regularly perturbed non-autonomous $n$-dimensional discontinuous piecewise smooth differential system. As a fundamental hypothesis, it is assumed that the unperturbed system has a manifold $\mathcal{Z}\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ of periodic solutions satisfying $\dim(\mathcal{Z})&lt,n.$ Then, we apply this result to study limit cycles bifurcating from periodic solutions of linear differential systems, $x'=Mx$, when they are perturbed inside a class of discontinuous piecewise polynomial differential systems with two zones. More precisely, we study the periodic solutions of the following differential system $x'=Mx+ \varepsilon F_1^n(x)+\varepsilon^2F_2^n(x),$ in $\mathbb{R}^{d+2}$ where $\varepsilon$ is a small parameter, $M$ is a $(d+2)\times(d+2)$ matrix having one pair of pure imaginary conjugate eigenvalues, $m$ zeros eigenvalues, and $d-m$ non-zero real eigenvalues.;math.DS

When a tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ is graded over a group $\Gamma$, a torus-valued 3-cocycle on $\Gamma$ can be used to deform the associator of $\mathcal{C}$. Based on a natural Fell bundle structure of the tube algebra over the action groupoid of the adjoint action of $\Gamma$, we show that the tube algebra of the twisted category is a 2-cocycle twisting of the original one.;math.QA
1801.01738;Energy-efficient resource allocation for hybrid bursty services in multi-relay OFDM networks;In this paper, we propose Mapped Two-way Water Filling (MTWF) scheme to maximize Energy Efficiency (EE) for hybrid bursty services with Quality of Services (QoS) requirements in Two-Way Multi-Relay (TWMR) OFDM networks. The bursty traffic is first analyzed by strictly proved equivalent homogeneous Poisson process, based on which the QoS requirements are converted into sum-rate constraints. The formulated non-convex EE maximization problem, including subcarrier assignment, Relay Selection (RS) and rate allocation, is NP-hard involving combinatorial optimization. To conduct optimal RS on each subcarrier without priori bursty traffic knowledge, we utilize some approximate relationships under high data rate demands to remove its dependence on two-way data rates, and simplify the whole optimization problem as well. After the optimal channel configuration is obtained, which only depends on channel conditions, subcarrier assignment is attained through Elitist Selection Genetic Algorithm (ESGA), and rate allocation of each service is fulfilled by deducing two-way water filling principle. A new equivalent optimization objective function is proposed next as the simple evaluating index in ESGA to reduce complexity. Finally, simulations are carried out to verify the superiority and convergence of our scheme, as well as the applicability for different scenarios.;cs.IT
1801.01740;Analysis of a micro-macro acceleration method with minimum relative entropy moment matching;We analyse convergence of a micro-macro acceleration method for the Monte Carlo simulation of stochastic differential equations with time-scale separation between the (fast) evolution of individual trajectories and the (slow) evolution of the macroscopic function of interest. We consider a class of methods, presented in [Debrabant, K., Samaey, G., Zieli\'nski, P. A micro-macro acceleration method for the Monte Carlo simulation of stochastic differential equations. SINUM, 55 (2017) no. 6, 2745-2786], that performs short bursts of path simulations, combined with the extrapolation of a few macroscopic state variables forward in time. After extrapolation, a new microscopic state is then constructed, consistent with the extrapolated variable and minimising the perturbation caused by the extrapolation. In the present paper, we study a specific method in which this perturbation is minimised in a relative entropy sense. We discuss why relative entropy is a useful metric, both from a theoretical and practical point of view, and rigorously study local errors and numerical stability of the resulting method as a function of the extrapolation time step and the number of macroscopic state variables. Using these results, we discuss convergence to the full microscopic dynamics, in the limit when the extrapolation time step tends to zero and the number of macroscopic state variables tends to infinity.;math.NA
1801.01744;Volumes and Siegel-Veech constants of $\mathcal{H}(2g-2)$ and Hodge integrals;In the 80's H. Masur and W. Veech defined two numerical invariants of strata of abelian differentials: the volume and the Siegel-Veech constant. Based on numerical experiments, A. Eskin and A. Zorich proposed a series of conjectures for the large genus asymptotics of these invariants. By a careful analysis of the asymptotic behavior of quasi-modular forms, D. Chen, M. Moeller, and D. Zagier proved this conjecture for strata of differentials with simple zeros. Here, we prove that the conjecture holds for the other extreme case, i.e. for strata of differentials with a unique zero. Our main ingredient is the expression of the numerical invariants of these strata in terms of Hodge integrals on moduli spaces of curves.;math.AG
1801.01752;Improving the Secrecy of Distributed Storage Systems using Interference Alignment;Regenerating codes based on the approach of interference alignment for wireless interference channel achieve the cut-set bound for distributed storage systems. These codes provide data reliability, and perform efficient exact node repair when some node fails. Interference alignment as a concept is especially important to improve the repair efficiency of a failed node in a minimum storage regenerating (MSR) code. In addition it can improve the stored data security in presence of passive intruders. In this paper we construct a new code resilient against a threat model where a passive eavesdropper can access the data stored on a subset of nodes and the downloaded data during the repair process of a subset of failed nodes. We achieve an optimal secrecy capacity for the new explicit construction of MSR interference alignment code. Hence, we show that the eavesdropper obtains zero information from the original message stored across the distributed storage, and that we achieve a perfect secrecy.;cs.IT
1801.01754;Pseudo-Anosov maps with small stretch factors on punctured surfaces;Consider the problem of estimating the minimum entropy of pseudo-Anosov maps on a surface of genus $g$ with $n$ punctures. We determine the behaviour of this minimum number for a certain large subset of the $(g,n)$ plane, up to a multiplicative constant. In particular it has been shown that for fixed $n$, this minimum value behaves as $\frac{1}{g}$, proving what Penner speculated in 1991.;math.GT
1801.01761;Numerical Methods for Quasi-Periodic Incident Fields Scattered by Locally Perturbed Periodic Surfaces;Waves scattering from unbounded structures are always complicated problems for numerical simulations. For the case that the non-periodic incident field scattered by (locally perturbed) periodic surfaces, with the help of the Bloch transform, the problem could be solved by some finite element methods, if the incident fields decay at certain rate at the infinity. For faster decaying incident fields, a high order numerical method is also available. However, in these cases, the plain waves, which belong to a very important family of incident fields but do not decay at the infinity, are not included. In this paper, we aim to develop the Bloch transform based standard finite method for this certain case, and then establish the high order method afterwards. Numerical experiments have been carried out for both the standard and high order numerical methods. Based on the algorithms for incident plain waves, we could also extend the numerical methods to more generalized cases when only the not so efficient standard method is available.;math.NA
1801.01766;Right Circulant Matrices with Generalized Fibonacci and\ Lucas Polynomials and Coding Theory;In this paper, we give two new coding algorithms by means of right circulant matrices with elements generalized Fibonacci and Lucas polynomials. For this purpose, we study basic properties of right circulant matrices using generalized Fibonacci polynomials $F_{p,q,n}\left( x\right) $, generalized Lucas polynomials $L_{p,q,n}\left( x\right) $ and geometric sequences.;math.CO
1801.01770;Regularity Results of the Thin Obstacle Problem for the $p(x)$-Laplacian;We study thin obstacle problems involving the energy functional with $p(x)$-growth. We prove higher integrability and H\"{o}lder regularity for the gradient of minimizers of the thin obstacle problems under the assumption that the variable exponent $p(x)$ is H\"{o}lder continuous.;math.AP
1801.01774;Global solvability and boundedness in the $N$-dimensional quasilinear chemotaxis model with logistic source and consumption of chemoattractant;We consider the following chemotaxis model %fully parabolic Keller-Segel system with logistic source $$ \left\{\begin{array}{ll} u_t=\nabla\cdot(D(u)\nabla u)-\chi\nabla\cdot(u\nabla v)+\mu (u-u^2),\quad x\in \Omega, t&gt,0, \disp{v_t-\Delta v=-uv },\quad x\in \Omega, t&gt,0, %\disp{\tau w_t+\delta w=u },\quad %x\in \Omega, t&gt,0, \disp{(\nabla D(u)-\chi u\cdot \nabla v)\cdot \nu=\frac{\partial v}{\partial\nu}=0},\quad x\in \partial\Omega, t&gt,0, \disp{u(x,0)=u_0(x)},\quad v(x,0)=v_0(x),~~ x\in \Omega \end{array}\right. $$ on a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N(N\geq1)$, with smooth boundary $\partial\Omega, \chi$ and $\mu$ are positive constants. Besides appropriate smoothness assumptions, in this paper it is only required that $D(u)\geq C_{D}(u+1)^{m-1}$ for all $u\geq 0$ with some $C_{D} &gt, 0$ and some $$ m&gt,\left\{\begin{array}{ll} 1-\frac{\mu}{\chi[1+\lambda_{0}\|v_0\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}2^{3}]}~~\mbox{if}~~ N\leq2, % &gt,1+\frac{(N+2-2r)^+}{N+2}~~~~~~\mbox{if}~~ % \frac{N+2}{2}\geq r\geq\frac{N+2}{N}, 1~~~~~~\mbox{if}~~ N\geq3, \end{array}\right. $$ then for any sufficiently smooth initial data there exists a classical solution which is global in time and bounded, where $\lambda_{0}$ is a positive constant which is corresponding to the maximal sobolev regularity. The results of this paper extends the results of Jin (J. Diff. Eqns., 263(9)(2017), 5759-5772), who proved the possibility of boundness of weak solutions, in the case $m&gt,1$ and $N=3$.;math.AP

1801.01778;Remarks on the abelian convexity theorem;This note contains some observations on abelian convexity theorems. Convexity along an orbit is established in a very general setting using Kempf-Ness functions. This is applied to give short proofs of the Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg theorem and of abelian convexity for the gradient map in the case of a real analytic submanifold of complex projective space. Finally we give an application to the action on the probability measures.;math.DG
1801.01779;Logarithmic de Rham comparison for open rigid spaces;In this note, we prove the logarithmic $p$-adic comparison theorem for open rigid analytic varieties. We prove that a smooth rigid analytic variety with a strict simple normal crossing divisor is locally $K(\pi,1)$ (in a certain sense) with respect to $\mathbb{F}_p$-local systems and ramified coverings along the divisor. We follow Scholze's method to produce a pro-version of the Faltings site and use this site to prove a primitive comparison theorem in our setting. After introducing period sheaves in our setting, we prove aforesaid comparison theorem.;math.AG
1801.01780;Probabilistic max-plus schemes for solving Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations;We consider fully nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations associated to diffusion control problems involving a finite set-valued (or switching) control and possibly a continuum-valued control. In previous works (Akian, Fodjo, 2016 and 2017), we introduced a lower complexity probabilistic numerical algorithm for such equations by combining max-plus and numerical probabilistic approaches. The max-plus approach is in the spirit of the one of McEneaney, Kaise and Han (2011), and is based on the distributivity of monotone operators with respect to suprema. The numerical probabilistic approach is in the spirit of the one proposed by Fahim, Touzi and Warin (2011). A difficulty of the latter algorithm was in the critical constraints imposed on the Hamiltonian to ensure the monotonicity of the scheme, hence the convergence of the algorithm. Here, we present new probabilistic schemes which are monotone under rather weak assumptions, and show error estimates for these schemes. These estimates will be used in further works to study the probabilistic max-plus method.;math.OC
1801.01784;Vanishing Viscosity Limits of Scalar Equations with Degenerate Diffusivity;We consider a scalar, possibly degenerate parabolic equation with a source term, in several space dimensions. For initial data with bounded variation we prove the existence of solutions to the initial-value problem. Then we show that these solutions converge, in the vanishing-viscosity limit, to the Kruzhkov entropy solution of the corresponding hyperbolic equation. The proof exploits the H-measure compactness in several space dimensions.;math.AP
1801.01790;Multiple addition, deletion and restriction theorems for hyperplane arrangements;In the study of free arrangements, the most useful result to construct/check free arrangements is the addition-deletion theorem. Recently, the multiple version of the addition theorem is proved, called the multiple addition theorem (MAT) to prove the ideal-free theorem. The aim of this article is to give the deletion version of MAT, the multiple deletion theorem (MDT). Also, we can generalize MAT from the viewpoint of our new proof. Moreover, we introduce their restriction version, a multiple restriction theorem (MRT). Applications of them including the combinatorial freeness of the extended Catalan arrangements are given.;math.CO
1801.01795;Sparse highly connected spanning subgraphs in dense directed graphs;Mader proved that every strongly $k$-connected $n$-vertex digraph contains a strongly $k$-connected spanning subgraph with at most $2kn - 2k^2$ edges, where the equality holds for the complete bipartite digraph ${DK}_{k,n-k}$. For dense strongly $k$-connected digraphs, this upper bound can be significantly improved. More precisely, we prove that every strongly $k$-connected $n$-vertex digraph $D$ contains a strongly $k$-connected spanning subgraph with at most $kn + 800k(k+\overline{\Delta}(D))$ edges, where $\overline{\Delta}(D)$ denotes the maximum degree of the complement of the underlying undirected graph of a digraph $D$. Here, the additional term $800k(k+\overline{\Delta}(D))$ is tight up to multiplicative and additive constants. As a corollary, this implies that every strongly $k$-connected $n$-vertex semicomplete digraph contains a strongly $k$-connected spanning subgraph with at most $kn + 800k^2$ edges, which is essentially optimal since $800k^2$ cannot be reduced to the number less than $k(k-1)/2$. <br />We also prove an analogous result for strongly $k$-arc-connected directed multigraphs. Both proofs yield polynomial-time algorithms.;math.CO
1801.01796;Spatially Coupled Sparse Regression Codes: Design and State Evolution Analysis;We consider the design and analysis of spatially coupled sparse regression codes (SC-SPARCs), which were recently introduced by Barbier et al. for efficient communication over the additive white Gaussian noise channel. SC-SPARCs can be efficiently decoded using an Approximate Message Passing (AMP) decoder, whose performance in each iteration can be predicted via a set of equations called state evolution. In this paper, we give an asymptotic characterization of the state evolution equations for SC-SPARCs. For any given base matrix (that defines the coupling structure of the SC-SPARC) and rate, this characterization can be used to predict whether or not AMP decoding will succeed in the large system limit. We then consider a simple base matrix defined by two parameters $(\omega, \Lambda)$, and show that AMP decoding succeeds in the large system limit for all rates $R &lt, \mathcal{C}$. The asymptotic result also indicates how the parameters of the base matrix affect the decoding progression. Simulation results are presented to evaluate the performance of SC-SPARCs defined with the proposed base matrix.;cs.IT
1801.01797;Monte Carlo integration with a growing number of control variates;It is well known that Monte Carlo integration with variance reduction by means of control variates can be implemented by the ordinary least squares estimator for the intercept in a multiple linear regression model. A central limit theorem is established for the integration error if the number of control variates tends to infinity. The integration error is scaled by the standard deviation of the error term in the regression model. If the linear span of the control variates is dense in a function space that contains the integrand, the integration error tends to zero at a rate which is faster than the square root of the number of Monte Carlo replicates. Depending on the situation, increasing the number of control variates may or may not be computationally more efficient than increasing the Monte Carlo sample size.;math.ST
1801.01798;On the existence of an ultra central approximate identity for certain semigroup algebras;In this paper we characterize the existance of an ultra central approximate identity for $\ell^{1}(S)$, where $S$ is a uniformly locally finite inverse semigroup. As an application, for the Brandt semigroup $S=M^{0}(G,I)$ over a non-empty set $I$, we show that $\ell^{1}(S)$ has an ultra central approximate identity if and only if $I$ is finite.;math.FA
1801.01801;On a connectedness principle of Shokurov-Koll&#xe1,r type;Let $(X,\Delta)$ be a log pair over $S$, such that $-(K_X+\Delta)$ is nef over $S$. It is conjectured that the intersection of the non-klt (non Kawamata log terminal) locus of $(X,\Delta)$ with any fiber $X_s$ has at most two connected components. We prove this conjecture in dimension $\leq 4$ and in arbitrary dimension assuming the termination of klt flips.;math.AG
1801.01802;Neighborhood-Prime Labelings of Trees and Other Classes of Graphs;A neighborhood-prime labeling of a graph is a variation of a prime labeling in which the vertices are assigned labels from $1$ to $|V(G)|$ such that the $\gcd$ of the labels in the neighborhood of each non-degree $1$ vertex is equal to $1$. In this paper, we examine neighborhood-prime labelings of several classes of graphs such as polygonal snakes and books, with a focus on trees including caterpillars, spiders, and firecrackers.;math.CO
1801.01806;An elliptic boundary value problem for $G_{2}$ structures;We show that the $G_{2}$ holonomy equation on a manifold with boundary, with prescribed 3-form on the boundary, is elliptic. The main point is to set up a suitable linear elliptic boundary value problem. This result leads to a deformation theory. In particular we establish the existence of certain $G_{2}$ cobordisms between two small deformations of a Calabi-Yau 3-fold.;math.DG
1801.01808;On behavior of homeomorphisms with inverse modulus conditions;We consider some class of homeomorphisms of domains of Euclidean space, which are more general than quasiconformal mappings. For these homeomorphisms, we have obtained theorems on local behavior of it's inverse mappings in a given domain. Under some additional conditions, we proved results about behavior of mappings mentioned above in the closure of the domain.;math.MG
1801.01812;Horospheres in Teichm&#xfc,ller space and mapping class group;We study the geometry of horospheres in Teichm\"uller space of Riemann surfaces of genus g with n punctures, where $3g-3+n\geq 2$. We show that every $C^1$-diffeomorphism of Teichm\"uller space to itself that preserves horospheres is an element of the extended mapping class group. Using the relation between horospheres and metric balls, we obtain a new proof of Royden's Theorem that the isometry group of the Teichm\"uller metric is the extended mapping class group.;math.GT
1801.01813;On a numerical upper bound for the extended Goldbach conjecture;The Goldbach conjecture states that every even number can be decomposed as the sum of two primes. Let $D(N)$ denote the number of such prime decompositions for an even $N$. It is known that $D(N)$ can be bounded above by $$ D(N) \leq C^* \Theta(N), \quad \Theta(N):= \frac{N}{\log^2 N}\prod_{\substack{p|N p&gt,2}} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{p-2}\right)\prod_{p&gt,2}\left(1-\frac{1}{(p-1)^2}\right) $$ where $C^*$ denotes Chen's constant. It is conjectured that $C^*=2$. In 2004, Wu showed that $C^* \leq 7.8209$. We attempted to replicate his work in computing Chen's constant, and in doing so we provide an improved approximation of the Buchstab function $\omega(u)$, \begin{align*} \omega(u)=1/u, &amp, \quad (1\leq u\leq 2), (u \omega(u))'=\omega(u-1), &amp, \quad (u\geq 2). \end{align*} based on work done by Cheer and Goldston. For each interval $[j,j+1]$, they expressed $\omega(u)$ as a Taylor expansion about $u=j+1$. We expanded about the point $u=j+0.5$, so $\omega(u)$ was never evaluated more than $0.5$ away from the center of the Taylor expansion, which gave much stronger error bounds. <br />Issues arose while using this Taylor expansion to compute the required integrals for Chen's constant, so we proceeded with solving the above differential equation to obtain $\omega(u)$, and then integrating the result. Although the values that were obtained undershot Wu's results, we pressed on and refined Wu's work by discretising his integrals with finer granularity. The improvements to Chen's constant were negligible (as predicted by Wu). This provides experimental evidence, but not a proof, that were Wu's integrals computed on smaller intervals in exact form, the improvement to Chen's constant would be negligible. Thus, any substantial improvement on Chen's constant likely requires a radically different method to what Wu provided.;math.HO
1801.01816;Finding the seed of uniform attachment trees;A uniform attachment tree is a random tree that is generated dynamically. Starting from a fixed "seed" tree, vertices are added sequentially by attaching each vertex to an existing vertex chosen uniformly at random. Upon observing a large (unlabeled) tree, one wishes to find the initial seed. We investigate to what extent seed trees can be recovered, at least partially. We consider three types of seeds: a path, a star, and a random uniform attachment tree. We propose and analyze seed-finding algorithms for all three types of seed trees.;math.PR
1801.01819;Twisted arithmetic Siegel Weil formula on X0(N);In this paper, we study twisted arithmetic divisors on the modular curve X_0(N) with N square-free. For each pair (\Delta, r) where \Delta &gt,0 and \Delta \equiv r^2 \mod 4N, we constructed a twisted arithmetic theta function \phi_{\Delta, r}(\tau) which is a generating function of arithmetic twisted Heegner divisors. We prove the modularity of \phi_{\Delta, r}(\tau), along the way, we also identify the arithmetic pairing \langle \phi_{\Delta, r}(\tau),\widehat{\omega}_N \rangle with special value of some Eisenstein series, where \widehat{\omega}_N is a normalized metric Hodge line bundle.;math.NT
1801.01820;Design and Implementation of a Polar Codes Blind Detection Scheme;In blind detection, a set of candidates has to be decoded within a strict time constraint, to identify which transmissions are directed at the user equipment. Blind detection is required by the 3GPP LTE/LTE-Advanced standard, and it will be required in the 5th generation wireless communication standard (5G) as well. Polar codes have been selected for use in 5G: thus, the issue of blind detection of polar codes must be addressed. We propose a polar code blind detection scheme where the user ID is transmitted instead of some of the frozen bits. A first, coarse decoding phase helps selecting a subset of candidates that is decoded by a more powerful algorithm: an early stopping criterion is also introduced for the second decoding phase. Simulations results show good missed detection and false alarm rates, along with substantial latency gains thanks to early stopping. We then propose an architecture to implement the devised blind detection scheme, based on a tunable decoder that can be used for both phases. The architecture is synthesized and implementation results are reported for various system parameters. The reported area occupation and latency, obtained in 65 nm CMOS technology, are able to meet 5G requirements, and are guaranteed to meet them with even less resource usage in the latest technology nodes.;cs.IT
1801.01826;Compactifiable classes of compacta;We introduce the notion of compactifiable classes -- these are classes of metrizable compact spaces that can be up to homeomorphic copies ``disjointly combined'' into one metrizable compact space. This is witnessed by so-called compact composition of the class. Analogously, we consider Polishable classes and Polish compositions. The question of compactifiability or Polishability of a class is related to hyperspaces. Strongly compactifiable and strongly Polishable classes may be characterized by the existence of a corresponding family in the hyperspace of all metrizable compacta. We systematically study the introduced notions -- we give several characterizations, consider preservation under various constructions, and raise several questions.;math.GN
1801.01830;Multipliers in Bessel potential spaces. The case of different sign smooth indices;The objective of this paper is to describe the space of multipliers acting from a Bessel potential space $H^s_p(\mathbb R^n)$ into another space $H^{-t}_q(\mathbb R^n)$, provided that the smooth indices of these spaces have different signs, i.e. $s, t \geqslant 0$. This space of multipliers consists of distributions $u$, such that for all $\varphi \in H^s_p(\mathbb R^n)$ the product $\varphi \cdot u$ is well-defined and belongs to the space $H^{-t}_q(\mathbb R^n)$. We succeed to describe this space explicitly, provided that $p \leqslant q$ and one of the following conditions $$ s \geqslant t \geqslant 0, \ s &gt, n/p \ \ \, \text{or} \ \ \, t \geqslant s \geqslant 0, \ t &gt, n/q' \quad (\: \text{where} \, 1/q +1/q' = 1), $$ holds. In this case one has $$ M[H^s_p(\mathbb{R}^n) \to H^{-t}_{q}(\mathbb{R}^n)] = H^{-t}_{q, \: unif}(\mathbb{R}^n) \cap H^{-s}_{p', \: unif}(\mathbb{R}^n), $$ where $H^\gamma_{r, \: unif}(\mathbb{R}^n), \: \gamma \in \mathbb{R}, \: r &gt, 1$ is the scale of uniformly localized Bessel potential spaces. <br />In particular but important case $s = t &lt, n/\max (p,q')$ we prove two-sided continuous embeddings $$ H^{-s}_{r_1, \: unif}(\mathbb{R}^n) \subset M[H^s_p(\mathbb{R}^n) \to H^{-s}_q(\mathbb{R}^n)] \subset H^{-s}_{r_2, \: unif}(\mathbb{R}^n), $$ where $r_2 = \max (p', q), \ r_1 =[s/n-(1/p -1/q)]^{-1}$.;math.FA
1801.01833;Seymour&#x27,s conjecture on 2-connected graphs of large pathwidth;We prove the conjecture of Seymour (1993) that for every apex-forest $H_1$ and outerplanar graph $H_2$ there is an integer $p$ such that every 2-connected graph of pathwidth at least $p$ contains $H_1$ or $H_2$ as a minor. An independent proof was recently obtained by Dang and Thomas.;math.CO
1801.01838;A Bramble-Pasciak conjugate gradient method for discrete Stokes equations with random viscosity;We study the iterative solution of linear systems of equations arising from stochastic Galerkin finite element discretizations of saddle point problems. We focus on the Stokes model with random data parametrized by uniformly distributed random variables and discuss well-posedness of the variational formulations. We introduce a Bramble-Pasciak conjugate gradient method as a linear solver. It builds on a non-standard inner product associated with a block triangular preconditioner. The block triangular structure enables more sophisticated preconditioners than the block diagonal structure usually applied in MINRES methods. We show how the existence requirements of a conjugate gradient method can be met in our setting. We analyze the performance of the solvers depending on relevant physical and numerical parameters by means of eigenvalue estimates. For this purpose, we derive bounds for the eigenvalues of the relevant preconditioned sub-matrices. We illustrate our findings using the flow in a driven cavity as a numerical test case, where the viscosity is given by a truncated Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion of a random field. In this example, a Bramble-Pasciak conjugate gradient method with block triangular preconditioner outperforms a MINRES method with block diagonal preconditioner in terms of iteration numbers.;math.NA
1801.01839;Characterization of rational matrices that admit finite digit representations;Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ matrix with rational entries and let \[ \mathbb{Z}^n[A] := \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( \mathbb{Z}^n + A\mathbb{Z}^n + \dots + A^{k-1}\mathbb{Z}^n\right) \] be the minimal $A$-invariant $\mathbb{Z}$-module containing the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$. If $\mathcal{D}\subset\mathbb{Z}^n[A]$ is a finite set we call the pair $(A,\mathcal{D})$ a digit system. We say that $(A,\mathcal{D})$ has the finiteness property if each $\mathbf{z} \in \mathbb{Z}^n[A]$ can be written in the form \[ \mathbf{z} = \mathbf{d}_0 + A\mathbf{d}_1 + \dots + A^k\mathbf{d}_k, \] with $k\in\mathbb{N}$ and digits $\mathbf{d}_j \in \mathcal{D}$ for $0\le j\le k$. We prove that for a given matrix $A \in M_n(\mathbb{Q})$ there is a finite set $\mathcal{D}\subset\mathbb{Z}^n[A]$ such that $(A, \mathcal{D})$ has the finiteness property if and only if $A$ has no eigenvalue of absolute value $&lt, 1$. This result is the matrix analogue of the height reducing property of algebraic numbers. In proving this result we also characterize integer polynomials $P \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ that admit digit systems having the finiteness property in the quotient ring $\mathbb{Z}[x]/(P)$.;math.NT
1801.01850;Hyperbolic HHS II: Graphs of hierarchically hyperbolic groups;In this paper we consider a large family of graphs of hierarchically hyperbolic groups (HHG) and show that their fundamental groups admit HHG structures. To do that, we will investigate the notion of hierarchical quasi convexity and show that for a hyperbolic HHS it coincides with the notion of quasi-convexity. The main technical result, for which we expect further applications, is that it is possible to incorporate the HHG structure of a hierarchically hyperbolically embedded subgroup into the HHG structure of the ambient group. This generalizes and provides some additional details to a procedure described in [DHS17].;math.GR
1801.01857;On the Kahler-Einstein metric at strictly pseudoconvex points;We prove a local boundary regularity result for the complete Kahler-Einstein metrics of negative Ricci curvature near strictly pseudoconvex boundary point. We also study the asymptotic behaviour of their holomorphic bisectional curvatures near such points.;math.DG
1801.01858;Special moves for open book decompositions of 3-manifolds;We provide a complete set of two moves that suffice to relate any two open book decompositions of a given 3-manifold. One of the moves is the usual plumbing with a positive or negative Hopf band, while the other one is a special local version of Harer's twisting, which is presented in two different (but stably equivalent) forms. Our approach relies on 4-dimensional Lefschetz fibrations, and on 3-dimensional contact topology, via the Giroux-Goodman stable equivalence theorem for open book decompositions representing homologous contact structures.;math.GT
1801.01859;The Arbitrarily Varying Relay Channel;We study the arbitrarily varying relay channel, and establish the cutset bound and partial decode-forward bound on the random code capacity. We further determine the random code capacity for special cases. Then, we consider conditions under which the deterministic code capacity is determined as well.;cs.IT
1801.01860;Controllability of the Navier-Stokes equation in a rectangle with a little help of a distributed phantom force;We consider the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation in a rectangle with the usual no-slip boundary condition prescribed on the upper and lower boundaries. We prove that for any positive time, for any finite energy initial data, there exist controls on the left and right boundaries and a distributed force, which can be chosen arbitrarily small in any Sobolev norm in space, such that the corresponding solution is at rest at the given final time. <br />Our work improves earlier results where the distributed force is small only in a negative Sobolev space. It is a further step towards an answer to Jacques-Louis Lions' question about the small-time global exact boundary controllability of the Navier-Stokes equation with the no-slip boundary condition, for which no distributed force is allowed. <br />Our analysis relies on the well-prepared dissipation method already used for Burgers and for Navier-Stokes in the case of the Navier slip-with-friction boundary condition. In order to handle the larger boundary layers associated with the no-slip boundary condition, we perform a preliminary regularization into analytic functions with arbitrarily large analytic radius and prove a long-time nonlinear Cauchy-Kovalevskaya estimate relying only on horizontal analyticity.;math.AP
1801.01864;An asymptotic bound for Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of certain Ext modules over graded complete intersection rings;Set $ A := Q/({\bf z}) $, where $ Q $ is a polynomial ring over a field, and $ {\bf z} = z_1,\ldots,z_c $ is a homogeneous $ Q $-regular sequence. Let $ M $ and $ N $ be finitely generated graded $ A $-modules, and $ I $ be a homogeneous ideal of $ A $. We show that <br />(1) $ \mathrm{reg}\left( \mathrm{Ext}_A^{i}(M, I^nN) \right) \le \rho_N(I) \cdot n - f \cdot \left\lfloor \frac{i}{2} \right\rfloor + b \mbox{ for all } i, n \ge 0 $, <br />(2) $ \mathrm{reg}\left( \mathrm{Ext}_A^{i}(M,N/I^nN) \right) \le \rho_N(I) \cdot n - f \cdot \left\lfloor \frac{i}{2} \right\rfloor + b' \mbox{ for all } i, n \ge 0 $, <br />where $ b $ and $ b' $ are some constants, $ f := \mathrm{min}\{ \mathrm{deg}(z_j) : 1 \le j \le c \} $, and $ \rho_N(I) $ is an invariant defined in terms of reduction ideals of $ I $ with respect to $ N $. There are explicit examples which show that these inequalities are sharp.;math.AC
1801.01866;The Reeb Graph Edit Distance is Universal;We consider the setting of Reeb graphs of piecewise linear functions and study distances between them that are stable, meaning that functions which are similar in the supremum norm ought to have similar Reeb graphs. We define an edit distance for Reeb graphs and prove that it is stable and universal, meaning that it provides an upper bound to any other stable distance. In contrast, via a specific construction, we show that the interleaving distance and the functional distortion distance on Reeb graphs are not universal.;math.AT
1801.01867;Limit-Periodic Schr&#xf6,dinger Operators With Lipschitz Continuous IDS;We show that there exist limit-periodic Schr\"odinger operators such that the associated integrated density of states is Lipschitz continuous. These operators arise in the inverse spectral theoretic KAM approach of P\"oschel.;math.SP
1801.01868;Multiplicity results and qualitative properties for semilinear elliptic problems with Neumann boundary conditions;In this paper we study multiplicity and qualitative behavior of solutions for semilinear elliptic problems with neumann boundary condition and asymptotically linear smooth nonlinearity. We provide sufficient conditions on the number of eigenvalues the derivative of the nonlinearity crosses to guarantee existence of at least five nontrivial solutions. The techniques we use are a combination of minimization, Leray-Schauder degree, Morse Theory and Reduction method a la Castro-Lazer.;math.AP
1801.01873;When is $X\times Y$ homeomorphic to $X\times_l Y$?;We identify a class of linearly ordered topological spaces $X$ that may satisfy the property that $X\times X$ is homeomorphic to $X\times_l X$ or can be embedded into a linearly ordered space with the stated property. We justify the conjectures by partial results.;math.GN
1801.01875;Near Optimal Coded Data Shuffling for Distributed Learning;Data shuffling between distributed cluster of nodes is one of the critical steps in implementing large-scale learning algorithms. Randomly shuffling the data-set among a cluster of workers allows different nodes to obtain fresh data assignments at each learning epoch. This process has been shown to provide improvements in the learning process. However, the statistical benefits of distributed data shuffling come at the cost of extra communication overhead from the master node to worker nodes, and can act as one of the major bottlenecks in the overall time for computation. There has been significant recent interest in devising approaches to minimize this communication overhead. One approach is to provision for extra storage at the computing nodes. The other emerging approach is to leverage coded communication to minimize the overall communication overhead. <br />The focus of this work is to understand the fundamental trade-off between the amount of storage and the communication overhead for distributed data shuffling. In this work, we first present an information theoretic formulation for the data shuffling problem, accounting for the underlying problem parameters (number of workers, $K$, number of data points, $N$, and the available storage, $S$ per node). We then present an information theoretic lower bound on the communication overhead for data shuffling as a function of these parameters. We next present a novel coded communication scheme and show that the resulting communication overhead of the proposed scheme is within a multiplicative factor of at most $\frac{K}{K-1}$ from the information-theoretic lower bound. Furthermore, we present the aligned coded shuffling scheme for some storage values, which achieves the optimal storage vs communication trade-off for $K&lt,5$, and further reduces the maximum multiplicative gap down to $\frac{K-\frac{1}{3}}{K-1}$, for $K\geq 5$.;cs.IT
1801.01878;A rank 2 Dijkgraaf-Moore-Verlinde-Verlinde formula;We conjecture a formula for the virtual elliptic genera of moduli spaces of rank 2 sheaves on minimal surfaces $S$ of general type. We express our conjecture in terms of the Igusa cusp form $\chi_{10}$ and Borcherds type lifts of three quasi-Jacobi forms which are all related to the Weierstrass elliptic function. We also conjecture that the generating function of virtual cobordism classes of these moduli spaces depends only on $\chi(\mathcal{O}_S)$ and $K_S^2$ via two universal functions, one of which is determined by the cobordism classes of Hilbert schemes of points on $K3$. We present generalizations of these conjectures, e.g. to arbitrary surfaces with $p_g&gt,0$ and $b_1=0$. <br />We use a result of J. Shen to express the virtual cobordism class in terms of descendent Donaldson invariants. In a prequel we used T. Mochizuki's formula, universality, and toric calculations to compute such Donaldson invariants in the setting of virtual $\chi_y$-genera. Similar techniques allow us to verify our new conjectures in many cases.;math.AG
1801.01897;Power Kripke-Platek set theory and the axiom of choice;Whilst Power Kripke-Platek set theory, KPP, shares many properties with ordinary Kripke-Platek set theory, KP, in several ways it behaves quite differently from KP. This is perhaps most strikingly demonstrated by a result, due to Mathias, to the effect that adding the axiom of constructibility to KPP gives rise to a much stronger theory, whereas in the case of KP the constructible hierarchy provides an inner model, so that KP and KP+V=L have the same strength. This paper will be concerned with the relationship between KPP and KPP plus the axiom of choice or even the global axiom of choice, GAC. Since L is the standard vehicle to furnish a model in which this axiom holds, the usual argument for demonstrating that the addition of AC or GAC to KPP does not increase proof-theoretic strength does not apply in any obvious way. Among other tools, the paper uses techniques from ordinal analysis to show that KPP+GAC has the same strength as KPP, thereby answering a question of Mathias. Moreover, it is shown that KPP+GAC is conservative over KPP for Pi-1-4 statements of analysis. The method of ordinal analysis for theories with power set was developed in an earlier paper. The technique allows one to compute witnessing information from infinitary proofs, providing bounds for the transfinite iterations of the power set operation that are provable in a theory. As the theory KPP+GAC provides a very useful tool for defining models and realizability models of other theories that are hard to construct without access to a uniform selection mechanism, it is desirable to determine its exact proof-theoretic strength. This knowledge can for instance be used to determine the strength of Feferman's operational set theory with power set operation as well as constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice.;math.LO
1801.01898;Natural proof of the characterization of relatively compact families in $L^p-$spaces on locally compact groups;In the paper we look for an elegant proof of the characterization of relatively compact families in $L^p-$spaces. At first glance, the suggested approach may seem convoluted and lengthy, but we spare no effort to argue that our proof is in fact more natural than the ones existent in the literature. The key idea is that the three properties which characterize relative compactness in $L^p-$spaces ($L^p-$boundedness, $L^p-$equicontinuity and $L^p-$equivanishing) are "preserved" (or rather "inherited") when the family $\Ffamily\subset L^p$ is convolved with a continuous and compactly supported function. This new family turns out to be relatively compact in $C_0-$space and it remains to be demonstrated that relative compactness in $C_0-$space implies relative compactness of the original family $\Ffamily.$;math.FA
1801.01906;Rankin-Cohen brackets and Serre derivatives as Poincar&#xe9, series;We give expressions for the Serre derivatives of Eisenstein and Poincar\'e series as well as their Rankin-Cohen brackets with arbitrary modular forms in terms of the Poincar\'e averaging construction, and derive several identities for the Ramanujan tau function as applications.;math.NT
1801.01908;Structural Logic and Abstract Elementary Classes with Intersection;We give a syntactic characterization of abstract elementary classes (AECs) closed under intersections using a new logic with a quantifier for isomorphism types that we call structural logic: we prove that AECs with intersections correspond to classes of models of a universal theory in structural logic. This generalizes Tarski's syntactic characterization of universal classes. As a corollary, we obtain that any AEC with countable L\"owenheim-Skolem number is axiomatizable in $\mathbb{L}_{\infty, \omega} (Q)$, where $Q$ is the quantifier "there exists uncountably many".;math.LO
1801.01911;Descriptive Cellular Homology;This article introduces descriptive cellular homology on cell complexes, which is an extension of J.H.C. Whitehead's CW topology. A main result is that a descriptive cellular complex is a topology on fibres in a fibre bundle. An application of two forms of cellular homology is given in terms of the persistence of shapes in CW spaces.;math.GT
1801.01915;An application of the partial r-Bell polynomials on some family of bivariate polynomials;The aim of this paper is to give some combinatorial relations linked polynomials generalizing those of Appell type to the partial r-Bell polynomials. We give an inverse relation, recurrence relations involving some family of polynomials and their exact expressions at rational values in terms of the partial r-Bell polynomials. We illustrate the obtained results by various comprehensive examples.;math.CO
1801.01917;Multiplicative operators in the spectral problem of integrable systems;We consider the spectral problem of the Lax pair associated to periodic integrable partial differential equations. We assume this spectral problem to be a polynomial of degree $d$ in the spectral parameter $\lambda$. From this assumption, we find the conservation laws as well as the hyperelliptic curve required to solve the periodic inverse problem. A recursion formula is developed, as well as $d$ additional conditions which give additional information to integrate the equations under consideration. We also include two examples to show how the techniques developed work. For the Korteweg-deVries (KdV) equation, the degree of the multiplicative equation is $d=1$. Hence, we only have one condition and one recursion formula. The condition gives in each degree of the recursion the conserved densities for KdV equation, recovering the Lax hierarchy. For the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation, the degree of the multiplicative operator is $d=2$. Hence, we have a couple of conditions that we use to deduce conserved density constants and the Lax hierarchy for such equation. Additionally, we explicitely write down the hyper-elliptic curve associted to the NLS equation. Our approach can be use for other completely integrable differential equations, as long as we have a polynomial multiplicative operator associated to them.;math.AP
1801.01918;Homogenization of some degenerate pseudoparabolic variational inequalities;Multiscale analysis of a degenerate pseudoparabolic variational inequality, modelling the two-phase flow with dynamical capillary pressure in a perforated domain, is the main topic of this work. Regularisation and penalty operator methods are applied to show the existence of a solution of the nonlinear degenerate pseudoparabolic variational inequality defined in a domain with microscopic perforations, as well as to derive a priori estimates for solutions of the microscopic problem. The main challenge is the derivation of a priori estimates for solutions of the variational inequality, uniformly with respect to the regularisation parameter and to the small parameter defining the scale of the microstructure. The method of two-scale convergence is used to derive the corresponding macroscopic obstacle problem.;math.AP
1801.01924;Green matrix estimates of block Jacobi matrices I: Unbounded gap in the essential spectrum;This work deals with decay bounds for Green matrices and generalized eigenvectors of block Jacobi matrices when the real part of the spectral parameter lies in an infinite gap of the operator's essential spectrum. We consider the cases of commutative and noncommutative matrix entries separately. An example of a block Jacobi operator with noncommutative entries and nonnegative essential spectrum is given to illustrate the results.;math-ph
1801.01925;The reciprocal sum of primitive nondeficient numbers;We investigate the reciprocal sum of primitive nondeficient numbers, or pnds. In 1934, Erdos showed that the reciprocal sum of pnds converges, which he used to prove that the abundant numbers have a natural density. We show the reciprocal sum of pnds is between 0.348 and 0.380.;math.NT
1801.01931;Magnetic oscillations in a model of graphene;We consider a quantum graph as a model of graphene in constant magnetic field and describe the density of states in terms of relativistic Landau levels satisfying a Bohr--Sommerfeld quantization condition. That provides semiclassical corrections (with the magnetic flux as the semiclassical parameter) in the study of magnetic oscillations.;math-ph
1801.01934;Universality results for kinetically constrained spin models in two dimensions;Kinetically constrained models (KCM) are reversible interacting particle systems on $\mathbb Z^d$ with continuous time Markov dynamics of Glauber type, which represent a natural stochastic (and non-monotone) counterpart of the family of cellular automata known as $\mathcal U$-bootstrap percolation. KCM also display some of the peculiar features of the so-called "glassy dynamics", and as such they are extensively used in the physics literature to model the liquid-glass transition, a major and longstanding open problem in condensed matter physics. <br />We consider two-dimensional KCM with update rule $\mathcal U$, and focus on proving universality results for the mean infection time of the origin, in the same spirit as those recently established in the setting of $\mathcal U$-bootstrap percolation. We first identify what we believe are the correct universality classes, which turn out to be different from those of $\mathcal U$-bootstrap percolation. We then prove universal upper bounds on the mean infection time within each class, which we conjecture to be sharp up to logarithmic corrections. In certain cases, including all supercritical models, and the well-known Duarte model, our conjecture has recently been confirmed in [MMT]. In fact, in these cases our upper bound is sharp up to a constant factor in the exponent. For certain classes of update rules, it turns out that the infection time of the KCM diverges much faster than for the corresponding $\mathcal U$-bootstrap process when the equilibrium density of infected sites goes to zero. This is due to the occurrence of energy barriers which determine the dominant behaviour for KCM, but which do not matter for the monotone bootstrap dynamics.;math.PR
1801.01938;A note on Arithmetic Diophantine series;We consider some asymptotic analysis for series related to the work of Hardy and Littlewood on Diophantine approximation, as well as Davenport. In particular, we expand on ideas from some previous work on arithmetic series and the RH.;math.NT
1801.01940;A spiral interface with positive Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman limit at the origin;We give an example of a pair of nonnegative subharmonic functions with disjoint support for which the Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman monotonicity formula has strictly positive limit at the origin, and yet the interface between their supports lacks a (unique) tangent there. This clarifies a remark appearing in the literature (see \cite{cs05}) that the positivity of the limit of the ACF formula implies unique tangents, this is true under some additional assumptions, but false in general. In our example, blow-ups converge to the expected piecewise linear two-plane function along subsequences, but the limiting function depends on the subsequence due to the spiraling nature of the interface.;math.AP
