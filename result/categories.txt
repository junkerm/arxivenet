1801.00020;K-theory and actions on Euclidean retracts;This note surveys axiomatic results for the Farrell-Jones Conjecture in terms of actions on Euclidean retracts and applications of these to GL_n(Z), relative hyperbolic groups and mapping class groups.;math.KT
1801.00023;Exceptional sets for nonuniformly hyperbolic diffeomorphisms;For a surface diffeomorphism, a compact invariant locally maximal set $W$ and some subset $A\subset W$ we study the $A$-exceptional set, that is, the set of points whose orbits do not accumulate at $A$. We show that if the Hausdorff dimension of $A$ is smaller than the Hausdorff dimension $d$ of some ergodic hyperbolic measure, then the topological entropy of the exceptional set is at least the entropy of this measure and its Hausdorff dimension is at least $d$. Particular consequences occur when there is some a priori defined hyperbolic structure on $W$ and, for example, if there exists an SRB measure.;math.DS
1801.00024;On the topological equivalence of S-metric and cone S-metric spaces;The aim of this paper is to establish the equivalence between the concepts of an $S$-metric space and a cone $S$-metric space using\ some topological approaches. We introduce a new notion of $TVS$-cone $S$-metric space using some facts about topological vector spaces. We see that the known results on cone $S$-metric spaces (or $N$-cone metric spaces) can be directly obtained from the studies on $S$-metric spaces.;math.GN
1801.00028;Smooth quotients of abelian varieties by finite groups;We give a complete classification of smooth quotients of abelian varieties by finite groups that fix the origin. In the particular case where the action of the group $G$ on the tangent space at the origin of the abelian variety $A$ is irreducible, we prove that $A$ is isomorphic to the self-product of an elliptic curve and $A/G\simeq \mathbb P^n$. In the general case, assuming $\dim(A^G)=0$, we prove that $A/G$ is isomorphic to a direct product of projective spaces.;math.AG
1801.00029;Graded Expectations: Betti numbers and anti-lecture hall compositions of random threshold graphs;This paper examines the one-to-one-to-one correspondence between threshold graphs, Betti numbers of quotients of polynomial rings by 2-linear ideals, and anti-lecture hall compositions. In particular, we establish new explicit combinatorial mappings between each of these classes of objects and calculate the expected values of the Betti numbers and anti-lecture hall composition corresponding to a random threshold graph.;math.CO
1801.00032;On uniqueness of end sums and 1-handles at infinity;For oriented manifolds of dimension at least 4 that are simply connected at infinity, it is known that end summing is a uniquely defined operation. Calcut and Haggerty showed that more complicated fundamental group behavior at infinity can lead to nonuniqueness. The present paper examines how and when uniqueness fails. Examples are given, in the categories TOP, PL and DIFF, of nonuniqueness that cannot be detected in a weaker category (including the homotopy category). In contrast, uniqueness is proved for Mittag-Leffler ends, and generalized to allow slides and cancellation of (possibly infinite) collections of 0- and 1-handles at infinity. Various applications are presented, including an analysis of how the monoid of smooth manifolds homeomorphic to R^4 acts on the smoothings of any noncompact 4-manifold.;math.GT
1801.00033;Concerning $q$-summable Szlenk index;For each ordinal $\xi$ and each $1\leqslant q&lt,\infty$, we define the notion of $\xi$-$q$-summable Szlenk index. When $\xi=0$ and $q=1$, this recovers the usual notion of summable Szlenk index. We define for an arbitrary weak$^*$-compact set a transfinite, asymptotic analogue $\alpha_{\xi,p}$ of the martingale type norm of an operator. We prove that this quantity is determined by norming sets and determines $\xi$-Szlenk power type and $\xi$-$q$-summability of Szlenk index. This fact allows us to prove that the behavior of operators under the $\alpha_{\xi,p}$ seminorms passes in the strongest way to injective tensor products of Banach spaces. Furthermore, we combine this fact with a result of Schlumprecht to prove that a separable Banach space with good behavior with respect to the $\alpha_{\xi,p}$ seminorm can be embedded into a Banach space with a shrinking basis and the same behavior under $\alpha_{\xi,p}$, and in particular it can be embedded into a Banach space with a shrinking basis and the same $\xi$-Szlenk power type. Finally, we completely elucidate the behavior of the $\alpha_{\xi,p}$ seminorms under $\ell_r$ direct sums. This allows us to give an alternative proof of a result of Brooker regarding Szlenk indices of $\ell_p$ and $c_0$ direct sums of operators.;math.FA
1801.00034;Mean field matching and TSP in pseudo-dimension 1;Recent work on optimization problems in random link models has verified several conjectures originating in statistical physics and the replica and cavity methods. In particular the numerical value 2.0415 for the limit length of a traveling salesman tour in a complete graph with uniform $[0,1]$ edge lengths has been established. <br />In this paper we show that the crucial integral equation obtained with the cavity method has a unique solution, and that the limit ground state energy obtained from this solution agrees with the rigorously derived value. Moreover, the method by which we establish uniqueness of the solution turns out to yield a new completely rigorous derivation of the limit.;math.PR
1801.00037;On linear sections of the spinor tenfold, I;We discuss the geometry of transverse linear sections of the spinor tenfold $X$, the connected component of the orthogonal Grassmannian of 5-dimensional isotropic subspaces in a 10-dimensional vector space equipped with a non-degenerate quadratic form. In particular, we show that as soon as the dimension of a linear section of $X$ is at least 5, its integral Chow motive is of Lefschetz type. We discuss classification of smooth linear sections of $X$ of small codimension, in particular we check that there is a unique isomorphism class of smooth hyperplane sections and exactly two isomorphism classes of smooth linear sections of codimension 2. Using this, we define a natural quadratic line complex associated with a linear section of $X$. We also discuss the Hilbert schemes of linear spaces and quadrics on $X$ and its linear sections.;math.AG
1801.00038;Identifiability of two-component skew normal mixtures with one known component;We give sufficient identifiability conditions for estimating mixing proportions in two-component mixtures of skew normal distributions with one known component. We consider the univariate case as well as two multivariate extensions: a multivariate skew normal distribution (MSN) by Azzalini and Dalla Valle (1996) and the canonical fundamental skew normal distribution (CFUSN) by Arellano-Valle and Genton (2005). The characteristic function of the CFUSN distribution is additionally derived.;math.ST
1801.00039;Inverse scattering for the massive Thirring model;We consider the massive Thirring model in the laboratory coordinates and explain how the inverse scattering transform can be developed with the Riemann-Hilbert approach. The key ingredient of our method is to transform the corresponding spectral problem to the equivalent forms: one is suitable for the spectral parameter at the origin and the other one is suitable for the spectral parameter at infinity. Global solutions to the massive Thirring model are recovered from the reconstruction formulae at the origin and at infinity.;math.AP
1801.00043;Network Deployment for Maximal Energy Efficiency in Uplink with Multislope Path Loss;This work aims to design the uplink (UL) of a cellular network for maximal energy efficiency (EE). Each base station (BS) is randomly deployed within a given area and is equipped with $M$ antennas to serve $K$ user equipments (UEs). A multislope (distance-dependent) path loss model is considered and linear processing is used, under the assumption that channel state information is acquired by using pilot sequences (reused across the network). Within this setting, a lower bound on the UL spectral efficiency and a realistic circuit power consumption model are used to evaluate the network EE. Numerical results are first used to compute the optimal BS density and pilot reuse factor for a Massive MIMO network with three different detection schemes, namely, maximum ratio combining, zero-forcing (ZF) and multicell minimum mean-squared error. The numerical analysis shows that the EE is a unimodal function of BS density and achieves its maximum for a relatively small density of BS, irrespective of the employed detection scheme. This is in contrast to the single-slope (distance-independent) path loss model, for which the EE is a monotonic non-decreasing function of BS density. Then, we concentrate on ZF and use stochastic geometry to compute a new lower bound on the spectral efficiency, which is then used to optimize, for a given BS density, the pilot reuse factor, number of BS antennas and UEs. Closed- form expressions are computed from which valuable insights into the interplay between optimization variables, hardware characteristics, and propagation environment are obtained.;cs.IT
1801.00044;Cyclic descents for near-hook and two-row shapes;A notion of cyclic descents on standard Young tableaux (SYT) of rectangular shape was introduced by Rhoades, and extended to certain skew shapes by the last two authors. The cyclic descent set restricts to the usual descent set when the largest value is ignored, and has the property that the number of SYT of a given shape with a given cyclic descent set $D$ is invariant under cyclic shifts of the entries of $D$. Following these results, the existence of cyclic descent sets for standard Young tableaux of any skew shape other than a ribbon was conjectured by the authors, and recently proved by Adin, Reiner and Roichman. Unfortunately, the proof does not provide a natural definition of the cyclic descent set for a specific tableau. <br />In this paper we explicitly describe cyclic descent sets and resulting generating functions for SYT of (possibly skew) shapes which either have exactly two rows or are near-hooks, i.e., are one cell away from a hook. Our definition provides a constructive combinatorial proof of the existence of cyclic descent sets for these shapes, and coincides with that of Rhoades for two-row rectangular shapes. We also show that cyclic descent sets for near-hook shaped tableaux are unique.;math.CO
1801.00045;Webs of type Q;We introduce web supercategories of type Q. We describe the structure of these categories and show they have a symmetric braiding. The main result of the paper shows these diagrammatically defined monoidal supercategories provide combinatorial models for the monoidal supercategories generated by the supersymmetric tensor powers of the natural supermodule for the Lie superalgebra of type Q.;math.RT
1801.00051;Stability Analysis of Coupled Structural Acoustics PDE Models under Thermal Effects and with no Additional Dissipation;In this study we consider a coupled system of partial differential equations (PDE's) which describes a certain structural acoustics interaction. One component of this PDE system is a wave equation, which serves to model the interior acoustic wave medium within a given three dimensional chamber $% \Omega $. This acoustic wave equation is coupled on a boundary interface ($% \Gamma _{0}$) to a two dimensional system of thermoelasticity: this thermoelastic PDE comprises a structural beam or plate equation, which governs the vibrations of flexible wall portion $\Gamma _{0}$ of the chamber $\Omega $, the elastic dynamics is coupled to a heat equation which also evolves on $\Gamma _{0}$, and which imparts a thermal damping onto the entire structural acoustic system. As we said, the interaction between the wave and thermoelastic PDE components takes place on the boundary interface $% \Gamma _{0}$, and involves coupling boundary terms which are above the level of finite energy. We analyze the stability properties of this coupled structural acoustics PDE model, in the absence of \ any additive feedback dissipation on the hard walls $\Gamma _{1}$ of the boundary $\partial \Omega $. Under a certain geometric assumption on $\Gamma _{1}$, an assumption which has appeared in the literature in conection with structural acoustic flow, and which allows for the invocation of a recently derived microlocal boundary trace estimate, we show that classical solutions of this thermally damped structural acoustics PDE decay uniformly to zero, with a rational rate of decay.;math.AP
1801.00053;From analytical mechanical problems to rewriting theory through M. Janet;This note surveys the historical background of the Gr\"obner basis theory for D-modules and linear rewriting theory. The objective is to present a deep interaction of these two fields largely developed in algebra throughout the twentieth century. We recall the work of M. Janet on the algebraic analysis on linear partial differential systems that leads to the notion of involutive division. We present some generalizations of the division introduced by M. Janet and their relations with Gr\"obner basis theory.;math.HO
1801.00057;Preservation of Trees by semidirect Products;We show that the semidirect product of a group $C$ by $A*_D B$ is isomorphic to the free product of $A\rtimes C$ and $B\rtimes C$ amalgamated at $D\rtimes C$, where $A$, $B$ and $C$ are arbitrary groups. Moreover, we apply this theorem to prove that any group $G$ that acts without inversion on a tree $T$ that possesses a segment $\Gamma$ for its quotient graph, such that, if the stabilizers of the vertex set $\{\,P,Q\,\}$ and edge $y$ of a lift of $\, \Gamma$ in $T$ are of the form $G_{P}\!\rtimes H$, $G_{Q}\!\rtimes H$ and $G_{y}\! \rtimes H$, then $G$ is isomorphic to the semidirect product of $H$ by $(\,G_P \,*_{G_y} \,G_Q \,)$. <br />Using our results we conclude with a non-standard verification of the isomorphism between $GL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ and the free product of the dihedral groups $D_4$ and $D_6$ amalgamated at their Klein-four group.;math.GR
1801.00058;A simple mathematical model for unemployment: a case study in Portugal with optimal control;We propose a simple mathematical model for unemployment. Despite its simpleness, we claim that the model is more realistic and useful than recent models available in the literature. A case study with real data from Portugal supports our claim. An optimal control problem is formulated and solved, which provides some non-trivial and interesting conclusions.;math.OC
1801.00066;Normally hyperbolic surfaces based finite-time transient stability monitoring of power system dynamics;In this paper, we develop a methodology for finite time rotor angle stability analysis using the theory of normal hyperbolic surfaces. The proposed method would bring new insights to the existing techniques, which are based on asymptotic analysis. For the finite time analysis we have adopted the Theory of normally hyperbolic surfaces. We have connected the repulsion rates of the normally hyperbolic surfaces, to the finite time stability. Also, we have characterized the region of stability over finite time window. The parallels have been drawn with the existing tools for asymptotic analysis. Also, we have proposed a model free method for online stability monitoring.;math.OC
1801.00068;Contingency Analysis of Power Networks : A System Theoretic Approach;In this work, we have proposed a system theoretic method to compute sensitivities of different lines for $N-k$ contingency analysis in power network. We have formulated the $N-k$ contingency analysis as the stability problem of power network with uncertain links. We have derived a necessary condition for stochastic stability of the power network with the link uncertainty. The necessary condition is then used to rank order the contingencies. We have shown due to interaction between different uncertainties the ranking can substantially change. The state of the art $N-k$ contingency analysis does not consider the possibility of interference between link uncertainties and rank the links according to the severity of $N-1$ contingencies. We have presented simulation results for New England $39$ bus system as a support of our claim.;math.OC
1801.00070;Sum of squares certificates for stability of planar, homogeneous, and switched systems;We show that existence of a global polynomial Lyapunov function for a homogeneous polynomial vector field or a planar polynomial vector field (under a mild condition) implies existence of a polynomial Lyapunov function that is a sum of squares (sos) and that the negative of its derivative is also a sum of squares. This result is extended to show that such sos-based certificates of stability are guaranteed to exist for all stable switched linear systems. For this class of systems, we further show that if the derivative inequality of the Lyapunov function has an sos certificate, then the Lyapunov function itself is automatically a sum of squares. These converse results establish cases where semidefinite programming is guaranteed to succeed in finding proofs of Lyapunov inequalities. Finally, we demonstrate some merits of replacing the sos requirement on a polynomial Lyapunov function with an sos requirement on its top homogeneous component. In particular, we show that this is a weaker algebraic requirement in addition to being cheaper to impose computationally.;math.OC
1801.00072;Invariant submanifolds for affine control systems;Given an affine control system $\dot{\mathbf x} = f({\mathbf x}) + \sum_{j=1}^m g_j({\mathbf x}) u_j$ we present an algorithmic process of construction of submanifolds that are invariant under controls assuming that the linear span of $f, g_1, \ldots, g_m$ has constant rank. We use the method of reduction of Pfaffian systems to a largest integrable subsystem and finding the first integrals and the generalized first integrals for the vector fields.;math.DS
1801.00079;HDG-POD Reduced Order Model of the Heat Equation;We propose a new hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) model order reduction technique based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). We consider the heat equation as a test problem and prove error bounds that converge to zero as the number of POD modes increases. We present 2D and 3D numerical results to illustrate the convergence analysis.;math.NA
1801.00081;Validity of formal expansions for singularly perturbed competition-diffusion systems;We consider a two-species competition-diffusion system involving a small parameter $\varepsilon&gt,0$ and discuss the validity of formal asymptotic expansions of solutions near the sharp interface limit $\varepsilon\approx0$. We assume that the corresponding ODE system has two stable equilibria. As in the scalar Allen--Cahn equation, it is known that the motion of the sharp interfaces of such systems is governed by the mean curvature flow with a driving force. The formal expansion also suggests that the profile of the transition layers converges to that of a traveling wave solution as $\varepsilon\rightarrow0$. In this paper, we rigorously verify this latter ansatz for a large class of initial data. <br />The proof relies on a rescaling argument, the super--subsolution method and a Liouville type theorem for eternal solutions of parabolic systems. Roughly speaking, the Liouville type theorem states that any eternal solution that lies between two traveling waves is itself a traveling wave. The same Liouville type theorem was established for the scalar Allen--Cahn equation by Berestycki and Hamel. In view of their importance, we prove the Liouville type theorems in a rather general framework, not only for two-species competition-diffusion systems but also for $m$-species cooperation-diffusion systems possibly with time periodic or spatially periodic coefficients.;math.AP
1801.00082;An HDG Method for Distributed Control of Convection Diffusion PDEs;We propose a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method to approximate the solution of a distributed optimal control problem governed by an elliptic convection diffusion PDE. We derive optimal a priori error estimates for the state, adjoint state, their fluxes, and the optimal control. We present 2D and 3D numerical experiments to illustrate our theoretical results.;math.NA
1801.00088;On optimal periodic dividend and capital injection strategies for spectrally negative L&#xe9,vy models;De Finetti's optimal dividend problem has recently been extended to the case dividend payments can only be made at Poisson arrival times. This paper considers the version with bail-outs where the surplus must be nonnegative uniformly in time. For a general spectrally negative L\'evy model, we show the optimality of a Parisian-classical reflection strategy that pays the excess above a given barrier at each Poisson arrival times and also reflects from below at zero in the classical sense.;math.PR
1801.00089;Essential dimension of finite groups in prime characteristic;Given a finite smooth group scheme $G$ over a field of characteristic $p &gt, 0$, we show that the essential dimension of $G$ at $p$ is $0$ when $p$ does not divide the order of $G$, and $1$ when it does.;math.GR
1801.00097;Hidden constructions in abstract algebra. Krull Dimension of distributive lattices and commutative rings;We present constructive versions of Krull's dimension theory for commutative rings and distributive lattices. The foundations of these constructive versions are due to Joyal, Espa\~nol and the authors. We show that the notion of Krull dimension has an explicit computational content in the form of existence (or lack of existence) of some algebraic identities. We can then get an explicit computational content where abstract results about dimensions are used to show the existence of concrete elements. This can be seen as a partial realisation of Hilbert's program for classical abstract commutative algebra.;math.AC
1801.00099;Null structures and degenerate dispersion relations in two space dimensions;Motivated by water-wave problems, in this paper we consider a class of nonlinear dispersive PDEs in 2D with cubic nonlinearities, whose dispersion relations are radial and have vanishing Guassian curvature on a circle. For such a model we identify certain null structures for the cubic nonlinearity, which suffice in order to guarantee global scattering solutions for the small data problem. Our null structures in the power-type nonlinearity are weak, and only eliminate the worst nonlinear interaction. Such null structures arise naturally in some water-wave problems.;math.AP
1801.00104;Global attractors for the damped nonlinear wave equation in unbounded domains;The existence of a global attractor for wave equations in unbounded domains is a challenging problem due to the non-compactness of the Sobolev embeddings. To overcome this difficulty, some authors have worked with weighted Sobolev spaces which restrict the choice of the initial data. Using the "tail estimation method" introduced by B. Wang for reaction diffusion equations, we establish in this paper the existence of a global attractor for two wave equations in the traditional Hilbert spaces $\displaystyle H^1(\Omega)\times L^2(\Omega)$ where $\Omega$ is an unbounded domain of $\R^N$. The first equation, with a mass term is studied in the whole space $\R^N$ and the second one without mass term is considered in a domain bounded in only one direction so that Poincar\'e inequality will hold.;math.AP
1801.00106;Content Placement in Cache Networks Using Graph-Coloring;Small cell densification is one of the effective ideas addressing the demand for higher capacity in cellular networks. The major problem faced in such networks is the wireless backhaul link and its limited capacity. Caching most popular files in the memories of small cells base station (SBSs) is an effective solution to this problem. One of the main challenges in caching is choosing the files that are going to be stored in the memory of SBS. In this paper, we model the described caching problem as a graph. This graph is divided into four sub-graphs including placement, access, SBSs and delivery graphs. By making some modifications to the SBS graph, we convert it to a graph that can be colored. Coloring of the generated graph is NP-hard and we use an algorithm proposed in graph-coloring area to color it. To overcome the complexity of above coloring technique, we then propose a simple graph-coloring method based on two point processes, Matern Core-type I and II. We model our network with a new weighted graph which simply can be colored and after that the files are cached accordingly. We evaluate the performance of our proposed methods through simulations. Our results show that by employing out proposed method in a typical considered SBSs network, the load on the macro base station can be reduced by around $25 \%$, at the distribution parameter of popularity of files equals to $0.6$, compared to conventional policy which caches the most popular content every where.;cs.IT
1801.00107;Quasi-units as orthogonal projections;The notion of quasi-unit has been introduced by Yosida in unital Riesz spaces. Later on, a fruitful potential theoretic generalization was obtained by Arsove and Leutwiler. Due to the work of Eriksson and Leutwiler, this notion also turned out to be an effective tool by investigating the extreme structure of operator segments. This paper has multiple purposes which are interwoven, and are intended to be equally important. On the one hand, we identify quasi-units as orthogonal projections acting on an appropriate auxiliary Hilbert space. As projections form a lattice and are extremal points of the effect algebra, we conclude the same properties for quasi-units. Our second aim is to apply these results for nonnegative sesquilinear forms. Constructing an order preserving bijection between operator- and form segments, we provide a characterization of being extremal in the convexity sense, and we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the greatest lower bound of two forms. Closing the paper we revisit some statements by using the machinery developed by Hassi, Sebesty\'en, and de Snoo. It will turn out that quasi-units are exactly the closed elements with respect to the antitone Galois connection induced by parallel addition and subtraction.;math.FA
1801.00109;Finite field analogue of restriction theorem for general measures;We study restriction problem in vector spaces over finite fields. We obtain finite field analogue of Mockenhaupt-Mitsis-Bak-Seenger restriction theorem, and we show that the range of the exponentials is sharp.;math.CA
1801.00111;Inverting non-invertible trees;If a graph has a non-singular adjacency matrix, then one may use the inverse matrix to define a (labeled) graph that may be considered to be the inverse graph to the original one. It has been known that an adjacency matrix of a tree is non-singular if and only if the tree has a unique perfect matching, in this case the determinant of the matrix turns out to be $\pm 1$ and the inverse of the tree was shown to be `switching-equivalent' to a simple graph [C. Godsil, Inverses of Trees, Combinatorica 5 (1985), 33--39]. Using generalized inverses of symmetric matrices (that coincide with Moore-Penrose, Drazin, and group inverses in the symmetric case) we prove a formula for determining a `generalized inverse' of a tree.;math.CO
1801.00113;A generalization of Neumann&#x27,s Question;Let $G$ be a group, $m\geq2$ and $n\geq1$. We say that $G$ is an $\mathcal{T}(m,n)$-group if for every $m$ subsets $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_m$ of $G$ of cardinality $n$, there exists $i\neq j$ and $x_i \in X_i, x_j \in X_j$ such that $x_ix_j=x_jx_i$. In this paper, we give some examples of finite and infinite non-abelian $\mathcal{T}(m,n)$-groups and we discuss finiteness and commutativity of such groups. We also show solvability length of a solvable $\mathcal{T}(m,n)$-group is bounded in terms of $m$ and $n$.;math.GR
1801.00117;A New Sparsification and Reconstruction Strategy for Compressed Sensing Photoacoustic Tomography;Compressed sensing (CS) is a promising approach to reduce the number of measurements in photoacoustic tomography (PAT) while preserving high spatial resolution. This allows to increase the measurement speed and to reduce system costs. Instead of collecting point-wise measurements, in CS one uses various combinations of pressure values at different sensor locations. Sparsity is the main condition allowing to recover the photoacoustic (PA) source from compressive measurements. In this paper we introduce a new concept enabling sparse recovery in CS PAT. Our approach is based on the fact that the second time derivative applied to the measured pressure data corresponds to the application of the Laplacian to the original PA source. As typical PA sources consist of smooth parts and singularities along interfaces the Laplacian of the source is sparse (or at least compressible). To efficiently exploit the induced sparsity we develop a reconstruction framework to jointly recover the initial and the modified sparse source. Reconstruction results with simulated as well as experimental data are given.;math.NA
1801.00120;Asymptotic expansion of Skorohod integrals;Asymptotic expansion of the distribution of a perturbation $Z_n$ of a Skorohod integral jointly with a reference variable $X_n$ is derived. We introduce a second-order interpolation formula in frequency domain to expand a characteristic functional and combine it with the scheme developed in the martingale expansion. The second-order interpolation and Fourier inversion give asymptotic expansion of the expectation $E[f(Z_n,X_n)]$ for differentiable functions $f$ and also measurable functions $f$. In the latter case, the interpolation method connects the two non-degeneracies of variables for finite $n$ and $\infty$. Random symbols are used for expressing the asymptotic expansion formula. Quasi tangent, quasi torsion and modified quasi torsion are introduced in this paper. We identify these random symbols for a certain quadratic form of a fractional Brownian motion and for a quadratic from of a fractional Brownian motion with random weights. For a quadratic form of a Brownian motion with random weights, we observe that our formula reproduces the formula originally obtained by the martingale expansion.;math.PR
1801.00121;Resource Allocation for Downlink NOMA Systems: Key Techniques and Open Issues;This article presents advances in resource allocation (RA) for downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems, focusing on user pairing (UP) and power allocation (PA) algorithms. The former pairs the users to obtain the high capacity gain by exploiting the channel gain difference between the users, while the later allocates power to users in each cluster to balance system throughput and user fairness. Additionally, the article introduces the concept of cluster fairness and proposes the divideand- next largest difference-based UP algorithm to distribute the capacity gain among the NOMA clusters in a controlled manner. Furthermore, performance comparison between multiple-input multiple-output NOMA (MIMO-NOMA) and MIMO-OMA is conducted when users have pre-defined quality of service. Simulation results are presented, which validate the advantages of NOMA over OMA. Finally, the article provides avenues for further research on RA for downlink NOMA.;cs.IT
1801.00123;Frobenius manifolds and quantum groups;We introduce isomonodromy Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) connections with respect to the quantum Stokes matrices, and prove that the classical limit of the KZ type connections gives rise to the Dubrovin connections of semisimple Frobenius manifolds and flat F-manifolds.;math-ph
1801.00124;Escaping Fatou components of transcendental self-maps of the punctured plane;We study the iteration of transcendental self-maps of $\mathbb{C}^*:=\mathbb{C}\setminus \{0\}$, that is, holomorphic functions $f:\mathbb{C}^*\to\mathbb{C}^*$ for which both zero and infinity are essential singularities. We use approximation theory to construct functions in this class with escaping Fatou components, both wandering domains and Baker domains, that accumulate to $\{0,\infty\}$ in any possible way under iteration. We also give the first explicit examples of transcendental self-maps of $\mathbb{C}^*$ with Baker domains and with wandering domains. In doing so, we developed a sufficient condition for a function to have a simply connected escaping wandering domain. Finally, we remark that our results also provide new examples of entire functions with escaping Fatou components.;math.DS
1801.00131;On the structure of zero-sum free set with minimum subset sums in abelian groups;Let $G$ be an additive abelian group and $S\subset G$ a subset. Let $\Sigma(S)$ denote the set of group elements which can be expressed as a sum of a nonempty subset of $S$. We say $S$ is zero-sum free if $0 \not\in \Sigma(S)$. It was conjectured by R.B.~Eggleton and P.~Erd\"{o}s in 1972 and proved by W.~Gao et. al. in 2008 that $|\Sigma(S)|\geq 19$ provided that $S$ is a zero-sum free subset of an abelian group $G$ with $|S|=6$. In this paper, we determined the structure of zero-sum free set $S$ where $|S|=6$ and $|\Sigma(S)|=19$.;math.CO
1801.00137;Frequency-driven market mechanisms for optimal dispatch in power networks;This paper studies real-time bidding mechanisms for economic dispatch and frequency regulation in electrical power networks. We consider a market administered by an independent system operator (ISO) where a group of strategic generators participate in a Bertrand game of competition. Generators bid prices at which they are willing to produce electricity. Each generator aims to maximize their profit, while the ISO seeks to minimize the total generation cost and to regulate the frequency of the system. We consider a continuous-time bidding process coupled with the swing dynamics of the network through the use of frequency as a feedback signal for the negotiation process. We analyze the stability of the resulting interconnected system, establishing frequency regulation and the convergence to a Nash equilibrium and optimal generation levels. The results are verified in the IEEE 14-bus benchmark case.;math.OC

We show that, contrary to the autonomous systems on the compact interval, positivity of topological sequence entropy and occurrence of Li-Yorke chaos are not equivalent, more precisely, neither of the two possible implications is true.;math.DS
1801.00140;Moment measures and stability for Gaussian inequalities;Let $\gamma$ be the standard Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and let $\mathcal{P}_{\gamma}$ be the space of probability measures that are absolutely continuous with respect to $\gamma$. We study lower bounds for the functional $\mathcal{F}_{\gamma}(\mu) = {\rm Ent}(\mu) - \frac{1}{2} W^2_2(\mu, \nu)$, where $\mu \in \mathcal{P}_{\gamma}, \nu \in \mathcal{P}_{\gamma}$, ${\rm Ent}(\mu) = \int \log\bigl( \frac{\mu}{\gamma}\bigr) d \mu$ is the relative Gaussian entropy, and $W_2$ is the quadratic Kantorovich distance. The minimizers of $\mathcal{F}_{\gamma}$ are solutions to a dimension-free Gaussian analog of the (real) K\"ahler-Einstein equation. We show that $\mathcal{F}_{\gamma}(\mu) $ is bounded from below under the assumption that the Gaussian Fisher information of $\nu$ is finite and prove a priori estimates for the minimizers. Our approach relies on certain stability estimates for the Gaussian log-Sobolev and Talagrand transportation inequalities.;math.FA
1801.00143;Paired wreaths: towards a 2-categorical atlas of cross products;After we introduced biwreaths and biwreath-like objects in our previous paper, in the present one we define paired wreaths. In a paired wreath there is a monad $B$ and a comonad $F$ over the same 0-cell in a 2-category $\K$, so that $F$ is a left wreath around $B$ and $B$ is a right cowreath around $F$, and moreover, $FB$ is a bimonad in $\K$. The corresponding 1-cell $FB$ in the setting of a biwreath and a biwreath-like object was not necessarilly a bimonad. We obtain a 2-categorical version of the Radford biproduct and Sweedler's crossed (co)product, that are on one hand, both a biwreath and a biwreath-like object, respectively, and on the other hand, they are also paired wreaths. We show that many known crossed (bi)products in the literature are special cases of paired wreaths, including cocycle cross product bialgebras of Bespalov and Drabant in braided monoidal categories. This is a part of a project of constructing a kind of a 2-categorical atlas of all the known crossed (bi)products. We introduce a Hopf datum in $\K$ which contains part of the structure of a paired wreath. We define Yang-Baxter equations and naturality conditions of certain distributive laws in $\K$ and study when Hopf data are paired wreaths. From the notion of a Hopf datum new definitions of Yetter-Drinfel`d modules, (co)module (co)monads, 2-(co)cycles and (co)cycle twisted (co)actions in a 2-categorical setting are suggested.;math.QA
1801.00144;Ground-state energy of one-dimensional free Fermi gases in the thermodynamic limit;We study the ground-state energy of one-dimensional, non-interacting fermions subject to an external potential in the thermodynamic limit. To this end, we fix some (Fermi) energy $\nu&gt,0$, confine fermions with total energy below $\nu$ inside the interval $[-L,L]$ and study the shift of the ground-state energy due to the potential $V$ in the thermodynamic limit $L\to\infty$. We show that the difference $\mathcal{E}_L(\nu)$ of the two ground-state energies with and without potential can be decomposed into a term of order one (leading to the Fumi-term) and a term of order $1/L$, which yields the so-called finite size energy. We compute both terms for all possible boundary conditions explicitly and express them through the scattering data of the one-particle Schr\"odinger operator $-\Delta +V$ on $L^2(\mathbb R)$.;math-ph
1801.00145;Dynamic Interference Steering in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks;With the development of diverse wireless communication technologies, interference has become a key impediment in network performance, thus making effective interference management (IM) essential to accommodate a rapidly increasing number of subscribers with diverse services. Although there have been numerous IM schemes proposed thus far, none of them are free of some form of cost. It is, therefore, important to balance the benefit brought by and cost of each adopted IM scheme by adapting its operating parameters to various network deployments and dynamic channel conditions. <br />We propose a novel IM scheme, called dynamic interference steering (DIS), by recognizing the fact that interference can be not only suppressed or mitigated but also steered in a particular direction. Specifically, DIS exploits both channel state information (CSI) and the data contained in the interfering signal to generate a signal that modifies the spatial feature of the original interference to partially or fully cancel the interference appearing at the victim receiver. By intelligently determining the strength of the steering signal, DIS can steer the interference in an optimal direction to balance the transmitter's power used for IS and the desired signal's transmission. DIS is shown via simulation to be able to make better use of the transmit power, hence enhancing users' spectral efficiency (SE) effectively.;cs.IT
1801.00149;Inverse Exponential Decay: Stochastic Fixed Point Equation and ARMA Models;We study solutions to the stochastic fixed point equation $X\stackrel{d}{=}AX+B$ when the coefficients are nonnegative and $B$ is an "inverse exponential decay" (IED) random variable. We provide theorems on the left tail of $X$ which complement well-known tail results of Kesten and Goldie. We generalize our results to ARMA processes with nonnegative coefficients whose noise terms are from the IED class. We describe the lower envelope for these ARMA processes.;math.PR
1801.00150;On a scenario of onset of strongly dissipative mixed dynamics;In this paper we present the scenario of the occurrence of strongly dissipative mixed dynamics in two-dimensional reversible diffeomorphisms, using as an example the system describing a motion of two point vortices under the influence of wave perturbation and shear flow. For mixed dynamics of this type the chaotic attractor intersects with the chaotic repeller, but their intersection forms a "thin" set. The main stage of this scenario is the appearance of homoclinic structures for a symmetric saddle orbit which arise after crisis of a homoclinic attractor and repeller.;math.DS
1801.00151;Monads on projective varieties;We generalise Fl\o{}ystad's theorem on the existence of monads on the projective space to a larger set of projective varieties. We consider a variety $X$, a line bundle $L$ on $X$, and a base-point-free linear system of sections of $L$ giving a morphism to the projective space whose image is either arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay (ACM), or linearly normal and not contained in a quadric. We give necessary and sufficient conditions on integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ for a monad of type \[ 0\to(L^\vee)^a\to\mathcal{O}_{X}^{\,b}\to L^c\to0 \] to exist. We show that under certain conditions there exists a monad whose cohomology sheaf is simple. We furthermore characterise low-rank vector bundles that are the cohomology sheaf of some monad as above. <br />Finally, we obtain an irreducible family of monads over the projective space and make a description on how the same method could be used on an ACM smooth projective variety $X$. We establish the existence of a coarse moduli space of low-rank vector bundles over an odd-dimensional $X$ and show that in one case this moduli space is irreducible.;math.AG

1801.00156;Higher topological Hochschild homology of periodic complex K-theory;We describe the topological Hochschild homology of the periodic complex $K$-theory spectrum, $THH(KU)$, as a commutative $KU$-algebra: it is equivalent to $KU[K(\mathbb{Z},3)]$ and to $F(\Sigma KU_{\mathbb{Q}})$, where $F$ is the free commutative $KU$-algebra functor on a $KU$-module. Moreover, $F(\Sigma KU_{\mathbb{Q}})\simeq KU \vee \Sigma KU_{\mathbb{Q}}$, a square-zero extension. In order to prove these results, we first establish that topological Hochschild homology commutes, as an algebra, with localization at an element. <br />Then, we prove that $THH^n(KU)$, the $n$-fold iteration of $THH(KU)$, i.e. $T^n\otimes KU$, is equivalent to $KU[G]$ where $G$ is a certain product of integral Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces, and to a free commutative $KU$-algebra on a rational $KU$-module. We prove that $S^n \otimes KU$ is equivalent to $KU[K(\mathbb{Z},n+2)]$ and to $F(\Sigma^n KU_{\mathbb{Q}})$. We describe the topological Andr\'e-Quillen homology of $KU$.;math.AT
1801.00157;On the uniqueness of solutions to quadratic BSDEs with non-convex generators;In this paper we prove some uniqueness results for quadratic backward stochastic differential equations without any convexity assumptions on the generator. The bounded case is revisited while some new results are obtained in the unbounded case when the terminal condition and the generator depend on the path of a forward stochastic differential equation. Some of these results are based on strong estimates on $Z$ that are interesting on their own and could be applied in other situations.;math.PR
1801.00158;Symmetry breaking for representations of rank one orthogonal groups II;For a pair $(G,G')=(O(n+1,1), O(n,1))$ of reductive groups, we investigate intertwining operators (symmetry breaking operators) between principal series representations $I_\delta(V,\lambda)$ of $G$, and $J_\epsilon(W,\nu)$ of the subgroup $G'$. The representations are parametrized by finite-dimensional representations $V,W$ of $O(n)$ respectively of $O(n-1)$, characters $\delta$, $\varepsilon$ of O(1), and $\lambda, \nu \in C$. <br />The multiplicty [V:W] of W occurring in the restriction $V|_{O(n-1)}$ is either 0 or 1. If $[V:W] \ne 0$ then we construct a holomorphic family of symmetry breaking operators and prove that dim $Hom_{G'}(I_{\delta}(V, \lambda)|_{G'}, J_{\epsilon}(W, \nu))$ is nonzero for all the parameters $\lambda$, $\nu$ and $\delta$, $\epsilon$, whereas if [V:W] = 0 there may exist sporadic differential symmetry breaking operators. <br />We propose a "classification scheme" to find all matrix-valued symmetry breaking operators explicitly,and carry out this program completely when V and W are exterior tensor representations. In conformal geometry, our results yield the complete classification of conformal covariant operators from differential forms on a Riemannian manifold X to those on a submanifold Y in the model space $(X, Y) = (S^n, S^{n-1})$. <br />We use these results to determine symmetry breaking operators for any pair of irreducible representations of G and the subgroup $G'$ with trivial infinitesimal character. Furthermore we prove the multiplicity conjecture by Gross and Prasad for tempered principal series representations of $(SO(n+1,1),SO(n,1))$ and also for 3 tempered representations $\Pi, \pi, \varpi$ of $SO(2m+2,1)$, $SO(2m+1,1)$ and $SO(2m,1)$ with trivial infinitesimal character. In connection to automorphic form theory, we apply our main results to find "periods" of irreducible representations of the Lorentz group having nonzero (g, K)-cohomologies.;math.RT
1801.00163;On the cone of $f$-vectors of cubical polytopes;What is the minimal closed cone containing all $f$-vectors of cubical $d$-polytopes? We construct cubical polytopes showing that this cone, expressed in the cubical $g$-vector coordinates, contains the nonnegative $g$-orthant, thus verifying one direction of the Cubical Generalized Lower Bound Conjecture of Babson, Billera and Chan. Our polytopes also show that a natural cubical analogue of the simplicial Generalized Lower Bound Theorem does not hold.;math.CO
1801.00167;A Concentration Inequality for Random Polytopes, Dirichlet-Voronoi Tiling Numbers and the Geometric Balls and Bins Problem;Our main contribution is a concentration inequality for the symmetric volume difference of a $ C^2 $ convex body with positive Gaussian curvature and a circumscribed random polytope with a restricted number of facets, for any probability measure on the boundary with a positive density function. We also show that the Dirichlet-Voronoi tiling numbers satisfy $ \text{div}_{n-1} = (2\pi e)^{-1}(n+\ln n) + O(1)$, which improves a classical result of Zador by a factor of $o(n)$. In addition, we provide a remarkable open problem which is the natural geometric generalization of the famous and fundamental "balls and bins" problem from probability. This problem is tightly connected to the optimality of random polytopes in high dimensions.;math.MG
1801.00170;Robust affine control of linear stochastic systems;In this work we provide a computationally tractable procedure for designing affine control policies, applied to constrained, discrete-time, partially observable, linear systems subject to set bounded disturbances, stochastic noise and potentially Markovian switching over a finite horizon. <br />We investigate the situation when performance specifications are expressed via averaged quadratic inequalities on the random state-control trajectory. Our methodology also applies to steering the density of the state-control trajectory under set bounded uncertainty. Our developments are based on expanding the notion of affine policies that are functions of the so-called "purified outputs", to the class of Markov jump linear systems. This re-parametrization of the set of policies, induces a bi-affine structure in the state and control variables that can further be exploited via robust optimization techniques, with the approximate inhomogeneous $S$-lemma being the cornerstone. Tractability is understood in the sense that for each type of performance specification considered, an explicit convex program for selecting the parameters specifying the control policy is provided. <br />Our contributions to the existing literature on the subject of robust constrained control lies in the fact that we are addressing a wider class of systems than the ones already studied, by including Markovian switching, and the consideration of quadratic inequalities rather than just linear ones. Our work expands on the previous investigations on finite horizon covariance control by addressing the robustness issue and the possibility that the full state may not be available, therefore enabling the steering of the state-control trajectory density in the presence of disturbances under partial observation.;math.OC
1801.00172;The Allocation of a Variable Series Reactor Considering AC Constraints and Contingencies;The Variable Series Reactors (VSRs) can efficiently control the power flow through the adjustment of the line reactance. When they are appropriately allocated in the power network, the transmission congestion and generation cost can be reduced. This paper proposes a planning model to optimally allocate VSRs considering AC constraints and multi-scenarios including base case and contingencies. The planning model is originally a non-convex large scale mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is generally intractable. The proposed Benders approach decomposes the MINLP model into a mixed integer linear program (MILP) master problem and a number of nonlinear subproblems. Numerical case studies based on IEEE 118-bus demonstrate the high performance of the proposed approach.;math.OC
1801.00177;Conservation of energy for the Euler-Korteweg equations;In this article we study the principle of energy conservation for the Euler-Korteweg system. We formulate an Onsager-type sufficient regularity condition for weak solutions of the Euler-Korteweg system to conserve the total energy. The result applies to the system of Quantum Hydrodynamics.;math.AP
1801.00179;n-Arc Connected Graphs;Given a graph G, of arbitrary size and unbounded vertex degree, denote by |G| the one-complex associated with $G$. The topological space |G| is n-arc connected (n-ac) if every set of no more than n points of |G| are contained in an arc (a homeomorphic copy of the closed unit interval). <br />For any graph G, we show the following are equivalent: (i) |G| in 7-ac, (ii) |G| is n-ac for all n, and (iii) G is a subdivision of one of nine graphs. A graph G has |G| 6-ac if and only if either G is one of the nine 7-ac graphs, or, after suppressing all degree-2-vertices, the graph G is 3-regular, 3-connected, and removing any 6 edges does not disconnect G into 4 or more components. <br />Similar combinatorial characterizations of graphs G such that |G| is n-ac for n=3, 4 and 5 are given. Together these results yield a complete classification of n-ac graphs, for all n.;math.CO
1801.00186;Norm Estimates for $k$-Plane Transforms and Geometric Inequalities;The article is devoted to remarkable interrelation between the norm estimates for $k$-plane transforms in weighted and unweighted $L^p$ spaces and geometric integral inequalities for cross-sections of measurable sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We also consider more general $j$-plane to $k$-plane transforms on affine Grassmannians and their compact modifications. The article contains a series of new integral-geometric inequalities with sharp constants, explicit equalities, conjectures, and open problems.;math.MG
1801.00188;Coefficients of Gaussian Polynomials Modulo $N$;The $q$-analogue of the binomial coefficient, known as a $q$-binomial coefficient, is typically denoted $\left[{n \atop k}\right]_q$. These polynomials are important combinatorial objects, often appearing in generating functions related to permutations and in representation theory. Stanley conjectured that the function $f_{k,R}(n) = \#\left\{i : [q^{i}] \left[{n \atop k}\right]_q \equiv R \pmod{N}\right\}$ is quasipolynomial for $N=2$. We generalize, showing that this is in fact true for any integer $N\in \mathbb{N}$ and determine a quasi-period $\pi'_N(k)$ derived from the minimal period $\pi_N(k)$ of partitions with at most $k$ parts modulo $N$.;math.CO
1801.00191;Categorical diagonalization of full twists;We conjecture that the complex of Soergel bimodules associated with the full twist braid is categorically diagonalizable, for any finite Coxeter group. This utilizes the theory of categorical diagonalization introduced earlier by the authors. We prove our conjecture in type $A$, and as a result we obtain a categorification of the Young idempotents.;math.RT
1801.00193;Free resolutions of orbit closures of Dynkin quivers;We use the Kempf-Lascoux-Weyman geometric technique in order to determine the minimal free resolutions of some orbit closures of quivers. As a consequence, we obtain that for Dynkin quivers orbit closures of 1-step representations are normal with rational singularities. For Dynkin quivers of type $A$, we describe explicit minimal generators of the defining ideals of orbit closures of 1-step representations. Using this, we provide an algorithm for type $A$ quivers for describing an efficient set of generators of the defining ideal of the orbit closure of any representation.;math.AG
1801.00195;Mittag-Leffler function and fractional differential equations;We adopt a procedure of operational-umbral type to solve the $(1+1)$-dimensional fractional Fokker-Planck equation in which time fractional derivative of order $\alpha$ ($0 &lt, \alpha &lt, 1$) is in the Riemann-Liouville sense. The technique we propose merges well documented operational methods to solve ordinary FP equation and a redefinition of the time by means of an umbral operator. We show that the proposed method allows significant progress including the handling of operator ordering.;math-ph
1801.00197;A Priori Error Estimates for Finite Element Approximations to Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami Operator;Elliptic partial differential equations on surfaces play an essential role in geometry, relativity theory, phase transitions, materials science, image processing, and other applications. They are typically governed by the Laplace-Beltrami operator. We present and analyze approximations by Surface Finite Element Methods (SFEM) of the Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalue problem. As for SFEM for source problems, spectral approximation is challenged by two sources of errors: the geometric consistency error due to the approximation of the surface and the Galerkin error corresponding to finite element resolution of eigenfunctions. We show that these two error sources interact for eigenfunction approximations as for the source problem. The situation is different for eigenvalues, where a novel situation occurs for the geometric consistency error: The degree of the geometric error depends on the choice of interpolation points used to construct the approximate surface. Thus the geometric consistency term can sometimes be made to converge faster than in the eigenfunction case through a judicious choice of interpolation points.;math.NA
1801.00199;Existence and concentration results for some fractional Schr&#xf6,dinger equations in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ with magnetic fields;We consider some nonlinear fractional Schr\"odinger equations with magnetic field and involving continuous nonlinearities having subcritical, critical or supercritical growth. Under a local condition on the potential, we use minimax methods to investigate the existence and concentration of nontrivial weak solutions.;math.AP
1801.00200;Decomposition matrices for the generic Hecke algebras on 3 strands in characteristic 0;We classify all the decomposition matrices of the generic Hecke algebras on 3 strands in characteristic 0. These are the generic Hecke algebras associated to the exceptional complex reflection groups $G_4$, $G_8$ and $G_{16}$. We prove that for every choice of the parameters that define these algebras, all ordinary representations are obtained as modular reductions of irreducible representations.;math.RT
1801.00204;Filled Julia set of some class of H&#xe9,non-like map;In this work we consider a class of endomorphisms of $\mathbb{R}^2$ defined by $f(x,y)=(xy+c,x)$, where $c\in\mathbb{R}$ is a real number and we prove that when $-1&lt,c&lt,0$, the forward filled Julia set of $f$ is the union of stable manifolds of fixed and $3-$periodic points of $f$. We also prove that the backward filled Julia set of $f$ is the union of unstable manifolds of the saddle fixed and $3-$periodic points of $f$.;math.DS
1801.00207;The $Z$-Dirac and massive Laplacian operators in the $Z$-invariant Ising model;Consider an elliptic parameter $k$, we introduce a family of $Z^u$-Dirac operators $(\mathsf{K}(u))_{u\in\Re(\mathbb{T}(k))}$, relate them to the $Z$-massive Laplacian of [BdTR17b], and extend to the full $Z$-invariant case the results of Kenyon [Ken02] on discrete holomorphic and harmonic functions, which correspond to the case $k=0$. We prove, in a direct statistical mechanics way, how and why the $Z^u$-Dirac and $Z$-massive Laplacian operators appear in the $Z$-invariant Ising model, considering the case of infinite and finite isoradial graphs. More precisely, consider the dimer model on the Fisher graph ${\mathsf{G}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathrm{F}}}$ arising from a $Z$-invariant Ising model. We express coefficients of the inverse Fisher Kasteleyn operator as a function of the inverse $Z^u$-Dirac operator and also as a function of the $Z$-massive Green function, in particular this proves a (massive) random walk representation of important observables of the Ising model. We prove that the squared partition function of the Ising model is equal, up to a constant, to the determinant of the $Z$-massive Laplacian operator with specific boundary conditions, the latter being the partition function of rooted spanning forests. To show these results, we relate the inverse Fisher Kasteleyn operator and that of the dimer model on the bipartite graph ${\mathsf{G}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathrm{Q}}}$ arising from the XOR-Ising model, and we prove matrix identities between the Kasteleyn matrix of ${\mathsf{G}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathrm{Q}}}$ and the $Z^u$-Dirac operator, that allow to reach inverse matrices as well as determinants.;math-ph
1801.00208;KP theory, plabic networks in the disk and rational degenerations of M--curves;We complete the program of Ref. [3,5] of connecting totally non-negative Grassmannians to the reality problem in KP finite-gap theory via the assignment of real regular divisors on rational degenerations of M-curves for the class of real regular multi-line soliton solutions of KP II equation whose asymptotic behavior has been combinatorially characterized by Chakravarthy, Kodama and Williams. We use the plabic networks in the disk introduced by Postnikov to parametrize positroid cells in totally nonnegative Grassmannians. The boundary of the disk corresponds to the rational curve associated to the soliton data in the direct spectral problem, and the bicolored graph is the dual of a reducible curve G which is the rational degeneration of a regular M-curve whose genus g equals the number of faces of the network diminished by one. We assign systems of edge vectors to the planar bicolored networks. The system of relations satisfied by them has maximal rank and may be reformulated in the form of edge signatures.. We prove that the components of the edge vectors are rational in the edge weights with subtraction free denominators and provide their explicit expressions in terms of conservative and edge flows. The edge vectors rule the value of the KP wave function at the double points of G, whereas the signatures at the vertices rule the position of the divisor in the ovals. We prove that the divisor satisfies the conditions of Dubrovin-Natanzon for real finite-gap solutions: there is exactly one divisor point in each oval except for the one containing the essential singularity of the wave function. The divisor may be explicitly computed using the linear relations at the vertices of the network. We explain the role of moves and reductions in the transformation of both the curve and the divisor for given soliton data, and apply our construction to some examples.;math-ph
1801.00210;A study of elliptic gamma function and allies;We study analytic and arithmetic properties of the elliptic gamma function $$ \prod_{m,n=0}^\infty\frac{1-x^{-1}q^{m+1}p^{n+1}}{1-xq^mp^n}, \qquad |q|,|p|&lt,1, $$ in the regime $p=q$, in particular, its connection with the elliptic dilogarithm and a formula of S. Bloch. We further extend the results to more general products by linking them to non-holomorphic Eistenstein series and, via some formulae of D. Zagier, to elliptic polylogarithms.;math.NT
1801.00212;Benford&#x27,s Law Beyond Independence: Tracking Benford Behavior in Copula Models;Benford's law describes a common phenomenon among many naturally occurring data sets and distributions in which the leading digits of the data are distributed with the probability of a first digit of $d$ base $B$ being $\log_{B}{\frac{d+1}{d}}$. As it often successfully detects fraud in medical trials, voting, science and finance, significant effort has been made to understand when and how distributions exhibit Benford behavior. Most of the previous work has been restricted to cases of independent variables, and little is known about situations involving dependence. We use copulas to investigate the Benford behavior of the product of $n$ dependent random variables. We develop a method for approximating the Benford behavior of a product of $n$ dependent random variables modeled by a copula distribution $C$ and quantify and bound a copula distribution's distance from Benford behavior. We then investigate the Benford behavior of various copulas under varying dependence parameters and number of marginals. Our investigations show that the convergence to Benford behavior seen with independent random variables as the number of variables in the product increases is not necessarily preserved when the variables are dependent and modeled by a copula. Furthermore, there is strong indication that the preservation of Benford behavior of the product of dependent random variables may be linked more to the structure of the copula than to the Benford behavior of the marginal distributions.;math.PR
1801.00214;Partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms homotopic to the identity on 3-manifolds;We announce some results towards the classification of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms on 3-manifolds, and outline the proofs in the case when the diffeomorphism is dynamically coherent. Detailed proofs are long and technical and will appear later.;math.DS
1801.00219;Liftings of pseudo-reflection groups of toric quotients of Krull schemes;Let $G$ be an affine algebraic group with a reductive identity component $G^{0}$ acting regularly on an affine Krull scheme $X = {Spec} (R)$ over an algebraically closed field. Let $T$ be an algebraic subtorus of $G$ and suppose that ${Q}(R)^{T}= {Q}(R^{T})$ of quotient fields. We will show: If $G$ is the centralizer of $T$ in $G$, then the pseudo-reflections of the action of $G$ on $R^{T}$ can be lifted to those on $R$.;math.GR
1801.00222;Limitation of SDMA in Ultra-Dense Small Cell Networks;Benefitting from multi-user gain brought by multi-antenna techniques, space division multiple access (SDMA) is capable of significantly enhancing spatial throughput (ST) in wireless networks. Nevertheless, we show in this letter that, even when SDMA is applied, ST would diminish to be zero in ultra-dense networks (UDN), where small cell base stations (BSs) are fully densified. More importantly, we compare the performance of SDMA, single-user beamforming (SU-BF) (one user is served in each cell) and full SDMA (the number of served users equals the number of equipped antennas). Surprisingly, it is shown that SU-BF achieves the highest ST and critical density, beyond which ST starts to degrade, in UDN. The results in this work could shed light on the fundamental limitation of SDMA in UDN.;cs.IT

1801.00226;Quantifier elimination on some pseudo-algebraically closed valued fields;Adjoining to the language of rings the function symbols for splitting coefficients, the function symbols for relative $p$-coordinate functions, and the division predicate for a valuation, some theories of pseudo-algebraically closed non-trivially valued fields admit quantifier elimination. It is also shown that in the same language the theory of pseudo-algebraically closed non-trivially valued fields of a given exponent of imperfection does not admit quantifier elimination, due to Galois theoretic obstructions.;math.LO
1801.00229;On counting certain abelian varieties over finite fields;This paper contains two parts toward studying abelian varieties from the classification point of view. In a series of papers, the current authors and T.-C. Yang obtain explicit formulas for the numbers of superspecial abelian surfaces over finite fields. In this paper, we give an explicit formula for the size of the isogeny class of simple abelian surfaces with real Weil number $\sqrt{q}$. This establishes a key step that one may extend our previous explicit calculations of superspecial abelian surfaces to those of supersingular abelian surfaces.The second part is to introduce the notion of genera and ideal complexes of abelian varieties with additional structures in a general setting. The purpose is to generalize the results of Yu on abelian varieties with additional structures to similitude classes, which establishes more results on the connection between geometrically defined and arithmetically defined masses for further investigation.;math.NT
1801.00230;Idempotents in Tangle Categories Split;In this paper we use 3-manifold techniques to illuminate the structure of the category of tangles.

1801.00231;Mean-Square Approximation of Iterated Ito and Stratonovich Stochastic Integrals of Multiplicities 1 to 6 from the Taylor-Ito and Taylor-Stratonovich Expansions Using Legendre Polynomials;The article is devoted to the practical material on expansions and mean-square approximations of specific iterated Ito and Stratonovich stochastic integrals of multiplicities 1 to 6 with respect to components of the multidimensional Wiener process on the base of the method of generalized multiple Fourier series. More precisely, we used the multiple Fourier--Legendre series converging in the sense of norm in the space $L_2([t, T]^k)$ $(k=1,\ldots,6)$ for approximation of iterated Ito and Stratonovich stochastic integrals. The considered iterated Ito and Stratonovich stochastic integrals are part of the stochastic Taylor expansions (Taylor-Ito and Taylor-Stratonovich expansions). Therefore, the results of the article can be useful for construction of the high-order strong numerical methods for Ito stochastic differential equations. Expansions of iterated Ito and Stratonovich stochastic integrals of multiplicities 1 to 6 using Legendre polynomials are derived. The convergence with probability 1 of the mentioned method of generalized multiple Fourier series is proved for iterated Ito stochastic integrals of multiplicities $k$ $(k\in\mathbb{N})$ for the cases of multiple Fourier-Legendre series and multiple trigonometric Fourier series.;math.PR
1801.00232;Stabilization of the weakly coupled wave-plate system with one internal damping;This paper is addressed to a stabilization problem of a system coupled by a wave and a Euler-Bernoulli plate equation. Only one equation is supposed to be damped. Under some assumption about the damping and the coupling terms, it is shown that sufficiently smooth solutions of the system decay logarithmically at infinity without any geometric conditions on the effective damping domain. The proofs of these decay results rely on the interpolation inequalities for the coupled elliptic-parabolic systems and make use of the estimate of the resolvent operator for the coupled system. The main tools to derive the desired interpolation inequalities are global Carleman estimates.;math.OC
1801.00234;Unstable modes in projection-based reduced-order models: How many can there be, and what do they tell you?;Projection methods provide an appealing way to construct reduced-order models of large-scale linear dynamical systems: they are intuitively motivated and fairly easy to compute. Unfortunately, the resulting reduced models need not inherit the stability of the original system. How many unstable modes can these reduced models have? This note investigates this question, using theory originally motivated by iterative methods for linear algebraic systems and eigenvalue problems, and illustrating the theory with a number of small examples. From these results follow rigorous upper bounds on the number of unstable modes in reduced models generated via orthogonal projection, for both continuous- and discrete-time systems. Can anything be learned from the unstable modes in reduced-order models? Several examples illustrate how such instability can helpfully signal transient growth in the original system.;math.NA
1801.00236;On closed subalgebras of CB(X);For a completely regular space $X$ and a non-vanishing self-adjoint closed subalgebra $H$ of $C_B(X)$ which separates points from closed sets in $X$ we construct the Gelfand spectrum $\mathfrak{sp}(H)$ of $H$ as an open subspace of the compactification of $X$ generated by $H$. The simple construction of $\mathfrak{sp}(H)$ enables easier examination of its properties. We illustrate this by an example showing that the space $\mathfrak{sp}(H)$ is separable metrizable if and only if $H$ is countably generated.;math.FA
1801.00238;Cardinal characteristics of the continuum and partitions;We prove combinatorial theorems concerning the stick principle and cardinal characteristics.;math.LO
1801.00239;The first omitting cardinal for Magidority;We prove that $\alpha_M(\lambda)$ can be successor of a supercompact cardinal, when $\lambda$ is a Magidor cardinal. From this result we obtain the consistency of $\alpha_M(\lambda)$ being a successor of a singular cardinal with uncountable cofinality.;math.LO
1801.00240;Uniform modular lattices and affine buildings;In this paper, we present a simple lattice-theoretic characterization for affine buildings of type A. We introduce a class of modular lattices, called uniform modular lattices, and show that uniform modular lattices and affine buildings of type A constitute the same object. This is an affine counterpart of the well-known equivalence between projective geometries ($\simeq$ complemented modular lattices) and spherical buildings of type A.;math.CO
1801.00241;Isometric Embedding and Darboux Integrability;Given a smooth 2-dimensional Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifold $(M, \boldsymbol{g})$ and an ambient 3-dimensional Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifold $(N, \boldsymbol{h})$, one can ask under what circumstances does the exterior differential system $\mathcal{I}$ for the isometric embedding $M\hookrightarrow N$ have particularly nice solvability properties. In this paper we give a classification of all $2$-metrics $\boldsymbol{g}$ whose local isometric embedding system into flat Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian 3-manifolds $(N, \boldsymbol{h})$ is Darboux integrable. As an illustration of the motivation behind the classification, we examine in detail one of the classified metrics, $\boldsymbol{g}_0$, showing how to use its Darboux integrability in order to construct all its embeddings in finite terms of arbitrary functions. Additionally, the geometric Cauchy problem for the embedding of $\boldsymbol{g}_0$ is shown to be reducible to a system of two first-order ODEs for two unknown functions---or equivalently, to a single second-order scalar ODE. For a large class of initial data, this reduction permits explicit solvability of the geometric Cauchy problem for $\boldsymbol{g}_0$ up to quadrature. The results described for $\boldsymbol{g}_0$ also hold for any classified metric whose embedding system is hyperbolic.;math.DG
1801.00242;Estimating symplectic capacities from lengths of closed curves on the unit spheres;We improve the estimates for the Ekeland--Hofer--Zehnder capacity of convex bodies by Gluskin and Ostrover. In the course of our argument we show that a closed characteristic of minimal action on the boundary of a centrally symmetric convex body in $\mathbb R^{2n}$ must itself be centrally symmetric, with generalizations to some other types of symmetry.;math.MG
1801.00245;On R-matrix valued Lax pairs for Calogero-Moser models;The article is devoted to the study of $R$-matrix-valued Lax pairs for $N$-body (elliptic) Calogero-Moser models. Their matrix elements are given by quantum ${\rm GL}_{\tilde N}$ $R$-matrices of Baxter-Belavin type. For $\tilde N=1$ the widely known Krichever's Lax pair with spectral parameter is reproduced. First, we construct the $R$-matrix-valued Lax pairs for Calogero-Moser models associated with classical root systems. For this purpose we study generalizations of the D'Hoker-Phong Lax pairs. It appeared that in the $R$-matrix-valued case the Lax pairs exist in special cases only. The number of quantum spaces (on which $R$-matrices act) and their dimension depend on the values of coupling constants. Some of the obtained classical Lax pairs admit straightforward extension to the quantum case. In the end we describe a relationship of the $R$-matrix-valued Lax pairs to Hitchin systems defined on ${\rm SL}_{N\tilde N}$ bundles with nontrivial characteristic classes over elliptic curve. We show that the classical analogue of the anisotropic spin exchange operator entering the $R$-matrix-valued Lax equations is reproduced in these models.;math-ph
1801.00246;A GPU Accelerated Discontinuous Galerkin Incompressible Flow Solver;We present a GPU-accelerated version of a high-order discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The equations are discretized in time using a semi-implicit scheme with explicit treatment of the nonlinear term and implicit treatment of the split Stokes operators. The pressure system is solved with a conjugate gradient method together with a fully GPU-accelerated multigrid preconditioner which is designed to minimize memory requirements and to increase overall performance. A semi-Lagrangian subcycling advection algorithm is used to shift the computational load per timestep away from the pressure Poisson solve by allowing larger timestep sizes in exchange for an increased number of advection steps. Numerical results confirm we achieve the design order accuracy in time and space. We optimize the performance of the most time-consuming kernels by tuning the fine-grain parallelism, memory utilization, and maximizing bandwidth. To assess overall performance we present an empirically calibrated roofline performance model for a target GPU to explain the achieved efficiency. We demonstrate that, in the most cases, the kernels used in the solver are close to their empirically predicted roofline performance.;math.NA
1801.00247;Spin Structures and Branch Divisors on $p$-gonal Riemann surfaces;We study spin structures on Riemann and Klein surfaces in terms of divisors. In particular, we take a closer look at spin structures on hyperelliptic and $p$-gonal surfaces defined by divisors supported on their branch points. Moreover, we study invariant spin divisors under automorphisms and anti-holomorphic involutions of Riemann surfaces.;math.CV
1801.00249;Tiling enumeration of doubly-intruded halved hexagons;Inspired by Propp's intruded Aztec diamond regions, we consider halved hexagons in which two aligned arrays of triangular holes have been removed from their boundaries. Unlike the intruded Aztec diamonds (whose numbers of domino tilings contain some large prime factors in their factorizations), the numbers of lozenge tilings of our doubly-intruded halved hexagons are given by simple product formulas in which all factors are linear in the parameters. In this paper, we present an extensive list of exact tiling enumerations of sixteen different types of doubly-intruded halved hexagons. We also prove that the lozenge tilings of a symmetric hexagon with three arrays of triangles removed are always enumerated by a closed-form product formula. Our results generalize several previous works, including Proctor's enumeration of the transposed-complementary plane partitions, related work of Ciucu, and recent generalizations of Rohatgi and of the author.;math.CO
1801.00258;Distributed Observers Design for Leader-Following Control of Multi-Agent Networks (Extended Version);This paper is concerned with a leader-follower problem for a multi-agent system with a switching interconnection topology. Distributed observers are designed for the second-order follower-agents, under the common assumption that the velocity of the active leader cannot be measured in real time. Some dynamic neighbor-based rules, consisting of distributed controllers and observers for the autonomous agents, are developed to keep updating the information of the leader. With the help of an explicitly constructed common Lyapunov function (CLF), it is proved that each agent can follow the active leader. Moreover, the tracking error is estimated even in a noisy environment. Finally, a numerical example is given for illustration.;math.OC
1801.00261;First-Order Primal-Dual Method for Nonlinear Convex Cone Programming;Nonlinear Convex Cone Programming (NCCP) problems are important and have many practical applications. In this paper, we introduces a flexible first-order primal-dual algorithm called the Variant Auxiliary Problem Principle (VAPP) for solving NCCP problems when the objective function and constraints are smooth and may be nonsmooth. Each iteration of VAPP generates a nonlinear approximation to the primal problem of an augmented Lagrangian method. The approximation incorporates both linearization and a variable distance-like function, and then the iterations of VAPP provide one decomposition property for NCCP. Motivated by recent applications in big data analysis, there has been an explosive growth in interest in the convergence rate analysis of parallel computing algorithms for large scale optimization problem. This paper proposes an iteration-based error bound and linear convergence of VAPP. Some verifiable sufficient conditions of this error bound are also discussed. For the general convex case (without error bound), we establish $O(1/t)$ convergence rate for primal suboptimality, feasibility and dual suboptimality. By adaptively setting in parameters at different iterations, we show an $O(1/t^2)$ rate for the strongly convex case. We further present Forward-Backward Splitting (FBS) formulation of VAPP method and establish the connection between VAPP and other primal-dual splitting methods. Finally, we discuss some issues in the implementation of VAPP.;math.OC
1801.00265;Semisimple characters for inner forms II: Quaternionic inner forms of classical groups;In this article we consider a quaternionic inner form $G$ of a $p$-adic classical group defined over a non-archimedian local field of odd residue characteristic. We construct all full self-dual semisimple characters for $G$ and we classify their intertwining classes using endo-parameters. Further we prove an intertwining and conjugacy theorem for self-dual semisimple characters. We give the formulas for the set of intertwiners between self-dual semisimple characters. We count all $G$-intertwining classes of self-dual semisimple characters which lift to the same $\tilde{G}$-intertwining class of a semisimple character for the ambient general linear group $\tilde{G}$ for $G$.;math.RT
1801.00267;On hereditarily just infinite profinite groups with complete Hausdorff dimension spectrum;We prove that the inverse limit of certain iterated wreath products in product action have complete Hausdorff dimension spectrum with respect to their unique maximal filtration of open normal subgroups. Moreover we can produce explicitly subgroups with a specified Hausdorff dimension.;math.GR
1801.00268;On the Quantum-Mechanics of a Single Photon;It is shown that a Dirac(-type) equation for a rank-two bi-spinor field on Minkowski (configuration) spacetime furnishes a Lorentz-covariant quantum-mechanical wave equation in position-space representation for a single free photon. This equation does not encounter any of the roadblocks that have obstructed previous attempts (by various authors) to formulate a {quantum-mechanical} photon wave equation. In particular, it implies that the photon wave function yields conserved non-negative Born-rule-type quantum probabilities, and that its probability current density four-vector transforms properly under Lorentz transformations. Moreover, the eigenvalues of the pertinent photon Dirac Hamiltonian and the vector eigenvalues of the photon momentum operator yield the familiar Einstein relations $E=\hbar\omega$ and ${\bf p}=\hbar{\bf k}$, respectively. Furthermore, these spin-1 wave modes are automatically transversal without the need of an additional constraint on the initial data. Some comments on other proposals to set up a photon wave equation are supplied as well.;math-ph
1801.00270;A Hermite WENO reconstruction for fourth order temporal accurate schemes based on the GRP solver for hyperbolic conservation laws;This paper develops a new fifth order accurate Hermite WENO (HWENO) reconstruction method for hyperbolic conservation schemes in the framework of the two-stage fourth order accurate temporal discretization in [{\em J. Li and Z. Du, A two-stage fourth order time-accurate discretization {L}ax--{W}endroff type flow solvers, {I}. {H}yperbolic conservation laws, SIAM, J. Sci. Comput., 38 (2016), pp.~A3046--A3069}]. Instead of computing the first moment of the solution additionally in the conventional HWENO or DG approach, we can directly take the {\em interface values}, which are already available in the numerical flux construction using the generalized Riemann problem (GRP) solver, to approximate the first moment. The resulting scheme is fourth order temporal accurate by only invoking the HWENO reconstruction twice so that it becomes more compact. Numerical experiments show that such compactness makes significant impact on the resolution of nonlinear waves.;math.NA
1801.00279;Partial quasi likelihood analysis;The quasi likelihood analysis is generalized to the partial quasi likelihood analysis. Limit theorems for the quasi likelihood estimators, especially the quasi Bayesian estimator, are derived in the situation where existence of a slow mixing component prohibits the Rosenthal type inequality from applying to the derivation of the polynomial type large deviation inequality for the statistical random field. We give two illustrative examples.;math.ST
1801.00287;Cubic threefolds and hyperk&#xe4,hler manifolds uniformized by the 10-dimensional complex ball;We first prove an isomorphism between the moduli space of smooth cubic threefolds and the moduli space of hyperkaehler fourfolds of K3^{[2]}-type with a non-symplectic automorphism of order three, whose invariant lattice has rank one and is generated by a class of square 6, both these spaces are uniformized by the same 10-dimensional arithmetic complex ball quotient. We then study the degeneration of the automorphism along the loci of nodal or chordal degenerations of the cubic threefold, showing the birationality of these loci with some moduli spaces of hyperkaehler fourfolds of K3^{[2]}-type with non-symplectic automorphism of order three belonging to different families. Finally, we construct a cyclic Pfaffian cubic fourfold to give an explicit construction of a non-natural automorphism of order three on the Hilbert square of a K3 surface.;math.AG
1801.00288;Boolean Dimension, Components and Blocks;We investigate the behavior of Boolean dimension with respect to components and blocks. To put our results in context, we note that for Dushnik-Miller dimension, we have that if $\dim(C)\le d$ for every component $C$ of a poset $P$, then $\dim(P)\le \max\{2,d\}$, also if $\dim(B)\le d$ for every block $B$ of a poset $P$, then $\dim(P)\le d+2$. By way of constrast, local dimension is well behaved with respect to components, but not for blocks: if $\text{ldim}(C)\le d$ for every component $C$ of a poset $P$, then $\text{ldim}(P)\le d+2$, however, for every $d\ge 4$, there exists a poset $P$ with $\text{ldim}(P)=d$ and $\dim(B)\le 3$ for every block $B$ of $P$. In this paper we show that Boolean dimension behaves like Dushnik-Miller dimension with respect to both components and blocks: if $\text{bdim}(C)\le d$ for every component $C$ of $P$, then $\text{bdim}(P)\le 2+d+4\cdot2^d$, also if $\text{bdim}(B)\le d$ for every block of $P$, then $\text{bdim}(P)\le 19+d+18\cdot 2^d$.;math.CO
1801.00291;A generalized Bartholdi zeta function formula for simple graphs with bounded degree;We introduce a generalized Bartholdi zeta function for simple graphs with bounded degree. This zeta function is a generalization of both the Bartholdi zeta function which was introduced by L.~Bartholdi and the Ihara zeta function which was introduced by G.~Chinta, J.~Jorgenson and A.~Karlsson. Furthermore, we establish a Bartholdi type formula of this Bartholdi zeta function for simple graphs with bounded degree. Moreover, for regular graphs, we give a new expression of the heat kernel which is regarded as a one-parameter deformation of the expression obtained by G.~Chinta, J.~Jorgenson and A.~Karlsson. By applying this formula, we give an alternative proof of the Bartholdi zeta function formula for regular graphs.;math.CO
1801.00295;Moutard transform for the conductivity equation;We construct Darboux-Moutard type transforms for the two-dimensional conductivity equation. This result continues our recent studies of Darboux-Moutard type transforms for generalized analytic functions. In addition, at least, some of the Darboux-Moutard type transforms of the present work admit direct extension to the conductivity equation in multidimensions. Relations to the Schr\"odinger equation at zero energy are also shown.;math-ph
1801.00296;Graph invariants and Betti numbers of real toric manifolds;For a graph $G$, a graph cubeahedron $\square_G$ and a graph associahedron $\triangle_G$ are simple convex polytopes which admit (real) toric manifolds. In this paper, we introduce a graph invariant, called the $b$-number, and we show that the $b$-numbers compute the Betti numbers of the real toric manifold $X^\mathbb{R}(\square_G)$ corresponding to a graph cubeahedron. The $b$-number is a counterpart of the notion of $a$-number, introduced by S. Choi and the second named author, which computes the Betti numbers of the real toric manifold $X^\mathbb{R}(\triangle_G)$ corresponding to a graph associahedron. We also study various relationships between $a$-numbers and $b$-numbers from a toric topological view. Interestingly, for a forest $G$ and its line graph $L(G)$, the real toric manifolds $X^\mathbb{R}(\triangle_G)$ and $X^\mathbb{R}(\square_{L(G)})$ have the same Betti numbers.;math.CO
1801.00302;Pure-minimal chain complexes;We introduce a notion of pure-minimality for chain complexes of modules and show that it coincides with (homotopic) minimality in standard settings, while being a more useful notion for complexes of flat modules. As applications, we characterize von Neumann regular rings and left perfect rings.;math.AC
1801.00303;An elementary proof of an isoperimetric inequality for paths with finite $p$-variation;In this article we will prove that if the continuous closed curve $\gamma : [0, 1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ has finite $p$-variation with $p &lt, 2$, then $(\iint\limits_{\mathbb{R}^2}|\eta(\gamma, (x, y))|^q \,dx \,dy)^{1/q} \le (\frac{1}{2})^\frac{1}{q}(\zeta(\frac{2}{pq})-1)(||\gamma||_{p, [0, 1]})^{\frac{2}{q}} $ for all $q \in [1, \frac{2}{p})$, where $\eta(\gamma, (x, y))$ is the winding number of $\gamma$ at $(x, y), \zeta$ is the Reimann zeta function, and $||\gamma||_{p, [0, 1]}$ is the $p$-variation of $\gamma$ on the interval $[0, 1]$. <br />Our main contribution is that we have explicitly given a bound by known constants, and we have found this by an elementary proof. We are going to be using a method introduced by L.C. Young in 1936.;math.CA
1801.00310;On Binary Distributed Hypothesis Testing;We consider the problem of distributed binary hypothesis testing of two sequences that are generated by an i.i.d. doubly-binary symmetric source. Each sequence is observed by a different terminal. The two hypotheses correspond to different levels of correlation between the two source components, i.e., the crossover probability between the two. The terminals communicate with a decision function via rate-limited noiseless links. We analyze the tradeoff between the exponential decay of the two error probabilities associated with the hypothesis test and the communication rates. We first consider the side-information setting where one encoder is allowed to send the full sequence. For this setting, previous work exploits the fact that a decoding error of the source does not necessarily lead to an erroneous decision upon the hypothesis. We provide improved achievability results by carrying out a tighter analysis of the effect of binning error, the results are also more complete as they cover the full exponent tradeoff and all possible correlations. We then turn to the setting of symmetric rates for which we utilize Korner-Marton coding to generalize the results, with little degradation with respect to the performance with a one-sided constraint (side-information setting).;cs.IT
1801.00311;Igor Rostislavovich Shafarevich: in Memoriam;The prominent Russian mathematician Igor Rostislavovich Shafarevich passed away on February 19, 2017. In this article we supply his biography, discuss his many important contributions to number theory, algebra and algebraic geometry, and also discuss his political activity and some of his numerous publications on social issues.;math.HO
1801.00312;Irreducible representations of the group of unipotent matrices of order $4$ over integers;We study a coarse moduli space of irreducible representations of the group of unipotent matrices of order $\mathbb{4}$ over the ring of integers which have finite weight. All such representations are known to be monomial. To describe a coarse moduli space of such representations, we need to study pairs of subgroups and their characters, which induce non-isomorphic irreducible representations. We obtain a full classification of such pairs and, respectively, a coarse moduli space.;math.RT
1801.00314;Symmetric double bubbles in the Grushin plane;We address the double bubble problem for the anisotropic Grushin perimeter $P_\alpha$, $\alpha\geq 0$, and the Lebesgue measure in $\mathbb R^2$, in the case of two equal volumes. We assume that the contact interface between the bubbles lays on either the vertical or the horizontal axis. Since no regularity theory is available in this setting, in both cases we first prove existence of minimizers via the direct method by symmetrization arguments and then characterize them in terms of the given area by first variation techniques. Angles at which minimal boundaries intersect satisfy the standard 120-degree rule up to a suitable change of coordinates. While for $\alpha=0$ the Grushin perimeter reduces to the Euclidean one and both minimizers coincide with the symmetric double bubble found in [Foisy et al., Pacific J. Math. (1993)], for $\alpha=1$ vertical interface minimizers have Grushin perimeter strictly greater than horizontal interface minimizers. As the latter ones are obtained by translating and dilating the Grushin isoperimetric set found in [Monti Morbidelli, J. Geom. Anal. (2004)], we conjecture that they solve the double bubble problem with no assumptions on the contact interface.;math.OC
1801.00320;Immersed M&#xf6,bius bands in knot complements and representatives of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-homology classes;We study the 3-dimensional immersed crosscap number of a knot, which is a nonorientable analogue of the immersed Seifert genus. We study knots with immersed crosscap number 1, and show that a knot has immersed crosscap number 1 if and only if it is a nonntrivial $(2p,q)$-torus or $(2p,q)$-cable knot. We show that unlike in the orientable case the immersed crosscap number can differ from the embedded crosscap number by arbitrarily large amounts, and that it is neither bounded below nor above by the 4-dimensional crosscap number. We then use these constructions to find, for any $n\geq 2$, an oriented 3-manifold $Y_n$ and class $\alpha_n \in H_2(Y_n,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ such that $\alpha_n$ can be represented by an immersed $\mathbb{RP}^2$, but any embedded representative of $\alpha_n$ has a component $S$ with $\chi(S) \leq 1-n$.;math.GT
1801.00321;Modified trace is a symmetrised integral;A modified trace for a finite k-linear pivotal category is a family of linear forms on endomorphism spaces of projective objects which has cyclicity and so-called partial trace properties. We show that a non-degenerate modified trace defines a compatible with duality Calabi-Yau structure on the subcategory of projective objects. The modified trace provides a meaningful generalisation of the categorical trace to non-semisimple categories and allows to construct interesting topological invariants. We prove, that for any finite-dimensional unimodular pivotal Hopf algebra over a field k, a modified trace is determined by a symmetric linear form on the Hopf algebra constructed from an integral. More precisely, we prove that shifting with the pivotal element defines an isomorphism between the space of right integrals, which is known to be 1-dimensional, and the space of modified traces. This result allows us to compute modified traces for all simply laced restricted quantum groups at roots of unity.;math.QA
1801.00323;Geometric optics for Rayleigh wavetrains in d-dimensional nonlinear elasticity;A Rayleigh wave is a type of surface wave that propagates in the boundary of an elastic solid with traction (or Neumann) boundary conditions. Since the 1980s much work has been done on the problem of constructing a leading term in an \emph{approximate} solution to the rather complicated second-order quasilinear hyperbolic boundary value problem with fully nonlinear Neumann boundary conditions that governs the propagation of Rayleigh waves. The question has remained open whether or not this leading term approximate solution is really close in a precise sense to the exact solution of the governing equations. We prove a positive answer to this question for the case of Rayleigh wavetrains in any space dimension $d\geq 2$. The case of Rayleigh pulses in dimension $d=2$ has already been treated by Coulombel and Williams. For highly oscillatory Rayleigh wavetrains we are able to construct high-order approximate solutions consisting of the leading term plus an arbitrary number of correctors. Using those high-order solutions we then perform an error analysis which shows (among other things) that for small wavelengths the leading term is close to the exact solution in $L^\infty$ on a fixed time interval independent of the wavelength. The error analysis is carried out in a somewhat general setting and is applicable to other types of waves for which high order approximate solutions can be constructed.;math.AP
1801.00324;Blockers for Triangulations of a Convex Polygon and a Geometric Maker-Breaker Game;Let $G$ be a complete convex geometric graph whose vertex set $P$ forms a convex polygon $C$, and let $F$ be a family of subgraphs of $G$. A blocker for $F$ is a set of edges, of smallest possible size, that contains a common edge with every element of $F$. Previous works determined the blockers for various families $F$ of non-crossing subgraphs, including the families of all perfect matchings, all spanning trees, all Hamiltonian paths, etc. <br />In this paper we present a complete characterization of the family $B$ of blockers for the family $T$ of triangulations of $C$. In particular, we show that $|B|=F_{2n-8}$, where $F_k$ is the $k$'th element in the Fibonacci sequence and $n=|P|$. <br />We use our characterization to obtain a tight result on a geometric Maker-Breaker game in which the board is the set of diagonals of a convex $n$-gon $C$ and Maker seeks to occupy a triangulation of $C$. Namely, we show that in the $(1:1)$ triangulation game, Maker can ensure a win within $n-3$ moves, and that in the $(1:2)$ triangulation game, Breaker can ensure a win within $n-3$ moves. In particular, the threshold bias for the game is $2$.;math.CO
1801.00325;Sharp finiteness principles for Lipschitz selections;Let $(M,\rho)$ be a metric space and let $Y$ be a Banach space. Given a positive integer $m$, let $F$ be a set-valued mapping from $M$ into the family of all compact convex subsets of $Y$ of dimension at most $m$. In this paper we prove a finiteness principle for the existence of a Lipschitz selection of $F$ with the sharp value of the finiteness constant.;math.FA
1801.00327;Construction of the quasi-potential for linear SDEs using false quasi-potentials and a geometric recursion;The quasi-potential is a key concept of the Large Deviation Theory for Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). Once the quasi-potential with respect to an attractor of the corresponding deterministic system is found, one can readily obtain maximum likelihood exit paths and estimate the exit rate from the basin of attraction and the invariant probability density near the attractor. The quasi-potential for a linear SDE with asymptotically stable equilibrium at the origin is a quadratic form whose matrix was found by Z. Chen and M. Freidlin (2005). Their formula involves an integral of certain matrix exponentials and is inconvenient for numerical evaluation. In this work, I propose a different approach for constructing the quasi-potential matrix for linear SDEs based on a certain easy-to-obtain hierarchy of orthogonal decompositions inspired by those used by M. Tao (2018). A number of properties of these decompositions, named false quasi-potential decompositions, is established. A geometric recursive algorithm implementing this approach is presented. It involves only numerically stable sub-algorithms such as the computation of Schur decompositions and solving systems of linear equations or quadratic least squares problems. This work is motivated by the need to initialize the quasi-potential solvers near asymptotically stable equilibria. An accurate way to do it is to linearize the SDE near the equilibrium and set the values of the quasi-potential at the neighboring mesh points to the exact quasi-potential of the linearized system.;math.PR
1801.00328;Reconstruction of the Path Graph;Let $P$ be a set of $n \geq 5$ points in convex position in the plane. The path graph $G(P)$ of $P$ is an abstract graph whose vertices are non-crossing spanning paths of $P$, such that two paths are adjacent if one can be obtained from the other by deleting an edge and adding another edge. <br />We prove that the automorphism group of $G(P)$ is isomorphic to $D_{n}$, the dihedral group of order $2n$. The heart of the proof is an algorithm that first identifies the vertices of $G(P)$ that correspond to boundary paths of $P$, where the identification is unique up to an automorphism of $K(P)$ as a geometric graph, and then identifies (uniquely) all edges of each path represented by a vertex of $G(P)$. The complexity of the algorithm is $O(N \log N)$ where $N$ is the number of vertices of $G(P)$.;math.CO
1801.00331;On Operator Valued Measures;We consider positive operator valued measures whose image is the bounded operators acting on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, and we relax, when possible, the usual assumption of positivity of the operator valued measure seen in the quantum information theory literature. We define the Radon-Nikodym derivative of a positive operator valued measure with respect to a complex measure induced by a given quantum state, this derivative does not always exist when the Hilbert space is infinite dimensional in so much as its range may include unbounded operators. We define integrability of a positive quantum random variable with respect to a positive operator valued measure. Emphasis is put on the structure of operator valued measures, and we develop positive operator valued versions of the Lebesque decomposition theorem and Johnson's atomic and nonatomic decomposition theorem. Beyond these generalizations, we make connections between absolute continuity and the "cleanness" relation defined on positive operator valued measures as well as to the notion of atomic and nonatomic measures.;math.FA
1801.00333;Quickest drift change detection in L&#xe9,vy-type force of mortality model;In this paper we give solution to the quickest drift change detection problem for a L\'evy process consisting of both a continuous Gaussian part and a jump component. We consider here Bayesian framework with an exponential a priori distribution of the change point using an optimality criterion based on a probability of false alarm and an expected delay of the detection. Our approach is based on the optimal stopping theory and solving some boundary value problem. Paper is supplemented by an extensive numerical analysis related with the construction of the Generalized Shiryaev-Roberts statistics. In particular, we apply this method (after appropriate calibration) to analyse Polish life tables and to model the force of mortality in this population with a drift changing in time.;math.OC
1801.00334;Newton-Okounkov polytopes of Bott-Samelson varieties as Minkowski sums;We compute the Newton--Okounkov bodies of line bundles on a Bott--Samelson resolution of the complete flag variety of $GL_n$ for a geometric valuation coming from a flag of translated Schubert subvarieties. The Bott--Samelson resolution corresponds to the decomposition $(s_1)(s_2s_1)(s_3s_2s_1)(\ldots)(s_{n-1}\ldots s_1)$ of the longest element in the Weyl group, and the Schubert subvarieties correspond to the terminal subwords in this decomposition. We prove that the resulting Newton--Okounkov polytopes for semiample line bundles satisfy the additivity property with respect to the Minkowski sum. In particular, they are Minkowski sums of Newton--Okounkov polytopes of line bundles on the complete flag varieties for $GL_2$,\ldots, $GL_{n}$.;math.AG
1801.00335;Plato&#x27,s cave and differential forms;In the 1970s and again in the 1990s, Gromov gave a number of theorems and conjectures motivated by the notion that the real homotopy theory of compact manifolds and simplicial complexes influences the geometry of maps between them. The main technical result of this paper supports this intuition: we show that maps of differential algebras are closely shadowed, in a technical sense, by maps between the corresponding spaces. As a concrete application, we prove the following conjecture of Gromov: if $X$ and $Y$ are finite complexes with $Y$ simply connected, then there are constants $C(X,Y)$ and $p(X,Y)$ such that any two homotopic $L$-Lipschitz maps have a $C(L+1)^p$-Lipschitz homotopy (and if one of the maps is a constant, $p$ can be taken to be $2$.) We hope that it will lead more generally to a better understanding of the space of maps from $X$ to $Y$ in this setting.;math.GT
1801.00339;A Harmonic Analysis Proof of the Boundary Observability Inequality for the Wave Equation and Visco-Elastic Equation;In this paper, we give a harmonic analysis proof of the Neumann boundary observability inequality for the wave equation in an arbitrary space dimension. Our proof is elementary in nature and gives a simple, explicit constant. We also extend the method to prove the observability inequality of a visco-elastic wave equation.;math.AP
1801.00341;Breaking the curse of dimension in multi-marginal Kantorovich optimal transport on finite state spaces;We present a new ansatz space for the general symmetric multi-marginal Kantorovich optimal transport problem on finite state spaces which reduces the number of unknowns from $\tbinom{N+\ell-1}{\ell-1}$ to $\ell\cdot(N+1)$, where $\ell$ is the number of marginal states and $N$ the number of marginals. <br />The new ansatz space is a careful low-dimensional enlargement of the Monge class, which corresponds to $\ell\cdot(N-1)$ unknowns, and cures the insufficiency of the Monge ansatz, i.e. we show that the Kantorovich problem always admits a minimizer in the enlarged class, for arbitrary cost functions. <br />Our results apply, in particular, to the discretization of multi-marginal optimal transport with Coulomb cost in three dimensions, which has received much recent interest due to its emergence as the strongly correlated limit of Hohenberg-Kohn density functional theory. In this context $N$ corresponds to the number of particles, motivating the interest in large $N$.;math.AP
1801.00343;Limit points of subsequences;Let $x$ be a sequence taking values in a separable metric space and $\mathcal{I}$ be a generalized density ideal or an $F_\sigma$-ideal on the positive integers (in particular, $\mathcal{I}$ can be any Erd{\H o}s--Ulam ideal or any summable ideal). It is shown that the collection of subsequences of $x$ which preserve the set of $\mathcal{I}$-cluster points of $x$ [respectively, $\mathcal{I}$-limit points] is of second category if and only if the set of $\mathcal{I}$-cluster points of $x$ [resp., $\mathcal{I}$-limit points] coincides with the set of ordinary limit points of $x$, moreover, in this case, it is comeager. In particular, it follows that the collection of subsequences of $x$ which preserve the set of ordinary limit points of $x$ is comeager.;math.GN
1801.00347;Extensions of submanifold theory to non-real settings, with applications;In this thesis, we study extensions of the theory of Riemannian submanifolds in two directions. First, we will show how Riemannian geometry and submanifold theory in particular, can be generalized using the notion of 'Rinehart spaces', and it will be demonstrated how the developed framework unifies some existing and new flavours of Riemannian geometry over different ground rings. In the second part of the thesis, we give a description of holomorphic Riemannian submanifold theory where complex numbers fully replace the role of the real numbers as ground field, and show how this can be applied to reveal direct connections between the submanifolds of so-called Wick-related pseudo-Riemannian spaces.;math.DG
1801.00348;Dynamical zeta functions for Axiom A flows;We show that the Ruelle zeta function of any smooth Axiom A flow with orientable stable/unstable spaces has a meromorphic continuation to the entire complex plane. The proof uses the meromorphic continuation result of [<a href="/abs/1410.5516">arXiv:1410.5516</a>] together with the work of Conley-Easton and [<a href="/abs/1711.10059">arXiv:1711.10059</a>] which imply that every basic hyperbolic set can be put into the framework of [<a href="/abs/1410.5516">arXiv:1410.5516</a>].;math.DS
1801.00351;Isoparametric functions on $\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{M}^m$;We classify the isoparametric functions on $\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{M}^m$, $n, m\geq2$, with compact level sets, where $\mathbb{M}^m$ is a connected, closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $m$. Also, we classify the isoparametric hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{R}^2$ with constant principal curvatures.;math.DG
1801.00352;Coherence, squeezing and entanglement -- an example of peaceful coexistence;After exhaustive inspection of bosonic coherent states appearing in physical literature two of us, Horzela and Szafraniec, came in 2012 to the reasonably general definition which relies exclusively on reproducing kernels. The basic feature of coherent states, which is the resolution of the identity, is preserved though it now achieves advantageous form of the Segal-Bargmann transform. <br />It turns out that the aforesaid definition is not only extremely economical but also puts under a common umbrella typical coherent states as well as those which are squeezed and entangled. We examine the case here on the groundwork of holomorphic Hermite polynomials in one and two variables. An interesting side of this story is how some limit procedure allows disentangling.;math-ph
1801.00353;Generic pro-$p$ Hecke algebras;This is an extended and corrected version of the author's Diplomarbeit. A class of algebras called generic pro-$p$ Hecke algebras is introduced, enlarging the class of generic Hecke algebras by considering certain extensions of (extended) Coxeter groups. Examples of generic pro-$p$ Hecke algebras are given by pro-$p$-Iwahori Hecke algebras and Yokonuma-Hecke algebras. The notion of an orientation of a Coxeter group is introduced and used to define `Bernstein maps' intimately related to Bernstein's presentation and to Cherednik's cocycle. It is shown that certain relations in the Hecke algebra hold true, equivalent to Bernstein's relations in the case of Iwahori-Hecke algebras. <br />For a certain subclass called affine pro-$p$ Hecke algebras, containing Iwahori-Hecke and pro-$p$-Iwahori Hecke algebras, an explicit canonical and integral basis of the center is constructed and finiteness results are proved about the center and the module-structure of the algebra over its center, recovering results of Bernstein-Zelevinsky-Lusztig and Vign\'eras.;math.RT
1801.00355;Analytic computable structure theory and $L^p$-spaces part 2;Suppose $p \geq 1$ is a computable real. We extend previous work of Clanin, Stull, and McNicholl by classifying the computable $L^p$ spaces whose underlying measure spaces are atomic but not purely atomic. In addition, we determine the degrees of categoricity of these spaces and the complexity of associated projection maps.;math.LO
1801.00357;The global dimension of the algebra of the monoid of all partial functions on an $n$-set as the algebra of the EI-category of epimorphisms between subsets;We prove that the global dimension of the complex algebra of the monoid of all partial functions on an n-set is $n-1$ for all $n\geq 1$. This is also the global dimension of the complex algebra of the category of all epimorphisms between subsets of an $n$-set. In our proof we use standard homological methods as well as combinatorial techniques associated to the representation theory of the symmetric group. As part of the proof, we obtain a partial description of the Cartan matrix of these algebras.;math.RT
1801.00360;Geometric Perturbation Theory for a Class of Fiber Bundles;A systematic study of small, time-dependent, perturbations to geometric wave-equation domains is hardly existent. Acoustic enclosures are typical examples featuring locally reacting surfaces that respond to a pressure gradient or a pressure difference, alter the enclosure's volume and, hence, the boundary conditions, and do so locally through their vibrations. Accordingly, the Laplace-Beltrami operator in the acoustic wave equation lives in a temporally varying domain depending on the displacement of the locally reacting surface from equilibrium. The resulting partial differential equations feature nonlinearities and are coupled though the time-dependent boundary conditions. The solution to the afore-mentioned problem, as presented here, integrates techniques from differential geometry, functional analysis, and physics. The appropriate space is shown to be a (perturbation) fiber bundle. In the context of a systematic perturbation theory, the solution to the dynamical problem is obtained from a combination of semigroup techniques for operator evolution equations and metric perturbation theory as used in AdS/CFT. Duhamel's principle then yields a time-dependent perturbation theory, called geometric perturbation theory. It is analogous to, though different from, both Dirac's time-dependent perturbation theory and the Magnus expansion. Specifically, the formalism demonstrates that the stationary-domain approximation for vibrational acoustics only introduces a small error. Analytic simplifications methods are derived in the framework of the piston approximation. Globally reacting surfaces (so-called pistons) replace the formerly locally reacting surfaces and reduce the number of independent variables in the underlying partial differential equations. In this way, a straightforwardly applicable formalism is derived for scalar wave equations on time-varying domains.;math-ph
1801.00366;Szeg&#xf6, Limit Theorems for Singular Berezin-Toeplitz Operators;We consider Berezin-Toeplitz operators whose multipliers are compactly supported densities carried by a submanifold of ${\mathbb C}^N$ . We compute asymptotically the moments of their spectral measures, and we prove Szeg\"o limit theorems in cases when the submanifold is isotropic or co-isotropic, from which Weyl estimates follow. We also obtain asymptotics of the Schatten norms of such operators. Rescaled versions of these operators can be thought of as quantum mechanical mixed states, and our results give the semi-classical limit of their entropy.;math.SP
1801.00367;Examples of sharp asymptotic profiles of singular solutions to an elliptic equation with a sign-changing non-linearity;The first two authors [Proc. Lond. Math. Soc. (3) {\bf 114}(1):1--34, 2017] classified the behaviour near zero for all positive solutions of the perturbed elliptic equation with a critical Hardy--Sobolev growth <br />$$-\Delta u=|x|^{-s} u^{2^\star(s)-1} -\mu u^q \hbox{ in }B\setminus\{0\},$$ where $B$ denotes the open unit ball centred at $0$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n\geq 3$, $s\in (0,2)$, $2^\star(s):=2(n-s)/(n-2)$, $\mu&gt,0$ and $q&gt,1$. For $q\in (1,2^\star-1)$ with $2^\star=2n/(n-2)$, it was shown in the op. cit. that the positive solutions with a non-removable singularity at $0$ could exhibit up to three different singular profiles, although their existence was left open. In the present paper, we settle this question for all three singular profiles in the maximal possible range. As an important novelty for $\mu&gt,0$, we prove that for every $q\in (2^\star(s) -1,2^\star-1)$ there exist infinitely many positive solutions satisfying $|x|^{s/(q-2^\star(s)+1)}u(x)\to \mu^{-1/(q-2^\star(s)+1)}$ as $|x|\to 0$, using a dynamical system approach. Moreover, we show that there exists a positive singular solution with $\liminf_{|x|\to 0} |x|^{(n-2)/2} u(x)=0$ and <br />$\limsup_{|x|\to 0} |x|^{(n-2)/2} u(x)\in (0,\infty)$ if (and only if) $q\in (2^\star-2,2^\star-1)$.;math.AP
1801.00368;Stable rank one matrix completion is solved by two rounds of semidefinite programming relaxation;This paper studies the problem of deterministic rank-one matrix completion. It is known that the simplest semidefinite programming relaxation, involving minimization of the nuclear norm, does not in general return the solution for this problem. In this paper, we show that in every instance where the problem has a unique solution, one can provably recover the original matrix through two rounds of semidefinite programming relaxation with minimization of the trace norm. We further show that the solution of the proposed semidefinite program is Lipschitz-stable with respect to perturbations of the observed entries, unlike more basic algorithms such as nonlinear propagation or ridge regression. Our proof is based on recursively building a certificate of optimality corresponding to a dual sum-of-squares (SOS) polynomial. This SOS polynomial is built from the polynomial ideal generated by the completion constraints and the monomials provided by the minimization of the trace. The proposed relaxation fits in the framework of the Lasserre hierarchy, albeit with the key addition of the trace objective function. We further show how to represent and manipulate the moment tensor in favorable complexity by means of a hierarchical low-rank decomposition.;math.NA
1801.00370;Lie Pseudogroups &#xe0, la Cartan;We present a modern formulation of \'Elie Cartan's structure theory for Lie pseudogroups and prove a reduction theorem that clarifies the role of Cartan's systatic system. The paper is divided into three parts. In part one, using notions coming from the theory of Lie groupoids and algebroids, we introduce the framework of Cartan algebroids and realizations, structures that encode Cartan's structure equations and notion of a pseudogroup in normal form. In part two, we present a novel proof of Cartan's Second Fundamental Theorem, which states that any Lie pseudogroup is equivalent to a pseudogroup in normal form. In part three, we prove a new reduction theorem that states that, under suitable regularity conditions, a pseudogroup in normal form canonically reduces to a generalized pseudogroup of local solutions of a Lie-Pfaffian groupoid.;math.DG
1801.00375;Modular forms from Noether-Lefschetz theory;We enumerate smooth rational curves on very general Weierstrass fibrations over hypersurfaces in projective space. The generating functions for these numbers lie in the ring of classical modular forms. The method of proof uses topological intersection products on a period stack and the cohomological theta correspondence of Kudla and Millson for special cycles on a locally symmetric space of orthogonal type. The results here apply only in base degree 1, but heuristics for higher base degree match predictions from the topological string partition function.;math.AG
1801.00378;Tropical geometry of genus two curves;We exploit three classical characterizations of smooth genus two curves to study their tropical and analytic counterparts. First, we provide a combinatorial rule to determine the dual graph of each algebraic curve and the metric structure on the associated minimal Berkovich skeleton. Our main tool is the description of genus two curves via hyperelliptic covers of P^1 with six branch points. Given the valuations of these six points and their differences, our algorithm provides an explicit harmonic 2-to-1 map to a metric tree on six leaves. Second, we use tropical modifications to produce a faithful tropicalization in dimension three starting from a planar hyperelliptic embedding. <br />Finally, we consider the moduli space of abstract genus two tropical curves and translate the classical Igusa invariants characterizing isomorphism classes of genus two algebraic curves into the tropical realm. While these tropical Igusa functions do not yield coordinates in the tropical moduli space, we propose an alternative set of invariants that provides new length data.;math.AG
1801.00379;Word maps, word maps with constants and representation varieties of one-relator groups;We consider word maps and word maps with constants on a simple algebraic group. We present results on the images of such maps, in particular, we prove a theorem on the dominance of general word maps with constants, which can be viewed as an analogue of a well-known theorem of Borel on the dominance of genuine word maps. Besides, we establish a relationship between the existence of unipotents in the image of a word map and the structure of the corresponding representation variety.;math.GR
1801.00380;On Variable Ordination of Modified Cholesky Decomposition for Sparse Covariance Matrix Estimation;Estimation of large sparse covariance matrices is of great importance for statistical analysis, especially in the high-dimensional settings. The traditional approach such as the sample covariance matrix performs poorly due to the high dimensionality. The modified Cholesky decomposition (MCD) is a commonly used method for sparse covariance matrix estimation. However, the MCD method relies on the order of variables, which is often not available or cannot be pre-determined in practice. In this work, we solve this order issue by obtaining a set of covariance matrix estimates under different orders of variables used in the MCD. Then we consider an ensemble estimator as the "center" of such a set of covariance matrix estimates with respect to the Frobenius norm. The proposed method not only ensures the estimator to be positive definite, but also can capture the underlying sparse structure of the covariance matrix. Under some weak regularity conditions, we establish both algorithmic convergence and asymptotical convergence of the proposed method. The merits of the proposed method are illustrated through simulation studies and one real data example.;math.ST
1801.00381;Word maps on perfect algebraic groups;We extend Borel's theorem on the dominance of word maps from semisimple algebraic groups to some perfect groups. In another direction, we generalize Borel's theorem to some words with constants. We also consider the surjectivity problem for particular words and groups, give a brief survey of recent results, present some generalizations and variations and discuss various approaches, with emphasis on new ideas, constructions and connections.;math.GR
1801.00387;Diversity Analysis of Millimeter-Wave Massive MIMO Systems;This paper is concerned with asymptotic diversity analysis for millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive MIMO systems. First, for a single-user mmWave system employing distributed antenna subarray architecture in which the transmitter and receiver consist of Kt and Kr subarrays, respectively, a diversity gain theorem is established when the numbers of antennas at subarrays go to infinity. Specifically, assuming that all subchannels have the same number of propagation paths L, the theorem states that by employing such a distributed antenna-subarray architecture, a diversity gain of KrKtL-Ns+1 can be achieved, where Ns is the number of data streams. This result means that compared to the co-located antenna architecture, using the distributed antenna-subarray architecture can scale up the diversity gain or multiplexing gain proportionally to KrKt. The diversity gain analysis is then extended to the multiuser scenario as well as the scenario with conventional partially-connected RF structure in the literature. Simulation results obtained with the hybrid analog/digital processing corroborate the analysis results and show that the distributed subarray architecture indeed yields significantly better diversity performance than the co-located antenna architectures.;cs.IT
1801.00391;Rate of convergence in periodic homogenization of Hamilton-Jacobi equations: the convex setting;We study the rate of convergence of $u^\epsilon$, as $\epsilon \to 0+$, to $u$ in periodic homogenization of Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Here, $u^\epsilon$ and $u$ are viscosity solutions to the oscillatory Hamilton-Jacobi equation and its effective equation \begin{equation*} {\rm (C)_\epsilon} \qquad \begin{cases} u_t^\epsilon+H\left(\frac{x}{\epsilon},Du^\epsilon\right)=0 \qquad &amp,\text{in} \ \mathbb{R}^n \times (0,\infty), u^\epsilon(x,0)=g(x) \qquad &amp,\text{on} \ \mathbb{R}^n, \end{cases} \end{equation*} and \begin{equation*} {\rm (C)} \qquad \begin{cases} u_t+\overline{H}\left(Du\right)=0 \qquad &amp,\text{in} \ \mathbb{R}^n \times (0,\infty), u(x,0)=g(x) \qquad &amp,\text{on} \ \mathbb{R}^n, \end{cases} \end{equation*} respectively. We assume that the Hamiltonian $H=H(y,p)$ is coercive and convex in the $p$ variable and is $\mathbb{Z}^n$-periodic in the $y$ variable, and the initial data $g$ is bounded and Lipschitz continuous.;math.AP
1801.00392;Exponents of class groups of certain imaginary quadratic fields;Let $n&gt,1$ be an odd integer. We prove that there are infinitely many imaginary quadratic fields of the form $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{x^2-2y^n})$ whose ideal class group has an element of order $n$. This family gives a counter example to a conjecture by H. Wada \cite{WA70} on the structure of ideal class groups.;math.NT
1801.00394;Generalized Compression Strategy for the Downlink Cloud Radio Access Network;This paper studies the downlink of a cloud radio access network (C-RAN) in which a centralized processor (CP) communicates with mobile users through base stations (BSs) that are connected to the CP via finite-capacity fronthaul links. Information theoretically, the downlink of a C-RAN is modeled as a two-hop broadcast-relay network. Among the various transmission and relaying strategies for such model, this paper focuses on the compression strategy, in which the CP centrally encodes the signals to be broadcasted jointly by the BSs, then compresses and sends these signals to the BSs through the fronthaul links. This paper characterizes an achievable rate region for a generalized compression strategy with Marton's multicoding for broadcasting and multivariate compression for fronthaul transmission. We then compare this rate region with the distributed decode-forward (DDF) scheme, which achieves the capacity of the general relay networks to within a constant gap, and show that the difference lies in that DDF performs Marton's multicoding and multivariate compression jointly as opposed to successively as in the compression strategy. A main result of this paper is that under the assumption that the fronthaul links are subject to a \emph{sum} capacity constraint this difference is immaterial, so the successive encoding based compression strategy can already achieve the capacity region of the C-RAN to within a constant gap, where the gap is independent of the channel parameters and the power constraints at the BSs. For the special case of the Gaussian network, we further establish that under individual fronthaul constraints, the compression strategy achieves to within a constant gap to the \emph{sum} capacity of the C-RAN.;cs.IT
1801.00396;Towards multifractional calculus;After motivating the need of a multiscale version of fractional calculus in quantum gravity, we review current proposals and the program to be carried out in order to reach a viable definition of scale-dependent fractional operators. We present different types of multifractional Laplacians and comment on their known or expected properties.;math-ph
1801.00398;Scalable Hash-Based Estimation of Divergence Measures;We propose a scalable divergence estimation method based on hashing. Consider two continuous random variables $X$ and $Y$ whose densities have bounded support. We consider a particular locality sensitive random hashing, and consider the ratio of samples in each hash bin having non-zero numbers of Y samples. We prove that the weighted average of these ratios over all of the hash bins converges to f-divergences between the two samples sets. We show that the proposed estimator is optimal in terms of both MSE rate and computational complexity. We derive the MSE rates for two families of smooth functions, the H\"{o}lder smoothness class and differentiable functions. In particular, it is proved that if the density functions have bounded derivatives up to the order $d/2$, where $d$ is the dimension of samples, the optimal parametric MSE rate of $O(1/N)$ can be achieved. The computational complexity is shown to be $O(N)$, which is optimal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical divergence estimator that has optimal computational complexity and achieves the optimal parametric MSE estimation rate.;cs.IT
1801.00399;Computation of Maximal Determinants of Binary Circulant Matrices;We describe algorithms for computing maximal determinants of binary circulant matrices of small orders. Here "binary matrix" means a matrix whose elements are drawn from $\{0,1\}$ or $\{-1,1\}$. We describe efficient parallel algorithms for the search, using Duval's algorithm for generation of necklaces and the well-known representation of the determinant of a circulant in terms of roots of unity. Tables of maximal determinants are given for orders $\le 53$ (in the first case) or $\le 52$ (in the second case). Our computations extend earlier results and disprove two plausible conjectures.;math.CO
1801.00400;Value Functions and Optimality Conditions for Nonconvex Variational Problems with an Infinite Horizon in Banach Spaces;We investigate the value function of an infinite horizon variational problem in the infinite-dimensional setting. Firstly, we provide an upper estimate of its Dini--Hadamard subdifferential in terms of the Clarke subdifferential of the Lipschitz continuous integrand and the Clarke normal cone to the graph of the set-valued mapping describing dynamics. Secondly, we derive a necessary condition for optimality in the form of an adjoint inclusion that grasps a connection between the Euler--Lagrange condition and the maximum principle.;math.OC
1801.00403;Exact eigenfunction amplitude distributions of integrable quantum billiards;The exact probability distributions of the amplitudes of eigenfunctions, $\Psi(x, y)$, of several integrable planar billiards are analytically calculated and shown to possess singularities at $\Psi = 0$, the nature of this singularity is shape-dependent. In particular, we prove that the distribution function for a rectangular quantum billiard is proportional to the complete elliptic integral, ${\bf K}(1 - \Psi ^2)$, and demonstrate its universality, modulo a weak dependence on quantum numbers. On the other hand, we study the low-lying states of nonseparable, integrable triangular billiards and find the distributions thereof to be described by the Meijer G-function or certain hypergeometric functions. Our analysis captures a marked departure from the Gaussian distributions for chaotic billiards in its survey of the fluctuations of the eigenfunctions about $\Psi = 0$.;math-ph
1801.00406;Reduced Dimensional Optimal Vector Linear Index Codes for Index Coding Problems with Symmetric Neighboring and Consecutive Side-information;A single unicast index coding problem (SUICP) with symmetric neighboring and consecutive side-information (SNCS) has $K$ messages and $K$ receivers, the $k$th receiver $R_k$ wanting the $k$th message $x_k$ and having the side-information $\mathcal{K}_k=\{x_{k-U},\dots,x_{k-2},x_{k-1}\}\cup\{x_{k+1}, x_{k+2},\dots,x_{k+D}\}$. The single unicast index coding problem with symmetric neighboring and consecutive side-information, SUICP(SNCS), is motivated by topological interference management problems in wireless communication networks. Maleki, Cadambe and Jafar obtained the symmetric capacity of this SUICP(SNCS) and proposed optimal length codes by using Vandermonde matrices. In our earlier work, we gave optimal length $(U+1)$-dimensional vector linear index codes for SUICP(SNCS) satisfying some conditions on $K,D$ and $U$ \cite{VaR1}. In this paper, for SUICP(SNCS) with arbitrary $K,D$ and $U$, we construct optimal length $\frac{U+1}{\text{gcd}(K,D-U,U+1)}$-dimensional vector linear index codes. We prove that the constructed vector linear index code is of minimal dimension if $\text{gcd}(K-D+U,U+1)$ is equal to $\text{gcd}(K,D-U,U+1)$. The proposed construction gives optimal length scalar linear index codes for the SUICP(SNCS) if $(U+1)$ divides both $K$ and $D-U$. The proposed construction is independent of field size and works over every field. We give a low-complexity decoding for the SUICP(SNCS). By using the proposed decoding method, every receiver is able to decode its wanted message symbol by simply adding some index code symbols (broadcast symbols).;cs.IT
1801.00410;Enhanced ${q}$-Least Mean Square;In this work, a new class of stochastic gradient algorithm is developed based on $q$-calculus. Unlike the existing $q$-LMS algorithm, the proposed approach fully utilizes the concept of $q$-calculus by incorporating time-varying $q$ parameter. The proposed enhanced $q$-LMS ($Eq$-LMS) algorithm utilizes a novel, parameterless concept of error-correlation energy and normalization of signal to ensure high convergence, stability and low steady-state error. The proposed algorithm automatically adapts the learning rate with respect to the error. For the evaluation purpose the system identification problem is considered. Extensive experiments show better performance of the proposed $Eq$-LMS algorithm compared to the standard $q$-LMS approach.;math.OC
1801.00413;Hitting Time Quasi-metric and Its Forest Representation;Let $\hat m_{ij}$ be the hitting (mean first passage) time from state $i$ to state $j$ in an $n$-state ergodic homogeneous Markov chain with transition matrix $T$. Let $\Gamma$ be the weighted digraph whose vertex set coincides with the set of states of the Markov chain and arc weights are equal to the corresponding transition probabilities. It holds that $$ \hat m_{ij}= q_j^{-1}\cdot \begin{cases} f_{ij},&amp,\text{if }\,\, i\ne j,\\ q, &amp,\text{if }\,\, i=j, \end{cases} $$ where $f_{ij}$ is the total weight of 2-tree spanning converging forests in $\Gamma$ that have one tree containing $i$ and the other tree converging to $j$, $q_j$ is the total weight of spanning trees converging to $j$ in $\Gamma,$ and $q=\sum_{j=1}^nq_j$ is the total weight of all spanning trees in $\Gamma.$ Moreover, $f_{ij}$ and $q_j$ can be calculated by an algebraic recurrent procedure. A forest expression for Kemeny's constant is an immediate consequence of this result. Further, we discuss the properties of the hitting time quasi-metric $m$ on the set of vertices of $\Gamma$: $m(i,j)=\hat m_{ij}$, $i\neq j$, and $m(i,i)=0$. We also consider a number of other metric structures on the set of graph vertices related to the hitting time quasi-metric $m$---along with various connections between them. The notions and relationships under study are illustrated by two examples.;math.CO
1801.00416;Permutations with small maximal $k$-consecutive sums;Let $n$ and $k$ be positive integers with $n&gt,k$. Given a permutation $(\pi_1,\ldots,\pi_n)$ of integers $1,\ldots,n$, we consider $k$-consecutive sums of $\pi$, i.e., $s_i:=\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}\pi_{i+j}$ for $i=1,\ldots,n$, where we let $\pi_{n+j}=\pi_j$. What we want to do in this paper is to know the exact value of $$\mathrm{msum}(n,k):=\min\left\{\max\{s_i : i=1,\ldots,n\} -\frac{k(n+1)}{2}: \pi \in S_n\right\},$$ where $S_n$ denotes the set of all permutations of $1,\ldots,n$. In this paper, we determine the exact values of $\mathrm{msum}(n,k)$ for some particular cases of $n$ and $k$. As a corollary of the results, we obtain $\mathrm{msum}(n,3)$, $\mathrm{msum}(n,4)$ and $\mathrm{msum}(n,6)$ for any $n$.;math.CO
1801.00417;Construction of $J^{\text{th}}$-stage Nonuniform Wavelets on Local Fields;Shah and Abdullah [Complex Analysis Operator Theory, 9 (2015), 1589-1608] have introduced a generalized notion of nonuniform multiresolution analysis (NUMRA) on local field $K$ of positive characteristic in which the translation set $\Lambda$ acting on the scaling function to generate the core space $V_{0}$ is no longer a group, but is the union of ${\mathcal Z}$ and a translate of ${\mathcal Z}$, given by $\Lambda=\left\{0,u(r)/N \right\}+{\mathcal Z}$, where $N \ge 1$ is an integer and $r$ is an odd integer such that $r$ and $N$ are relatively prime, and ${\mathcal Z}=\{u(n): n\in\mathbb N_{0}\}$ is a complete list of distinct cosets of the unit disc $\mathfrak D$ in $K^+.$ In this paper, we focus on the extension of nonuniform continuous wavelets to the construction of $J^{\text{th}}$-stage nonuniform discrete wavelets on local fields. We establish some general characterizations for the $J^{\text{th}}$-stage nonuniform discrete wavelet systems to be orthornormal bases in $L^2(\Lambda)$. Moreover, we establish a relation between the continuous wavelets of $L^2(K)$ and their discrete counterparts of $l^2(\Lambda)$.;math.FA
1801.00419;A study concerning splitting and jointly continuous topologies on $C(Y,Z)$;Let $Y$ and $Z$ be two fixed topological spaces and $C(Y,Z)$ the set of all continuous maps from $Y$ into $Z$. We construct and study topologies on $C(Y,Z)$ that we call ${\cal F}_n(\tau_n)$-family-open topologies. Furthermore, we find necessary and sufficient conditions such that these topologies to be splitting and jointly continuous. Finally, we present questions concerning a further study on this area.;math.GN
1801.00420;Existence and uniqueness of solutions for a quasilinear KdV equation with degenerate dispersion;We consider a quasilinear KdV equation that admits compactly supported traveling wave solutions (compactons). This model is one of the most straightforward instances of degenerate dispersion, a phenomenon that appears in a variety of physical settings as diverse as sedimentation, magma dynamics and shallow water waves. We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions with sufficiently smooth, spatially localized initial data.;math.AP
1801.00421;Three-dimensional Ricci-degenerate Riemannian manifolds satisfying geometric equations;In this paper, we study a three-dimensional Ricci-degenerate Riemannian manifold $(M^3,g)$ that admits a smooth nonzero solution $f$ to the equation \begin{align} \label{a1a} <br />\nabla df=\psi Rc+\phi g, \end{align} where $\psi,\phi$ are given smooth functions of $f$, $Rc$ is the Ricci tensor of $g$. Spaces of this type include various interesting classes, namely gradient Ricci solitons, $m$-quasi Einstein metrics, (vacuum) static spaces, $V$-static spaces, and critical point metrics. <br />The $m$-quasi Einstein metrics and vacuum static spaces were previously studied in \cite{JJ,JEK}, respectively. In this paper, we refine them and develop a general approach for the solutions of (\ref{a1a}), we specify the shape of the metric $g$ satisfying (\ref{a1a}) when $\nabla f$ is not a Ricci-eigen vector. Then we focus on the remaining three classes, namely gradient Ricci solitons, $V$-static spaces, and critical point metrics. Furthermore, we present classifications of local three-dimensional Ricci-degenerate spaces of these three classes by explicitly describing the metric $g$ and the potential function $f$.;math.DG
1801.00422;Espaces de Banach-Colmez et faisceaux coh&#xe9,rents sur la courbe de Fargues-Fontaine;We give a new definition, simpler but equivalent, of the abelian category of Banach-Colmez spaces introduced by Colmez, and we explain the precise relationship with the category of coherent sheaves on the Fargues-Fontaine curve. One goes from one category to the other by changing the t-structure on the derived category. Along the way, we obtain a description of the pro-\'etale cohomology of the open disk and the affine space, of independent interest.;math.NT

We show that if the elementary theory of $\mathcal M$ is decidable then (1) the relation $Q( a) \rightleftharpoons$ "there is an infinite branch in the tree $Tr( a,x,y)$" is definable in $\mathcal M$, and (2) if there is an infinite branch in the tree $Tr( a,x,y)$, then there is a definable in $\mathcal M$ infinite branch.;math.LO
1801.00427;Fermat&#x27,s dilemma: Why did he keep mum on infinitesimals? and the European theological context;The first half of the 17th century was a time of intellectual ferment when wars of natural philosophy were echoes of religious wars, as we illustrate by a case study of an apparently innocuous mathematical technique called adequality pioneered by the honorable judge Pierre de Fermat, its relation to indivisibles, as well as to other hocus-pocus. Andre Weil noted that simple applications of adequality involving polynomials can be treated purely algebraically but more general problems like the cycloid curve cannot be so treated and involve additional tools--leading the mathematician Fermat potentially into troubled waters. Breger attacks Tannery for tampering with Fermat's manuscript but it is Breger who tampers with Fermat's procedure by moving all terms to the left-hand side so as to accord better with Breger's own interpretation emphasizing the double root idea. We provide modern proxies for Fermat's procedures in terms of relations of infinite proximity as well as the standard part function. <br />Keywords: adequality, atomism, cycloid, hylomorphism, indivisibles, infinitesimal, jesuat, jesuit, Edict of Nantes, Council of Trent 13.2;math.HO

This cohomology theory factors through the category of rigid analytic motives of Ayoub.;math.NT
1801.00431;Ultra-Reliable Cooperative Short-Packet Communications with Wireless Energy Transfer;We analyze a cooperative wireless communication system with finite block length and finite battery energy, under quasi-static Rayleigh fading. Source and relay nodes are powered by a wireless energy transfer (WET) process, while using the harvested energy to feed their circuits, send pilot signals to estimate channels at receivers, and for wireless information transmission (WIT). Other power consumption sources beyond data transmission power are considered. The error probability is investigated under perfect/imperfect channel state information (CSI), while reaching accurate closed-form approximations in ideal direct communication system setups. We consider ultra-reliable communication (URC) scenarios under discussion for the next fifth-generation (5G) of wireless systems. The numerical results show the existence of an optimum pilot transmit power for channel estimation, which increases with the harvested energy. We also show the importance of cooperation, even taking into account the multiplexing loss, in order to meet the error and latency constraints of the URC systems.;cs.IT
1801.00435;Analysis and Code Design for the Binary CEO Problem under Logarithmic Loss;In this paper, we propose an efficient coding scheme for the binary Chief Executive Officer (CEO) problem under logarithmic loss criterion. Courtade and Weissman obtained the exact rate-distortion bound for a two-link binary CEO problem under this criterion. We find the optimal test-channel model and its parameters for the encoder of each link by using the given bound. Furthermore, an efficient encoding scheme based on compound LDGM-LDPC codes is presented to achieve the theoretical rates. In the proposed encoding scheme, a binary quantizer using LDGM codes and a syndrome-decoding employing LDPC codes are applied. An iterative decoding is also presented as a fusion center to reconstruct the observation bits. The proposed decoder consists of a sum-product algorithm with a side information from other decoder and a soft estimator. The output of the CEO decoder is the probability of source bits conditional to the received sequences of both links. This method outperforms the majority-based estimation of the source bits utilized in the prior studies of the binary CEO problem. Our numerical examples verify a close performance of the proposed coding scheme to the theoretical bound in several cases.;cs.IT
1801.00438;On eigenfunctions and maximal cliques of Paley graphs of square order;In this paper we find new maximal cliques of size $\frac{q+1}{2}$ or $\frac{q+3}{2}$, accordingly as $q\equiv 1(4)$ or $q\equiv 3(4)$, in Paley graphs of order $q^2$, where $q$ is an odd prime power. After that we use new cliques to define a family of eigenfunctions corresponding to both non-principal eigenvalues and having the cardinality of support $q+1$, which is the minimum by the weight-distribution bound.;math.CO

Given positive integers $a,b,c,k$ and an odd prime number $p$ with $p\nmid c$, we employ the theory of ternary quadratic forms to determine completely when the mixed sum $ax^2+by^2+cP_{p^k+2}(z)$ represents all but finitely many positive integers.;math.NT
1801.00443;Capacity Characterization of UAV-Enabled Two-User Broadcast Channel;Although prior works have exploited the UAV's mobility to enhance the wireless communication performance under different setups, the fundamental capacity limits of UAV-enabled/aided multiuser communication systems have not yet been characterized. To fill this gap, we consider in this paper a UAV-enabled two-user broadcast channel (BC), where a UAV flying at a constant altitude is deployed to send independent information to two users at different fixed locations on the ground. We aim to characterize the capacity region of this new type of BC over a given UAV flight duration, by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and transmit power/rate allocations over time, subject to the UAV's maximum speed and maximum transmit power constraints. First, to draw essential insights, we consider two special cases with asymptotically large/low UAV flight duration/speed, respectively. For the former case, it is shown that a simple hover-fly-hover (HFH) UAV trajectory with time division multiple access (TDMA) based orthogonal multiuser transmission is capacity-achieving, while in the latter case, the UAV should hover at a fixed location that is nearer to the user with larger achievable rate and in general superposition coding (SC) based non-orthogonal transmission with interference cancellation at the receiver of the nearer user is required. Next, we consider the general case with finite UAV speed and flight duration. We show that the optimal UAV trajectory should follow a general HFH structure, i.e., the UAV successively hovers at a pair of initial and final locations above the line segment of the two users each with a certain amount of time and flies unidirectionally between them at the maximum speed, and SC is generally needed.;cs.IT
1801.00444;Common Throughput Maximization in UAV-Enabled OFDMA Systems with Delay Consideration;The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as communication platforms is of great practical significance in future wireless networks, especially for on-demand deployment in temporary events and emergency situations. Although prior works have shown the performance improvement by exploiting the UAV's mobility, they mainly focus on delay-tolerant applications. As delay requirements fundamentally limit the UAV's mobility, it remains unknown whether the UAV is able to provide any performance gain in delay-constrained communication scenarios. Motivated by this, we study in this paper a UAV-enabled orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) network where a UAV is dispatched as a mobile base station (BS) to serve a group of users on the ground. We consider a minimum-rate ratio (MRR) for each user, defined as the minimum instantaneous rate required over the average achievable throughput, to flexibly adjust the percentage of its delay-constrained data traffic. Under a given set of constraints on the users' MRRs, we aim to maximize the minimum average throughput of all users by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory and OFDMA resource allocation. First, we show that the max-min throughput in general decreases as the users' MRR constraints become more stringent, which reveals a fundamental throughput-delay tradeoff in UAV-enabled communications. Next, we propose an iterative parameter-assisted block coordinate descent method to optimize the UAV trajectory and OFDMA resource allocation alternately, by applying the successive convex optimization and the Lagrange duality, respectively. Furthermore, an efficient and systematic UAV trajectory initialization scheme is proposed based on a simple circular trajectory. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs.;cs.IT
1801.00450;An Efficient, Second Order Accurate, Universal Generalized Riemann Problem Solver Based on the HLLI Riemann Solver;The Riemann problem, and the associated generalized Riemann problem, are increasingly seen as the important building blocks for modern higher order Godunov-type schemes. In the past, building a generalized Riemann problem solver was seen as an intricately mathematical task for complicated physical or engineering problems because the associated Riemann problem is different for each hyperbolic system of interest. This paper changes that situation. <br />The HLLI Riemann solver is a recently-proposed Riemann solver that is universal in that it is applicable to any hyperbolic system, whether in conservation form or with non-conservative products. The HLLI Riemann solver is also complete in the sense that if it is given a complete set of eigenvectors, it represents all waves with minimal dissipation. It is, therefore, very attractive to build a generalized Riemann problem solver version of the HLLI Riemann solver. This is the task that is accomplished in the present paper. We show that at second order, the generalized Riemann problem version of the HLLI Riemann solver is easy to design. Our GRP solver is also complete and universal because it inherits those good properties from original HLLI Riemann solver. We also show how our GRP solver can be adapted to the solution of hyperbolic systems with stiff source terms. <br />Our generalized HLLI Riemann solver is easy to implement and performs robustly and well over a range of test problems. All implementation-related details are presented. Results from several stringent test problems are shown. These test problems are drawn from many different hyperbolic systems, and include hyperbolic systems in conservation form, with non-conservative products, and with stiff source terms. The present generalized Riemann problem solver performs well on all of them.;math.NA
1801.00457;Kinetic layers and coupling conditions for nonlinear scalar equations on networks;We consider a kinetic relaxation model and an associated macroscopic scalar nonlinear hyperbolic equation on a network. Coupling conditions for the macroscopic equations are derived from the kinetic coupling conditions via an asymptotic analysis near the nodes of the network. This analysis leads to the combination of kinetic half-space problems with Riemann problems at the junction. Detailed numerical comparisons between the different models show the agreement of the coupling conditions for the case of tripod networks.;math.AP
1801.00459;Geometry of complex bounded domains with finite-volume quotients;We first show that for a bounded pseudoconvex domain with a manifold quotient of finite-volume in the sense of Kahler-Einstein measure, the identity component of the automorphism group of this domain is semi-simple without compact factors. This partially answers an open question in [Fra95]. Then we apply this result in different settings to solve several open problems, for examples, <br />(1). We prove that the automorphism group of the Griffiths domain [Gri71] in $\mathbb{C}^2$ is discrete. This gives a complete answer to an open question raised four decades ago. <br />(2). We show that for a contractible HHR/USq complex manifold $D$ with a finite-volume manifold quotient $M$, if $D$ contains a one-parameter group of holomorphic automorphisms and the fundamental group of $M$ is irreducible, then $D$ is biholomorphic to a bounded symmetric domain. This theorem can be viewed as a finite-volume version of Nadel-Frankel's solution for the Kahzdan conjecture, which has been open for years. <br />(3). We show that for a bounded convex domain $D\subset \mathbb{C}^n$ of $C^2$-smooth boundary, if $D$ has a finite-volume manifold quotient with an irreducible fundamental group, then $D$ is biholomorphic to the unit ball in $\mathbb{C}^n$, which partially solves an old conjecture of Yau. <br />For (2) and (3) above, if the complex dimension is equal to $2$, more refined results will be provided.;math.DG
1801.00463;On spectra of quadratic operator pencils with rank one gyroscopic linear part;The spectrum of a selfadjoint quadratic operator pencil of the form $\lambda^2M-\lambda G-A$ is investigated where $M\geq 0$, $G\geq 0$ are bounded operators and $A$ is selfadjoint bounded below is investigated. It is shown that in the case of rank one operator $G$ the eigenvalues of such a pencil are of two types. The eigenvalues of one of these types are independent of the operator $G$. Location of the eigenvalues of both types is described. Examples for the case of the Sturm-Liouville operators $A$ are given.;math-ph

For $n=3$, we get a detailed description of such spaces. The euclidean 2-spheres were considered by W. P. Thurston: for $n=4$, the corresponding spaces provide the famous 7 examples of nonarithmetic compact holomorphic 2-ball quotients previously constructed by Deligne-Mostow.;math.GT

1801.00468;On Equitable Coloring Parameters of Certain Cycle Related Graphs;Coloring the vertices of a graph G subject to given conditions can be considered as a random experiment and corresponding to this experiment, a discrete random variable X can be defined as the colour of a vertex chosen at random, with respect to the given type of colouring of G and a probability mass function for this random variable can be defined accordingly. A proper coloring C of a graph G, which assigns colors to the vertices of G such that the numbers of vertices in any two colour classes differ by at most one, is called an equitable colouring of G. In this paper, we study two statistical parameters of certain cycle related graphs, with respect to their equitable colorings.;math.GM
1801.00474;Anti-Ramsey Multiplicities;The Ramsey multiplicity constant of a graph $H$ is the minimum proportion of copies of $H$ in the complete graph which are monochromatic under an edge-coloring of $K_n$ as $n$ goes to infinity. Graphs for which this minimum is asymptotically achieved by taking a random coloring are called {\em common}, and common graphs have been studied extensively, leading to the Burr-Rosta conjecture and Sidorenko's conjecture. Erd\H{o}s and S\'os asked what the maximum number of rainbow triangles is in a $3$-coloring of the edge set of $K_n$, a rainbow version of the Ramsey multiplicity question. A graph $H$ is called $r$-anti-common if the maximum proportion of rainbow copies of $H$ in any $r$-coloring of $E(K_n)$ is asymptotically achieved by taking a random coloring. In this paper, we investigate anti-Ramsey multiplicity for several families of graphs. We determine classes of graphs which are either anti-common or not. Some of these classes follow the same behavior as the monochromatic case, but some of them do not. In particular the rainbow equivalent of Sidorenko's conjecture, that all bipartite graphs are anti-common, is false.;math.CO
1801.00480;The Cyclic Douglas-Rachford Algorithm with r-sets-Douglas-Rachford Operators;The Douglas-Rachford (DR) algorithm is an iterative procedure that uses sequential reflections onto convex sets and which has become popular for convex feasibility problems.

We prove convergence and present numerical illustrations of the potential advantage of such operators with $r&gt,2$ over the classical $2$-sets-DR operators in a cyclic algorithm.;math.OC
1801.00485;Rigorous results for the distribution of money on connected graphs;This paper is concerned with general spatially explicit versions of three stochastic models for the dynamics of money that have been introduced and studied numerically by statistical physicists: the uniform reshuffling model, the immediate exchange model and the model with saving propensity. All three models consist of systems of economical agents that consecutively engage in pairwise monetary transactions. Computer simulations performed in the physics literature suggest that, when the number of agents and the average amount of money per agent are large, the distribution of money at equilibrium approaches the exponential distribution for the first model, the gamma distribution with shape parameter two for the second model and a gamma distribution whose shape parameter depends on the saving propensity for the third model. The main objective of this paper is to give rigorous proofs of and extend these conjectures to generalizations of the first two models and a variant of the third model that include local rather than global interactions, i.e., instead of choosing the two interacting agents uniformly at random from the system, the agents are located on the vertex set of a general connected graph and can only interact with their neighbors.;math.PR

We show that the Feynman propagator is an example of a reproducing kernel under a boundedness condition. To every Lagrangian thus corresponds a Hilbert space that does not need to be postulated \emph{a priori}. For the free non-relativistic particle, we justify mathematically the concept of space-time granularity. Reproducing kernels allow for a functional, rather than distributional, description of the Hilbert spaces of quantum theory, including the Fock space.;math-ph

We end with some remarks on binary tensors.;math.CO
1801.00501;Hereditary Semiorders and Enumeration of Semiorders by Dimension;In 2010, Bousquet-M\'elou et al. defined sequences of nonnegative integers called ascent sequences and showed that the ascent sequences of length $n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the interval orders, i.e., the posets not containing the poset $\mathbf{2}+\mathbf{2}$. Through the use of generating functions, this provided an answer to the longstanding open question of enumerating the (unlabeled) interval orders. A semiorder is an interval order having a representation in which all intervals have the same length. In terms of forbidden subposets, the semiorders exclude $\mathbf{2}+\mathbf{2}$ and $\mathbf{1}+\mathbf{3}$. The number of unlabeled semiorders on $n$ points has long been known to be the $n$-th Catalan number. However, describing the ascent sequences that correspond to the semiorders under the bijection of Bousquet-M\'elou et al. has proved difficult. In this paper, we discuss a major part of the difficulty in this area: the ascent sequence corresponding to a semiorder may have an initial subsequence that corresponds to an interval order that is not a semiorder. <br />We define the hereditary semiorders to be those corresponding to an ascent sequence for which every initial subsequence also corresponds to a semiorder. We provide a structural result that characterizes the hereditary semiorders and use this characterization to determine the ordinary generating function for hereditary semiorders. We also use our characterization of hereditary semiorders and the characterization of semiorders of dimension 3 given by Rabinovitch to provide a structural description of the semiorders of dimension at most 2. From this description, we are able to determine the ordinary generating for the semiorders of dimension at most 2.;math.CO
1801.00502;Structure of the flow and Yamada polynomials of cubic graphs;We establish a quadratic identity for the Yamada polynomial of ribbon cubic graphs in 3-space, extending the Tutte golden identity for planar cubic graphs. An application is given to the structure of the flow polynomial of cubic graphs at zero. The golden identity for the flow polynomial is conjectured to characterize planarity of cubic graphs, and we prove this conjecture for a certain infinite family of non-planar graphs. <br />Further, we establish exponential growth of the number of chromatic polynomials of planar triangulations, answering a question of D. Treumann and E. Zaslow. The structure underlying these results is the chromatic algebra, and more generally the SO(3) topological quantum field theory.;math.CO
1801.00503;Smooth solutions to the complex Plateau problem;Building on work of Du, Gao, and Yau, we give a characterization of smooth solutions, up to normalization, of the complex Plateau problem for strongly pseudoconvex Calabi--Yau CR manifolds of dimension $2n-1 \ge 5$ and in the hypersurface case when $n=2$. The latter case was completely solved by Yau for $n \ge 3$ but only partially solved by Du and Yau for $n=2$. As an application, we determine the existence of a link-theoretic invariant of normal isolated singularities that distinguishes smooth points from singular ones.;math.CV
1801.00505;Optimal Stochastic Management of Distributed Energy Storage Embedded with Wind Farms;Increasing wind turbines (WT) penetration and low carbon demand can potentially lead to two different flow peaks, generation and load, within distribution networks. This will not only constrain WT penetration but also pose serious threats to network reliability. This paper proposes energy storage (ES) to reduce system congestion cost caused by the two peaks by sending cost-reflective economic signals to affect ES operation in responding to network conditions. Firstly, a new charging and discharging (C/D) strategy based on Binary Search Method is designed for ES, which responds to system congestion cost over time. Then, a novel pricing method, based on Location Marginal Pricing, is designed for ES. The pricing model is derived by evaluating ES impact on the network power flows and congestion from the loss and congestion components in Location Marginal Pricing. The impact is then converted into an hourly economic signal to reflect ES operation. The proposed ES C/D strategy and pricing methods are validated on a real local Grid Supply Point area. Results show that the proposed Location Marginal Pricing-based pricing is efficient to capture the feature of ES and provide signals for affecting its operation. This work can further increase network flexibility and the capability of networks to accommodate increasing WT penetration.;math.OC

1801.00513;An elementary derivation of the Chinese restaurant process from Sethuraman&#x27,s stick-breaking process;The Chinese restaurant process (CRP) and the stick-breaking process are the two most commonly used representations of the Dirichlet process. However, the usual proof of the connection between them is indirect, relying on abstract properties of the Dirichlet process that are difficult for nonexperts to verify. This short note provides a direct proof that the stick-breaking process leads to the CRP, without using any measure theory. We also discuss how the stick-breaking representation arises naturally from the CRP.;math.ST

Girstmair proved local restrictions on $k$ depending on $q\pmod{12}$ and whether $q$ is a square and conjectured that these are the only restrictions possible. We verify the conjecture in the cases $q$ even, $q$ a square divisible by $3$ or $5$, and $2\le q\le 200$ (the latter by computer), and provide progress towards a general approach.;math.NT
1801.00518;Statistical and Computational Limits for Sparse Matrix Detection;This paper investigates the fundamental limits for detecting a high-dimensional sparse matrix contaminated by white Gaussian noise from both the statistical and computational perspectives. We consider $p\times p$ matrices whose rows and columns are individually $k$-sparse. We provide a tight characterization of the statistical and computational limits for sparse matrix detection, which precisely describe when achieving optimal detection is easy, hard, or impossible, respectively. Although the sparse matrices considered in this paper have no apparent submatrix structure and the corresponding estimation problem has no computational issue at all, the detection problem has a surprising computational barrier when the sparsity level $k$ exceeds the cubic root of the matrix size $p$: attaining the optimal detection boundary is computationally at least as hard as solving the planted clique problem. <br />The same statistical and computational limits also hold in the sparse covariance matrix model, where each variable is correlated with at most $k$ others. A key step in the construction of the statistically optimal test is a structural property for sparse matrices, which can be of independent interest.;math.ST
1801.00521;Asymptotic Gap Probability Distributions of the Gaussian Unitary Ensembles and Jacobi Unitary Ensembles;In this paper, we address a class of problems in unitary ensembles. Specifically, we study the probability that a gap symmetric about 0, i.e. $(-a,a)$ is found in the Gaussian unitary ensembles (GUE) and the Jacobi unitary ensembles (JUE) (where in the JUE, we take the parameters $\alpha=\beta$). By exploiting the even parity of the weight, a doubling of the interval to $(a^2,\infty)$ for the GUE, and $(a^2,1)$, for the (symmetric) JUE, shows that the gap probabilities maybe determined as the product of the smallest eigenvalue distributions of the LUE with parameter $\alpha=-1/2,$ and $\alpha=1/2$ and the (shifted) JUE with weights $x^{1/2}(1-x)^{\beta}$ and $x^{-1/2}(1-x)^{\beta}$ The $\sigma$ function, namely, the derivative of the log of the smallest eigenvalue distributions of the finite-$n$ LUE or the JUE, satisfies the Jimbo-Miwa-Okamoto $\sigma$ form of $P_{V}$ and $P_{VI}$, although in the shift Jacobi case, with the weight $x^{\alpha}(1-x)^{\beta},$ the $\beta$ parameter does not show up in the equation. We also obtain the asymptotic expansions for the smallest eigenvalue distributions of the Laguerre unitary and Jacobi unitary ensembles after appropriate double scalings, and obtained the constants in the asymptotic expansion of the gap probablities, expressed in term of the Barnes $G-$ function valuated at special point.;math-ph
1801.00523;Interval estimators for ratios of independent quantiles and interquantile ranges;Recent research has shown that interval estimators with good coverage properties are achievable for some functions of quantiles, even when sample sizes are not large. Motivated by this, we consider interval estimators for the ratios of independent quantiles and interquantile ranges that will be useful when comparing location and scale for two samples. Simulations show that the intervals have excellent coverage properties for a wide range of distributions, including those that are heavily skewed. Examples are also considered that highlight the usefulness of using these approaches to compare location and scale.;math.ST

1801.00539;A local systolic-diastolic inequality in contact and symplectic geometry;Let $\Sigma$ be a connected closed three-manifold, and let $t_\Sigma$ be the order of the torsion subgroup of $H_1(\Sigma,\mathbb Z)$. For a contact form $\alpha$ on $\Sigma$, we denote by $\mathrm{Volume}(\alpha)$ the contact volume of $\alpha$, and by $T_{\min}(\alpha)$ and $T_{\max}(\alpha)$ the minimal period and the maximal period of prime periodic orbits of the Reeb flow of $\alpha$ respectively. We say that $\alpha$ is Zoll if its Reeb flow generates a free $S^1$-action on $\Sigma$. We prove that every Zoll contact form $\alpha_*$ on $\Sigma$ admits a $C^3$-neighbourhood $\mathcal U$ in the space of contact forms such that \[ t_\Sigma T_{\min}(\alpha)^2\leq \mathrm{Volume}(\alpha)\leq t_\Sigma T_{\max}(\alpha)^2,\qquad \forall\,\alpha\in\mathcal U, \] and any of the equalities holds if and only if $\alpha$ is Zoll. <br />We extend the above picture to odd-symplectic forms $\Omega$ on $\Sigma$ of arbitrary odd dimension. We define the volume of $\Omega$, which generalises both the contact volume and the Calabi invariant of Hamiltonian functions, and the action of closed characteristics of $\Omega$, which generalises both the period of periodic Reeb orbits and the action of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. We say that $\Omega$ is Zoll if its characteristics are the orbits of a free $S^1$-action on $\Sigma$. We prove that the volume and the action of a Zoll odd-symplectic form satisfy a certain polynomial equation. This builds the equality case of a conjectural local systolic-diastolic inequality for odd-symplectic forms, which we establish in some cases. This inequality recovers the inequality between the minimal action and the Calabi invariant of Hamiltonian isotopies $C^1$-close to the identity on a closed symplectic manifold, as well as the local contact systolic-diastolic inequality above. <br />Finally, applications to magnetic geodesics are discussed.;math.SG
1801.00542;Normal approximations for discrete-time occupancy processes;We study normal approximations for a class of discrete-time occupancy processes, namely, Markov chains with transition kernels of product Bernoulli form. This class encompasses numerous models which appear in the complex networks literature, including stochastic patch occupancy models in ecology, network models in epidemiology, and a variety of dynamic random graph models. Bounds on the rate of convergence for a central limit theorem are obtained using Stein's method and moment inequalities on the deviation from an analogous deterministic model. As a consequence, our work also implies a uniform law of large numbers for a subclass of these processes.;math.PR
1801.00550;Radiality of definable sets;In this article we use techniques developed by Hrushovski-Loeser to study certain metric properties of the Berkovich analytification of a finite morphism of smooth connected projective curves. In recent work, M. Temkin proved a radiality statement for the topological ramification locus associated to such finite morphisms. We generalize this result in two directions. We prove a radiality statement for a more general class of sets which we call definable sets. In another direction, we show that the result of Temkin can be obtained in families.;math.AG
1801.00552;Performance Limits with Additive Error Metrics in Noisy Multi-Measurement Vector Problem;Real-world applications such as magnetic resonance imaging with multiple coils, multi-user communication, and diffuse optical tomography often assume a linear model where several sparse signals sharing common sparse supports are acquired by several measurement matrices and then contaminated by noise. Multi-measurement vector (MMV) problems consider the estimation or reconstruction of such signals. In different applications, the estimation error that we want to minimize could be the mean squared error or other metrics such as the mean absolute error and the support set error. Seeing that minimizing different error metrics is useful in MMV problems, we study information-theoretic performance limits for MMV signal estimation with arbitrary additive error metrics. We also propose a message passing algorithmic framework that achieves the optimal performance, and rigorously prove the optimality of our algorithm for a special case. We further conjecture the optimality of our algorithm for some general cases, and back it up through numerical examples. As an application of our MMV algorithm, we propose a novel setup for active user detection in multi-user communication and demonstrate the promise of our proposed setup.;cs.IT
1801.00556;Uniqueness of solutions for Keller-Segel system of porous medium type coupled to fluid equations;We prove the uniqueness of H\"older continuous weak solutions via duality argument and vanishing viscosity method for the Keller-Segel system of porous medium type equations coupled to the Stokes system in dimensions three. An important step is the estimate of the Green function of parabolic equations with lower order terms of variable coefficients, which seems to be of independent interest.;math.AP
1801.00561;A modified subgradient extragradient method for solving the variational inequality problem;The subgradient extragradient method for solving the variational inequality (VI) problem, which is introduced by Censor et al. \cite{CGR}, replaces the second projection onto the feasible set of the VI, in the extragradient method, with a subgradient projection onto some constructible half-space. Since the method has been introduced, many authors proposed extensions and modifications with applications to various problems. <br />In this paper, we introduce a modified subgradient extragradient method by improving the stepsize of its second step. Convergence of the proposed method is proved under standard and mild conditions and primary numerical experiments illustrate the performance and advantage of this new subgradient extragradient variant.;math.OC
1801.00563;Block Diagonalization Type Precoding Algorithms for IEEE 802.11ac Systems;Block diagonalization (BD) based precoding schemes are well-known linear transmit strategies employed in the downlink of multi-user multiple-input multipleoutput (MU-MIMO) systems. BD type precoding algorithms employed at the transmit side effect the suppression of multi-user interference (MUI) by the decomposition of MU-MIMO broadcast channel into multiple single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO) channels followed by parallelization of the SU-MIMO channels to obtain independent streams of each user. Given that the design of linear precoding algorithms has made significant progress, the implementation of these techniques in standards for wireless local area networks (WLAN) remains an open question. In this work, schemes for implementation of BD based precoding techniques in the framework of IEEE 802.11ac standard are proposed followed by performance evaluation of these techniques in the proposed framework. I analyze the sum-rate and the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the techniques in my framework and obtain computational complexity-wise as well as performance-wise optimal algorithm for my system.;cs.IT
1801.00564;Convergence analysis of the Chebyshev-Legendre spectral method for a class of Fredholm fractional integro-differential equations;In this paper, we propose and analyze a spectral Chebyshev-Legendre approximation for fractional order integro-differential equations of Fredholm type. The fractional derivative is described in the Caputo sense. Our proposed method is illustrated by considering some examples whose exact solutions are available. We prove that the error of the approximate solution decay exponentially in L^2-norm.;math.NA
1801.00570;Periodic solutions for neutral evolution equations with delays;The aim is to study the periodic solution problem for neutral evolution equation <br />$$(u(t)-G(t,u(t-\xi)))'+Au(t)=F(t,u(t),u(t-\tau)),\ \ \ \ t\in\R$$in Banach space $X$, where $A:D(A)\subset X\rightarrow X$ is a closed linear operator, and $-A$ generates a compact analytic operator semigroup $T(t)(t\geq0)$. <br />With the aid of the analytic operator semigroup theories and some fixed point theorems, we obtain the existence and uniqueness of periodic mild solution for neutral evolution equations. The regularity of periodic mild solution for evolution equation with delay is studied, and some the existence results of the classical and strong solutions are obtained. In the end, we give an example to illustrate the applicability of abstract results. Our works greatly improve and generalize the relevant results of existing literatures.;math.FA
1801.00572;Tail empirical process and weighted extreme value index estimator for randomly right-censored data;A tail empirical process for heavy-tailed and right-censored data is introduced and its Gaussian approximation is established. In this context, a (weighted) new Hill-type estimator for positive extreme value index is proposed and its consistency and asymptotic normality are proved by means of the aforementioned process in the framework of second-order conditions of regular variation. In a comparative simulation study, the newly defined estimator is seen to perform better than the already existing ones in terms of both bias and mean squared error. As a real data example, we apply our estimation procedure to evaluate the tail index of the survival time of Australian male Aids patients. It is noteworthy that our approach may also serve to develop other statistics related to the distribution tail such as second-order parameter and reduced-bias tail index estimators. Furthermore, the proposed tail empirical process provides a goodness-of-fit test for Pareto-like models under censorship.;math.ST
1801.00573;Positive periodic solutions for abstract evolution equations with delay;In this paper, we discuss the existence and asymptotic stability of the positive periodic mild solutions for the abstract evolution equation with delay in an ordered Banach space $E$, $$u'(t)+Au(t)=F(t,u(t),u(t-\tau)),\ \ \ \ t\in\R,$$ where $A:D(A)\subset E\rightarrow E$ is a closed linear operator and $-A$ generates a positive $C_{0}$-semigroup $T(t)(t\geq0)$, $F:\R\times E\times E\rightarrow E$ is a continuous mapping which is $\omega$-periodic in $t$. <br />Under order conditions on the nonlinearity $F$ concerning the growth exponent of the semigroup $T(t)(t\geq0)$ or the first eigenvalue of the operator $A$, we obtain the existence and asymptotic stability results of the positive $\omega$-periodic mild solutions by applying operator semigroup theory. In the end, an example is given to illustrate the applicability of our abstract results.;math.FA
1801.00574;Monotone iterative technique for delayed evolution equation periodic problems in Banach spaces;In this paper, we deal with the existence of $\omega$-periodic mild solutions for the abstract evolution equation with delay in an ordered Banach space $E$ $$u'(t)+Au(t)=F(t,u(t),u(t-\tau)),\ \ \ \ t\in\R,$$ where $A:D(A)\subset E\rightarrow E$ is a closed linear operator and $-A$ generates a positive $C_{0}$-semigroup $T(t)(t\geq0)$, $F:\R\times E\times E\rightarrow E$ is a continuous mapping which is $\omega$-periodic in $t$, and $\tau\geq0$ is a constant. Under some weaker assumptions, we construct monotone iterative method for the delayed evolution equation periodic problems, and obtain the existence of maximal and minimal periodic mild solutions. <br />The results obtained generalize the recent conclusions on this topic. Finally, we present two applications to illustrate the feasibility of our abstract results.;math.FA
1801.00575;Existence and Asymptotic Stability of Periodic Solutions for Impulsive Delay Evolution Equations;In this paper, we are devoted to consider the periodic problem for the impulsive evolution equations with delay in Banach space. By using operator semigroups theory and fixed point theorem, we establish some new existence theorems of periodic mild solutions for the equations. In addition, with the aid of an integral inequality with impulsive and delay, we present essential conditions on the nonlinear and impulse functions to guarantee that the equations have an asymptotically stable $\omega$-periodic mild solution.;math.FA
1801.00576;Definably simple stable groups with finitary groups of automorphisms;We prove that infinite definably simple locally finite groups of finite centraliser dimension are simple groups of Lie type over locally finite fields. Then, we identify conditions on automorphisms of a stable group that make it resemble the Frobenius maps, and allow us to classify definably simple stable groups in the specific case when they admit such automorphisms.;math.LO
1801.00577;The variational discretization of the constrained higher-order Lagrange-Poincar&#xe9, equations;In this paper we investigate a variational discretization for the class of mechanical systems in presence of symmetries described by the action of a Lie group which reduces the phase space to a (non-trivial) principal bundle. By introducing a discrete connection we are able to obtain the discrete constrained higher-order Lagrange-Poincar\'e equations. These equations describe the dynamics of a constrained Lagrangian system when the Lagrangian function and the constraints depend on higher-order derivatives such as the acceleration, jerk or jounces. The equations, under some mild regularity conditions, determine a well defined (local) flow which can be used to define a numerical scheme to integrate the constrained higher-order Lagrange-Poincar\'e equations. <br />Optimal control problems for underactuated mechanical systems can be viewed as higher-order constrained variational problems. We study how a variational discretization can be used in the construction of variational integrators for optimal control of underactuated mechanical systems where control inputs act soley on the base manifold of a principal bundle (the shape space). Examples include the energy minimum control of an electron in a magnetic field and two coupled rigid bodies attached at a common center of mass.;math.DS
1801.00578;Non-conforming harmonic virtual element method: $h$- and $p$-versions;We study the $h$- and $p$-versions of non-conforming harmonic virtual element methods (VEM) for the approximation of the Dirichlet-Laplace problem on a 2D polygonal domain, providing quasi-optimal error bounds. Harmonic VEM do not make use of internal degrees of freedom. This leads to a faster convergence, in terms of the number of degrees of freedom, as compared to standard VEM. Importantly, the technical tools used in our $p$-analysis can be employed as well in the analysis of more general non-conforming finite element methods and VEM. The theoretical results are validated in a series of numerical experiments. The $hp$-version of the method is numerically tested, demonstrating exponential convergence with rate given by the square root of the number of degrees of freedom.;math.NA
1801.00580;A formula for the action of Dehn twists on HOMFLY-PT skein modules and its applications;We introduce a formula for the action of Dehn twists on the HOMFLY-PT type skein module of a surface. As an application of the formula to mapping class group, we give an embedding from the Torelli group of a surface $\Sigma_{g,1}$ of genus $g$ with non-empty connected boundary into the completed HOMFLY-PT type skein algebra. As an application of the formula to integral homology $3$-spheres, we construct an invariant $z(M) \in \mathbb{Q} [\rho ] [[h]]$ for an integral homology $3$-sphere $M$. The invariant $z(M) \mod (h^{n+1})$ is a finite type invariant of order $n$.;math.GT
1801.00581;The space of probabilistic 1-lipschitz maps;We introduce and study a natural notion of probabilistic 1-Lipschitz maps. We prove that the space of all probabilistic 1-Lipschitz maps defined on a probabilistic metric space G is also a probabilistic metric space. Moreover, when G is a group, then the space of all prob-abilistic 1-Lipschitz maps defined on G can be endowed with a monoid structure. Then, we caracterize the probabilistic invariant complete Menger groups by the space of all probabilistic 1-Lipschitz maps in the sprit of the classical Banach-Stone theorem.;math.FA
1801.00582;Rankin-Cohen deformations of the algebra of Jacobi forms;The aim of this work is to emphasize the arithmetical and algebraic aspects of the Rankin-Cohen brackets in order to extend them to several natural number-theoretical situations. We build an analytically consistent derivation on the algebra $\widetilde{\mathcal{J}}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$ of weak Jacobi forms. From this derivation, we obtain a sequence of bilinear forms on $\widetilde{\mathcal{J}}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$ that is a formal deformation and whose restriction to the algebra $\mathcal{M}_*$ of modular forms is an analogue of Rankin-Cohen brackets associated to the Serre derivative. Using a classification of all admissible Poisson brackets, we generalize this construction to build a family of Rankin-Cohen deformations of $\widetilde{\mathcal{J}}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$. The algebra $\widetilde{\mathcal{J}}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$ is a polynomial algebra in four generators. We consider some localization $\mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$ of $\widetilde{\mathcal{J}}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$ with respect to one of the generators. We construct Rankin-Cohen deformations on $\mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$. We study their restriction to $\widetilde{\mathcal{J}}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$ and to some subalgebra of $\mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$ naturally isomorphic to the algebra of quasimodular forms.;math.NT
1801.00583;An approximation scheme for semilinear parabolic PDEs with convex and coercive Hamiltonians;We propose an approximation scheme for a class of semilinear parabolic equations that are convex and coercive in their gradients. Such equations arise often in pricing and portfolio management in incomplete markets and, more broadly, are directly connected to the representation of solutions to backward stochastic differential equations. The proposed scheme is based on splitting the equation in two parts, the first corresponding to a linear parabolic equation and the second to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The solutions of these two equations are approximated using, respectively, the Feynman-Kac and the Hopf-Lax formulae. We establish the convergence of the scheme and determine the convergence rate, combining Krylov's shaking coefficients technique and Barles-Jakobsen's optimal switching approximation.;math.OC
1801.00591;Unions of Orthogonal Arrays and their aberrations via Hilbert bases;We generate all the Orthogonal Arrays (OAs) of a given size n and strength t as the union of a collection of OAs which belong to an inclusion-minimal set of OAs. We derive a formula for computing the (Generalized) Word Length Pattern of a union of OAs that makes use of their polynomial counting functions. In this way the best OAs according to the Generalized Minimum Aberration criterion can be found by simply exploring a relatively small set of counting functions. The classes of OAs with 5 binary factors, strength 2, and sizes 16 and 20 are fully described.;math.ST
1801.00606;Secrecy Capacity-Memory Tradeoff of Erasure Broadcast Channels;This paper derives upper and lower bounds on the secrecy capacity-memory tradeoff of a wiretap erasure broadcast channel (BC) with Kw weak receivers and Ks strong receivers, where weak receivers, respectively strong receivers, have same erasure probabilities and cache sizes. The lower bounds are achieved by schemes that meticulously combine joint cache-channel coding with wiretap coding and key-aided one-time pads. The presented upper bound holds more generally for arbitrary degraded BCs and arbitrary cache sizes. When only weak receivers have cache memories, upper and lower bounds coincide for small and large cache memories, thus providing the exact secrecy capacity-memory tradeoff for this setup. The derived bounds allow to further conclude that the secrecy capacity is positive even when the eavesdropper is stronger than all the legitimate receivers with cache memories. Moreover, they show that the secrecy capacity-memory tradeoff can be significantly smaller than its non-secure counterpart, but it grows much faster when cache memories are small. The paper also presents a lower bound on the global secrecy capacity-memory tradeoff where one is allowed to optimize the cache assignment subject to a total cache budget. It is close to the best known lower bound without secrecy constraint. For small total cache budget, the global secrecy capacity-memory tradeoff is achieved by assigning all the available cache memory uniformly over all receivers if the eavesdropper is stronger than all legitimate receivers, and it is achieved by assigning the cache memory uniformly only over the weak receivers if the eavesdropper is weaker than the strong receivers.;cs.IT
1801.00608;On the growth of Lebesgue constants for convex polyhedra;In the paper, new estimates of the Lebesgue constant $$ \mathcal{L}(W)=\frac1{(2\pi)^d}\int_{\mathbb{T}^d}\bigg|\sum_{{k}\in W\cap \mathbb{Z}^d} e^{i({k},\,{x})}\bigg| {\rm d}{ x} $$ for convex polyhedra $W\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ are obtained. The main result states that if $W$ is a convex polyhedron such that $[0,m_1]\times\dots\times [0,m_d]\subset W\subset [0,n_1]\times\dots\times [0,n_d]$, then $$ c(d)\prod_{j=1}^d \log(m_j+1)\le \mathcal{L}(W)\le C(d)s\prod_{j=1}^d \log(n_j+1), $$ where $s$ is a size of the triangulation of $W$.;math.CA
1801.00613;Equivalence between radial solutions of different parabolic gradient-diffusion equations and applications;We consider a general form of a parabolic equation that generalizes both the standard parabolic $p$-Laplace equation and the normalized version that has been proposed in stochastic game theory. We establish an equivalence between this equation and the standard $p$-parabolic equation posed in a fictitious space dimension, valid for radially symmetric solutions. This allows us to find suitable explicit solutions for example of Barenblatt type, and as a consequence we settle the exact asymptotic behaviour of the Cauchy problem even for nonradial data. We also establish the asymptotic behaviour in a bounded domain. Moreover, we use the explicit solutions to establish the parabolic Harnack's inequality.;math.AP
1801.00614;On Bennequin type inequalities for links in tight contact 3-manifolds;We prove that a version of the Thurston-Bennequin inequality holds for Legendrian and transverse links in a rational homology contact 3-sphere $(M,\xi)$, whenever $\xi$ is tight. More specifically, we show that the self-linking number of a transverse link $T$ in $(M,\xi)$, such that the boundary of its tubular neighbourhood consists of incompressible tori, is bounded by the Thurston norm $||T||_T$ of $T$. A similar inequality is given for Legendrian links by using the notions of positive and negative transverse push-off. We apply this bound to compute the tau-invariant for every strongly quasi-positive link in $S^3$. This is done by proving that our inequality is sharp for this family of smooth links. Moreover, we use a stronger Bennequin inequality, for links in the tight 3-sphere, to generalize this result to quasi-positive links and determine their maximal self-linking number.;math.GT
1801.00615;Computational multiscale methods for linear heterogeneous poroelasticity;We consider a strongly heterogeneous medium saturated by an incompressible viscous fluid as it appears in geomechanical modeling. This poroelasticity problem suffers from rapidly oscillating material parameters, which calls for a thorough numerical treatment. In this paper, we propose a method based on the local orthogonal decomposition technique and motivated by a similar approach used for linear thermoelasticity. Therein, local corrector problems are constructed in line with the static equations, whereas we propose to consider the full system. This allows to benefit from the given saddle point structure and results in two decoupled corrector problems for the displacement and the pressure. We prove the optimal first-order convergence of this method and verify the result by numerical experiments.;math.NA
1801.00616;Mixed-Radix Nim;We present take-away games whose Sprague-Grundy functions are given by the Nim sum of heap sizes in a mixed base $\beta$. Let $\Delta_\beta$ be the set of such games. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a minimum of $\Delta_\beta$, and a recursive construction of the maximum of $\Delta_\beta$.;math.CO
1801.00617;Variety of idempotents in nonassociative algebras;In this paper, we study the variety of all nonassociative (NA) algebras from the idempotent point of view. We are interested, in particular, in the spectral properties of idempotents when algebra is generic, i.e. idempotents are in general position. Our main result states that in this case, there exist at least $n-1$ nontrivial obstructions (syzygies) on the Peirce spectrum of a generic NA algebra of dimension $n$. We also discuss the exceptionality of the eigenvalue $\lambda=\frac12$ which appears in the spectrum of idempotents in many classical examples of NA algebras and characterize its extremal properties in metrised algebras.;math.RA
1801.00618;Input to State Stability of Bipedal Walking Robots: Application to DURUS;Bipedal robots are a prime example of systems which exhibit highly nonlinear dynamics, underactuation, and undergo complex dissipative impacts. This paper discusses methods used to overcome a wide variety of uncertainties, with the end result being stable bipedal walking. The principal contribution of this paper is to establish sufficiency conditions for yielding input to state stable (ISS) hybrid periodic orbits, i.e., stable walking gaits under model-based and phase-based uncertainties. In particular, it will be shown formally that exponential input to state stabilization (e-ISS) of the continuous dynamics, and hybrid invariance conditions are enough to realize stable walking in the 23-DOF bipedal robot DURUS. This main result will be supported through successful and sustained walking of the bipedal robot DURUS in a laboratory environment.;math.OC
1801.00621;FKG (and other inequalities) via (generalized) FK representation (and iterated folding);In this paper we prove several inequalities by means of diagrammatic expansions, a technique already used in [BG13]. This time we show that iterations of the folding of a probability leads to the proof of some in- equalities by means of a generalized random cluster representation of the iterated foldings. One of the inequalities is the well known FKG inequal- ity, which ends up being proven, quite unexpectedly, by means of the (generalized) FK representation. Although most of the results are not new, we hope that the techniques will find applications in other contexts.;math.PR
1801.00623;Observability of Boolean Networks via Set Controllability Approach;The controllability and observability of Boolean control network(BCN) are two fundamental properties. But the verification of latter is much harder than the former. This paper considers the observability of BCN via controllability. First, the set controllability is proposed, and the necessary and sufficient condition is obtained. Then a technique is developed to convert the observability into an equivalent set controllability problem. Using the result for set controllability, the necessary and sufficient condition is also obtained for the observability of BCN.;math.OC
1801.00624;Homology of Lie Algebras of Orthogonal and Symplectic Generalized Jacobi Matrices;In this note, we compute the homology with trivial coefficients of Lie algebras of generalized Jacobi matrices of type $B, C$ and $D$ over an associative unital $k$-algebra with $k$ being a field of characteristic $0$.;math.RT
1801.00627;Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse games on a class of scattered linear orders;Two structures $A$ and $B$ are $n$-equivalent if player II has a winning strategy in the $n$-move Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e game on $A$ and $B$. In earlier papers we studied $n$-equivalence classes of ordinals and coloured ordinals. In this paper we similarly treat a class of scattered order-types, focussing on monomials and sums of monomials in $\omega$ and its reverse $\omega^*$.;math.LO
1801.00628;Deformation of the $&#x3c3,_2$-curvature;Our main goal in this work is to deal with results concern to the $\sigma_2$-curvature. First we find a symmetric 2-tensor canonically associated to the $\sigma_2$-curvature and we present an Almost Schur Type Lemma. Using this tensor we introduce the notion of $\sigma_2$-singular space and under a certain hypothesis we prove a rigidity result. Also we deal with the relations between flat metrics and $\sigma_2$-curvature. With a suitable condition on the $\sigma_2$-curvature we show that a metric has to be flat if it is close to a flat metric. We conclude this paper by proving that the 3-dimensional torus does not admit a metric with constant scalar curvature and non-negative $\sigma_2$-curvature unless it is flat.;math.DG
1801.00629;$H^2$--Convergence of least-squares kernel collocation methods;The strong-form asymmetric kernel-based collocation method, commonly referred to as the Kansa method, is easy to implement and hence is widely used for solving engineering problems and partial differential equations despite the lack of theoretical support. The simple least-squares (LS) formulation, on the other hand, makes the study of its solvability and convergence rather nontrivial. In this paper, we focus on general second order linear elliptic differential equations in $\Omega \subset R^d$ under Dirichlet boundary conditions. With kernels that reproduce $H^m(\Omega)$ and some smoothness assumptions on the solution, we provide denseness conditions for a constrained least-squares method and a class of weighted least-squares algorithms to be convergent. Theoretically, we identify some $H^2(\Omega)$ convergent LS formulations that have an optimal error behavior like $h^{m-2}$. We also demonstrate the effects of various collocation settings on the respective convergence rates, as well as how these formulations perform with high order kernels and when coupled with the stable evaluation technique for the Gaussian kernel.;math.NA
1801.00630;A nonstandard invariant of coarse spaces;We construct a set-valued invariant $\iota\left(X,\xi\right)$ of pointed coarse spaces $\left(X,\xi\right)$ by using nonstandard analysis. The invariance under coarse equivalence is established. A sufficient condition for the invariant to be of cardinality $\leq1$ is provided. Miller et al. and subsequent researchers have introduced a similar but standard set-valued coarse invariant $\sigma\left(X,\xi\right)$ of pointed metric spaces $\left(X,\xi\right)$. In order to compare these two invariants, we construct a natural transformation $\omega_{\left(X,\xi\right)}$ from $\sigma\left(X,\xi\right)$ to $\iota\left(X,\xi\right)$. The surjectivity of $\omega_{\left(X,\xi\right)}$ is proved for all proper geodesic spaces $\left(X,\xi\right)$.;math.GN
1801.00633;On semilinear elliptic equations with diffuse measures;We consider semilinear equation of the form $-Lu=f(x,u)+\mu$, where $L$ is the operator corresponding to a transient symmetric regular Dirichlet form ${\mathcal E}$, $\mu$ is a diffuse measure with respect to the capacity associated with ${\mathcal E}$, and the lower-order perturbing term $f(x,u)$ satisfies the sign condition in $u$ and some weak integrability condition (no growth condition on $f(x,u)$ as a function of $u$ is imposed). We prove the existence of a solution under mild additional assumptions on ${\mathcal E}$. We also show that the solution is unique if $f$ is nonincreasing in $u$.;math.AP
1801.00638;Distinguishing pure representations by normalized traces;Given two pure representations of the absolute Galois group of an $\ell$-adic number field with coefficients in $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_p$ (with $\ell\neq p$), we show that the Frobenius-semisimplifications of the associated Weil--Deligne representations are twists of each other by an integral power of certain unramified character if they have equal normalized traces. This is an analogue of a recent result of Patankar and Rajan in the context of local Galois representations.;math.NT
1801.00647;Distributed Control and Stabilization for Discrete-time Large Scale Systems With Imposed Constraints;This paper is concerned with the distributed control and stabilization problems for linear discrete-time large scale systems with imposed constraints. The main contributions of this paper are: Firstly, by using the maximum principle (necessary condition) for the finite horizon optimal control developed in this paper, the optimal distributed controller is thus derived, which can be easily calculated, Secondly, by defining the Lyapunov function with the optimal cost function, we show that the systems with imposed constraints can be stabilized by the optimal distributed controller for the infinite horizon case. The main techniques adopted in this paper are the maximum principle and the solution to the forward and backward difference equations (FBDE), which are the basis in solving distributed control and stabilization problems for linear systems with constraints.;math.OC
1801.00653;Rings which are Essential over their Centers, II;A ring $R$ with center $C$ is said to be\textit{centrally essential} if the module $R_C$ is an essential extension of the module $C_C$. We describe centrally essential exterior algebras of finitely generated free modules over not necessary commutative rings and study properties of semi-Artinian centrally essential rings.

1801.00654;Simple supermodules over Lie superalgebras;We show that, for many Lie superalgebras admitting a compatible $\mathbb{Z}$-grading, Kac induction functor gives rise to a bijection between simple supermodules over a Lie superalgebra and simple supermodules over the even part of this Lie superalgebra. This reduces the classification problem for the former to the one for the latter. Our result applies to all classical Lie superalgebra of type $I$, in particular, to the general linear Lie superalgebra $\gl(m|n)$. In the latter case we also show that the rough structure of simple $\gl(m|n)$-supermodules and also that of Kac supermodules depends only on the annihilator of the $\mf{gl}(m)\oplus \mf{gl}(n)$-input and hence can be computed using the combinatorics of BGG category $\mathcal{O}$.;math.RT
1801.00655;Contractibility of the Space of Opers for Classical Groups;The geometric Langlands program is an exciting direction of research, although a lot of progress has been made there are still open questions and gaps. One of the necessary steps for this program is the proof of the existence and the cohomological triviality (more precisely, the O- contractibility) of the space of rational opers. In this paper, we prove the homotopical contractibility of the space of rational opers for classical groups.;math.RT
1801.00656;On the constant scalar curvature K&#xe4,hler metrics, existence results;In this paper, we generalize our apriori estimates on cscK(constant scalar curvature K\"ahler) metric equation to more general scalar curvature type equations (e.g., twisted cscK metric equation). As applications, under the assumption that the automorphism group is discrete, we prove the celebrated Donaldson's conjecture that the non-existence of cscK metric is equivalent to the existence of a destabilized geodesic ray where the $K$-energy is non-increasing. Moreover, we prove that the properness of $K$-energy in terms of $L^1$ geodesic distance $d_1$ in the space of K\"ahler potentials implies the existence of cscK metric. Finally, we prove that weak minimizers of the $K$-energy in $(\mathcal{E}^1, d_1)$ are smooth.;math.DG
1801.00657;The $p$-adic Lambert $W$ function;In this paper we introduce the $p$-adic analogue of the Lambert $W$ function, and study its main properties.;math.CA
1801.00661;Heat kernels of non-symmetric jump processes with exponentially decaying jumping kernel;In this paper we study the transition densities for a large class of non-symmetric Markov processes whose jumping kernels decay exponentially or subexponentially. We obtain their upper bounds which also decay at the same rate as their jumping kernels. When the lower bounds of jumping kernels satisfy the weak upper scaling condition at zero, we also establish lower bounds for the transition densities, which are sharp.;math.PR
1801.00663;A Sharp Estimate for Probability Distributions;We consider absolutely continuous probability distributions $f(x)dx$ on $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$. A result of Feldheim and Feldheim shows, among other things, that if the distribution is not compactly supported, then there exist $z &gt, 0$ such that most events in $\left\{X + Y \geq 2z\right\}$ are comprised of a 'small' term satisfying $\min(X,Y) \leq z$ and a 'large' term satisfying $\max(X,Y) \geq z$ (as opposed to two 'large' terms that are both larger than $z$) $$ \limsup_{z \rightarrow \infty}~ \mathbb{P}\left( \min(X,Y) \leq z | X+Y \geq 2z\right) = 1.$$ The result fails if the distribution is compactly supported. We prove $$\sup_{z &gt, 0 } ~\mathbb{P}\left( \min(X,Y) \leq z | X+Y \geq 2z\right) \geq \frac{1}{24 + 8\log_2{( med(X) \|f\|_{L^{\infty}})}},$$ where $med(X)$ denotes the median. Interestingly, the logarithm is necessary and the result is sharp up to constants, we also discuss some open problems.;math.PR
1801.00670;Low-Rank Matrix Approximations Do Not Need a Singular Value Gap;This is a systematic investigation into the sensitivity of low-rank approximations of real matrices. We show that the low-rank approximation errors, in the two-norm, Frobenius norm and more generally, any Schatten p-norm, are insensitive to additive rank-preserving perturbations in the projector basis, and to matrix perturbations that are additive or change the number of columns (including multiplicative perturbations). Thus, low-rank matrix approximations are always well-posed and do not require a singular value gap. In the presence of a singular value gap, connections are established between low-rank approximations and subspace angles.;math.NA
1801.00673;CutIGA with Basis Function Removal;We consider a cut isogeometric method, where the boundary of the domain is allowed to cut through the background mesh in an arbitrary fashion for a second order elliptic model problem. In order to stabilize the method on the cut boundary we remove basis functions which have small intersection with the computational domain. We determine criteria on the intersection which guarantee that the order of convergence in the energy norm is not affected by the removal. The higher order regularity of the B-spline basis functions leads to improved bounds compared to standard Lagrange elements.;math.NA
1801.00682;A Probabilistic Subspace Bound with Application to Active Subspaces;Given a real symmetric positive semi-definite matrix E, and an approximation S that is a sum of n independent matrix-valued random variables, we present bounds on the relative error in S due to randomization. The bounds do not depend on the matrix dimensions but only on the numerical rank (intrinsic dimension) of E. Our approach resembles the low-rank approximation of kernel matrices from random features, but our accuracy measures are more stringent. <br />In the context of parameter selection based on active subspaces, where S is computed via Monte Carlo sampling, we present a bound on the number of samples so that with high probability the angle between the dominant subspaces of E and S is less than a user-specified tolerance. This is a substantial improvement over existing work, as it is a non-asymptotic and fully explicit bound on the sampling amount n, and it allows the user to tune the success probability. It also suggests that Monte Carlo sampling can be efficient in the presence of many parameters, as long as the underlying function f is sufficiently smooth.;math.NA
1801.00683;The sequential loss of allelic diversity;This paper gives a new flavor of what Peter Jagers and his co-authors call `the path to extinction'. In a neutral population with constant size $N$, we assume that each individual at time $0$ carries a distinct type, or allele. We consider the joint dynamics of these $N$ alleles, for example the dynamics of their respective frequencies and more plainly the nonincreasing process counting the number of alleles remaining by time $t$. We call this process the extinction process. We show that in the Moran model, the extinction process is distributed as the process counting (in backward time) the number of common ancestors to the whole population, also known as the block counting process of the $N$-Kingman coalescent. Stimulated by this result, we investigate: (1) whether it extends to an identity between the frequencies of blocks in the Kingman coalescent and the frequencies of alleles in the extinction process, both evaluated at jump times, (2) whether it extends to the general case of $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot processes.;math.PR
1801.00684;Risk minimization in life-cycle oil production optimization;The geology of oil reservoirs is largely unknown. Consequently, the reservoir models used for production optimization are subject to significant uncertainty. To minimize the associated risk, the oil literature has mainly used ensemble-based methods to optimize sample estimated risk measures of net present value (NPV). However, the success in reducing risk critically depends on the choice of risk measure. As a systematic approach to risk mitigation in production optimization, this paper characterizes proper risk measures by the axioms of coherence and aversion. As an example of a proper measure, we consider conditional value-at-risk, $\text{CVaR}_{\alpha}$, at different risk levels, $\alpha$. The potential of $\text{CVaR}_{\alpha}$ to minimize profit loss is demonstrated by a simulated case study. The case study compares $\text{CVaR}_{\alpha}$ to real-world best practices, represented by reactive control. It shows that for any risk level, $\alpha$, we may find an optimized strategy that provides lower risk than reactive control. However, despite overall lower risk, we see that all optimized strategies still yield some unacceptable low profit realizations relative to reactive control. To remedy this, we introduce a risk mitigation method based on the NPV offset distribution. Unlike existing methods of the oil literature, the offset risk mitigation approach minimizes the risk relative to a reference strategy representing common real-life practices, e.g. reactive control. In the simulated case study, we minimize the worst case profit offset to reduce the risk of realizations that do worse than the reactive strategy. The results suggest that it may be more relevant to consider the NPV offset distribution than the NPV distribution when minimizing risk in production optimization.;math.OC
1801.00691;Energy-enstrophy conserving compatible finite element schemes for the rotating shallow water equations with slip boundary conditions;We describe an energy-enstrophy conserving discretisation for the rotating shallow water equations with slip boundary conditions. This relaxes the assumption of boundary-free domains (periodic solutions or the surface of a sphere, for example) in the energy-enstrophy conserving formulation of McRae and Cotter (2014). This discretisation requires extra prognostic vorticity variables on the boundary in addition to the prognostic velocity and layer depth variables. The energy-enstrophy conservation properties hold for any appropriate set of compatible finite element spaces defined on arbitrary meshes with arbitrary boundaries. We demonstrate the conservation properties of the scheme with numerical solutions on a rotating hemisphere.;math.NA
1801.00696;On pairs of interacting electrons in a quantum wire;In this paper we consider pairs of interacting electrons moving in a simple quantum wire, namely the half-line. In particular, we extend the results obtained in [<a href="/abs/1708.03753">arXiv:1708.03753</a>] by allowing for contact interactions of the Lieb-Liniger type between the two electrons constituting the pair. We construct the associated Hamiltonian rigorously and study its spectral properties. We then investigate Bose-Einstein condensation of pairs and prove, as a main result, the existence of condensation whenever the Hamiltonian has a non-trivial discrete spectrum. Most importantly, condensation is proved for very weak and very strong contact interactions.;math-ph
1801.00699;Sandwich classification for $O_{2n+1}(R)$ and $U_{2n+1}(R,&#x394,)$ revisited;In a recent paper, the author proved that if $n\geq 3$ is a natural number, $R$ a commutative ring and $\sigma\in GL_n(R)$, then $t_{kl}(\sigma_{ij})$ where $i\neq j$ and $k\neq l$ can be expressed as a product of $8$ matrices of the form $^{\epsilon}\sigma^{\pm 1}$ where $\epsilon\in E_n(R)$. In this article we prove similar results for the odd-dimensional orthogonal groups $O_{2n+1}(R)$ and the odd-dimensional unitary groups $U_{2n+1}(R,\Delta)$ under the assumption that $R$ is commutative and $n\geq 3$. This yields new, short proofs of the Sandwich Classification Theorems for the groups $O_{2n+1}(R)$ and $U_{2n+1}(R,\Delta)$.;math.KT
1801.00700;Nests, and their Role in the Orderability Problem;This chapter is divided into two parts. The first part is a survey of some recent results on nests and the orderability problem. The second part consists of results, partial results and open questions, all viewed in the light of nests. From connected LOTS, to products of LOTS and function spaces, up to an order relation in the Fermat Real Line.;math.GN
1801.00706;A new representation of Hankel operators and its spectral consequences;We describe a new representation of Hankel operators $H$ as pseudo-differential operators $A$ in the space of functions defined on the whole axis. The amplitudes of such operators $A$ have a very special structure: they are products of functions of a one variable only. This representation has numerous spectral consequences both for compact Hankel operators and for operators with the continuous spectrum.;math.SP
1801.00709;Cluster algebras arising from cluster tubes I: integer vectors;We study cluster algebras arising from cluster tubes. We obtain categorical interpretations for $g$-vectors, $c$-vectors and denominator vectors for cluster algebras of type $\mathrm{C}$ with respect to arbitrary initial seeds. In particular, a denominator theorem has been proved, which enables us to establish the linearly independence of denominator vectors of cluster variables from the same cluster for cluster algebras of type $\mathrm{A}\mathrm{B}\mathrm{C}$. This strengthens the link between cluster tubes and cluster algebras of type $\mathrm{C}$ initiated by Buan, Marsh and Vatne.;math.RA
1801.00714;Exact Exponent for Soft Covering;This work establishes the exact exponents for the soft-covering phenomenon of a memoryless channel under the total variation metric when random (i.i.d. and constant-composition) channel codes are used. The exponents, established herein, are strict improvements in both directions on bounds found in the literature. This complements the recent literature establishing the exact exponents under the relative entropy metric, however, the proof techniques have significant differences, and thus, neither result trivially implies the other. <br />The found exponents imply new and improved bounds for various problems that use soft-covering as their achievability argument, including new lower bounds for the resolvability exponent and the secrecy exponent in the wiretap channel.;cs.IT
1801.00721;A crossing lemma for multigraphs;Let $G$ be a drawing of a graph with $n$ vertices and $e&gt,4n$ edges, in which no two adjacent edges cross and any pair of independent edges cross at most once. According to the celebrated Crossing Lemma of Ajtai, Chv\'atal, Newborn, Szemer\'edi and Leighton, the number of crossings in $G$ is at least $c{e^3\over n^2}$, for a suitable constant $c&gt,0$. In a seminal paper, Sz\'ekely generalized this result to multigraphs, establishing the lower bound $c{e^3\over mn^2}$, where $m$ denotes the maximum multiplicity of an edge in $G$. We get rid of the dependence on $m$ by showing that, as in the original Crossing Lemma, the number of crossings is at least $c'{e^3\over n^2}$ for some $c'&gt,0$, provided that the "lens" enclosed by every pair of parallel edges in $G$ contains at least one vertex. This settles a conjecture of Kaufmann.;math.CO
1801.00722;Bases for Kumjian-Pask algebras over standard $k$-graphs;For any Kumjian-Pask algebra $KP_R(\Lambda)$ defined over a $k$-graph $\Lambda$ of a special kind (a "standard $k$-graph"), we obtain an $R$-basis.;math.KT
1801.00724;Subdifferential formulae for the supremum of an arbitrary family of functions;This work provides calculus for the Fr\'echet and limiting subdifferential of the pointwise supremum given by an arbitrary family of lower semicontinuous functions. We start our study showing fuzzy results about the Fr\'echet subdifferential of the supremum function. Posteriorly, we study in finite- and infinite-dimensional settings the limiting subdifferential of the supremum function. Finally, we apply our results to the study of the convex subdifferential, here we recover general formulae for the subdifferential of an arbitrary family of convex functions.;math.OC
1801.00726;Forcing Brushes;We give short and simple proofs of the inequalities $B(G)\leq Z(L(G))$ and $Z(G)\leq Z(L(G))$ first established by Erzurumluo\u{g}lu, Meagher, and Pike, where $G$ is a graph without isolated vertices, $B(G)$ is the brushing number of $G$, $Z(G)$ is the zero forcing number of $G$, and $L(G)$ is the line graph of $G$.;math.CO
1801.00728;Integration of quadratic Lie algebroids to Riemannian Cartan-Lie groupoids;Cartan-Lie algebroids, i.e. Lie algebroids equipped with a compatible connection, permit the definition of an adjoint representation, on the fiber as well as on the tangent of the base. We call (positive) quadratic Lie algebroids, Cartan-Lie algebroids with ad-invariant (Riemannian) metrics on their fibers and base $\kappa$ and $g$, respectively. We determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for a positive quadratic Lie algebroid to integrate to a Riemmanian Cartan-Lie groupoid. Here we mean a Cartan-Lie groupoid $\mathcal{G}$ equipped with a bi-invariant and inversion invariant metric $\eta$ on $T\mathcal{G}$ such that it induces by submersion the metric $g$ on its base and its restriction to the $t$-fibers coincides with $\kappa$.;math.DG
1801.00733;The bicanonical map of the Cartwright-Steger surface;We prove that the bicanonical map of the Cartwright-Steger surface is an embedding. We also discuss two minimal surfaces of general type, both covered by the Cartwright-Steger surface. One has $K^2=2$, $p_g=1$, $\pi_1=\{1\}$ and the other has $K^2=1$, $p_g=0$, $\pi_1=\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$.;math.AG
1801.00735;Filtered finiteness of the image of the unstable Hurewicz homomorphism with applications to bordism of immersions;After recent work of Hill, Hopkins, and Ravenel on the Kervaire invariant one problem, as well as Adams' solution of the Hopf invariant one problem, an immediate consequence of Curtis conjecture is that the set of spherical classes in $H_*Q_0S^0$ is finite. Similarly, Eccles conjecture, when specialised to $X=S^n$ with $n&gt,0$, together with Adams' Hopf invariant one theorem, implies that the set of spherical classes in $H_*QS^n$ is finite. We prove a filtered version of the above the finiteness properties. We show that if $X$ is an arbitrary $CW$-complex such that $H_*X$ is finite dimensional then the image of the composition ${_2\pi_*}\Omega^l\Sigma^{l+2}X\to{_2\pi_*}Q\Sigma^2X\to H_*Q\Sigma^2X$ is finite, the finiteness remains valid if we formally replace $X$ with $S^{-1}$. As an immediate and interesting application, we observe that for any compact Lie group $G$ with $\dim\mathfrak{g}&gt,1$ and for any $n&gt,0$ the image of the composition ${_2\pi_*}Q\Sigma^{\dim\mathfrak{g}}BG_+^{[n]}\to{_2\pi_*}Q\Sigma^{\dim\mathfrak{g}}BG_+\to {_2\pi_*}Q_0S^0\to H_*Q_0S^0$ is finite where $\Sigma^{\dim\mathfrak{g}}BG_+\to S^0$ is a suitably twisted transfer map. Next, we consider work of Koschorke and Sanderson which using Thom-Pontrjagin construction provides a $1$-$1$ correspondence (a group isomorphism if $m+d&gt,0$) $\Phi^{N,\xi}_{m,d}: \mathrm{Imm}_\xi^d(\mathbb{R}^m\times N) \longrightarrow [N_+,\Omega^{m+d}\Sigma^dT(\xi)]$. We apply work of Asadi and Eccles on computing Stiefel-Whitney numbers of immersions to show that given a framed immersion $M\to\mathbb{R}^{n+k}$ and choosing $n$ very large with respect to $d$ and $k$, all self-intersection manifolds of an arbitrary element of $\mathrm{Imm}_\xi^d(\mathbb{R}^m\times N)$ are boundary.;math.AT
1801.00737;Even cycle creating paths;We say that two graphs $H_1,H_2$ on the same vertex set are $G$-creating ($G$-different in other papers, this difference is explained in the introduction) if the union of the two graphs contains $G$ as a subgraph. Let $H(n,k)$ be the maximal number of pairwise $C_k$-creating paths (of arbitrary length) on $n$ vertices. The behaviour of $H(n,2k+1)$ is much better understood than the behaviour of $H(n,2k)$, the former is an exponential function of $n$ while the latter is larger than exponential, for every fixed $k$. We study $H(n,k)$ for fixed $k$ and $n$ tending to infinity. The only non trivial upper bound on $H(n,2k)$ was in the case where $k=2$ $$H(n,4)\leq n^{\left(1-\frac{1}{4} \right) n-o(n)}, $$ this was proved by Cohen, Fachini and K\"orner. In this paper, we generalize their method to prove that for every $k \geq 2$, <br />$$H(n,2k) \leq n^{\left( 1- \frac{2}{3k^2-2k} \right)n-o(n)}. $$ Our proof uses constructions of bipartite, regular, $C_{2k}$-free graphs with many edges by Reiman, Benson, Lazebnik, Ustimenko and Woldar. For some special values of $k$ we can have slightly denser such bipartite graphs than for general $k$, this results in having better upper bounds on $H(n,2k)$ than stated above for these special values of $k$.;math.CO
1801.00739;Log canonical pairs over varieties with maximal Albanese dimension;Let $(X,B)$ be a log canonical pair over a normal variety $Z$ with maximal Albanese dimension. If $K_X+B$ is relatively abundant over $Z$ (for example, $K_X+B$ is relatively big over $Z$), then we prove that $K_X+B$ is abundant. In particular, the subadditvity of Kodaira dimensions $\kappa(K_X+B) \geq \kappa(K_F+B_F)+ \kappa(Z)$ holds, where $F$ is a general fiber, $K_F+B_F= (K_X+B)|_F$, and $\kappa(Z)$ means the Kodaira dimension of a smooth model of $Z$. We discuss several variants of this result in Section 4. We also give a remark on the log Iitaka conjecture for log canonical pairs in Section 5.;math.AG
1801.00741;Mixed Boundary Value Problems for non-Divergence Type Elliptic Equations in Unbounded Domain;We investigate the qualitative properties of solution to the Zaremba type problem in unbounded domain for the non-divergence elliptic equation with possible degeneration at infinity. The main result is Phragm\'en-Lindel\"of type principle on growth/decay of a solution at infinity depending on both the structure of the Neumann portion of the boundary and the "thickness" of its Dirichlet portion. The result is formulated in terms of so-called $s$-capacity of the Dirichlet portion of the boundary, while the Neumann boundary should satisfy certain "admissibility" condition in the sequence of layers converging to infinity.;math.AP
1801.00749;Simplicial faces of the set of correlation matrices;This paper concerns the facial geometry of the set of $n \times n$ correlation matrices. The main result states that almost every set of $r$ vertices generates a simplicial face, provided that $r \leq \sqrt{\mathrm{c} n}$, where $\mathrm{c}$ is an absolute constant. This bound is qualitatively sharp because the set of correlation matrices has no simplicial face generated by more than $\sqrt{2n}$ vertices.;math.MG
1801.00754;Fundamental Latency Limits for D2D-Aided Content Delivery in Fog Wireless Networks;Device-to-Device (D2D) communication can support the operation of cellular systems by reducing the traffic in the network infrastructure. In this paper, the benefits of D2D communication are investigated in the context of a Fog-Radio Access Network (F-RAN) that leverages edge caching and fronthaul connectivity for the purpose of content delivery. Assuming offline caching, out-of-band D2D communication, and an F-RAN with two edge nodes and two user equipments, an information-theoretically optimal caching and delivery strategy is presented that minimizes the delivery time in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. The delivery time accounts for the latency caused by fronthaul, downlink, and D2D transmissions. The proposed optimal strategy is based on a novel scheme for an X-channel with receiver cooperation that leverages tools from real interference alignment. Insights are provided on the regimes in which D2D communication is beneficial.;cs.IT
1801.00757;The second Weyl coefficient for a first order system;For a scalar elliptic self-adjoint operator on a compact manifold without boundary we have two-term asymptotics for the number of eigenvalues between zero and lambda when lambda tends to infinity, under an additional dynamical condition. This is a well known result of J.J.Duistermaat and V.W.Guillemin from 1975. <br />In the case of an elliptic system of first order, the existence of two-term asymptotics was also established quite early and as in the scalar case Fourier integral operators have been the crucial tool. The complete computation of the coefficient of the second term was obtained only in 2013. In the present paper we simplify that calculation. The main observation is that with the existence of two-term asymptotics already established, it suffices to study the resolvent as a pseudodifferential operator in order to identify and compute the second coefficient.;math.SP
1801.00760;The cover time of a biased random walk on a random cubic graph;We study a random walk that prefers tou se unvisited edges in the context of random cubic graphs. We establish asymptotically correct estimates for the vertex and edge cover times, these being $\approx n\log n$ and $\approx \frac32n\log n$ respectively.;math.CO
1801.00761;Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with singular drifts: integral estimates and Girsanov densities;We consider a perturbation of a Hilbert space-valued Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process by a class of singular nonlinear non-autonomous maximal monotone time-dependent drifts. The only further assumption on the drift is that it is bounded on balls in the Hilbert space uniformly in time. First we introduce a new notion of generalized solutions for such equations which we call pseudo-weak solutions and prove that they always exist and obtain pathwise estimates in terms of the data of the equation. Then we prove that their laws are absolutely continuous with respect to the law of the original Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process. In particular, we show that pseudo-weak solutions always have continuous sample paths. In addition, we obtain integrability estimates of the associated Girsanov densities. Some of our results concern non-random equations as well, while probabilistic results are new even in finite-dimensional autonomous settings.;math.PR
1801.00763;Koszul almost complete intersections;Let $R = S/I$ be a quotient of a standard graded polynomial ring $S$ by an ideal $I$ generated by quadrics. If $R$ is Koszul, a question of Avramov, Conca, and Iyengar asks whether the Betti numbers of $R$ over $S$ can be bounded above by binomial coefficients on the minimal number of generators of $I$. Motivated by previous results for Koszul algebras defined by three quadrics, we give a complete classification of the structure of Koszul almost complete intersections and, in the process, give an affirmative answer to the above question for all such rings.;math.AC
1801.00767;The local-triviality dimension of actions of compact quantum groups;We define the local-triviality dimension for actions of compact quantum groups on unital C*-algebras. The resulting compact quantum principal bundle is said to be locally trivial when this dimension is finite. For commutative C*-algebras, this notion recovers the standard definition of local triviality of compact principal bundles. We prove that actions with finite local-triviality dimension are automatically free. Then we apply this new notion to prove the noncommutative Borsuk-Ulam-type conjecture under the assumption that a compact quantum group admits a non-trivial classical subgroup whose induced action has finite local-triviality dimension. This is a noncommutative extension of the Borsuk-Ulam-type theorem for locally trivial principal bundles.;math.OA
1801.00770;The set of non-uniquely ergodic d-IETs has Hausdorff codimension 1/2;We show that the set of not uniquely ergodic d-IETs has Hausdorff dimension d-3/2 (in the (d-1)-dimension space of d-IETs) for d&gt,4. For d=4 this was shown by Athreya-Chaika and for d=2,3 the set is known to have dimension d-2.;math.DS
1801.00771;A note on logarithmic growth of solutions of $p$-adic differential equations without solvability;For a $p$-adic differential equation solvable in an open disc (in a $p$-adic sense), around 1970, Dwork proves that the solutions satisfy a certain growth condition on the boundary. Dwork also conjectures that a similar phenomenon should be observed without assuming the solvability. In this paper, we verify Dwork's conjecture in the rank two case, which is the first non-trivial result on the conjecture. The proof is an application of Kedlaya's decomposition theorem of $p$-adic differential equations defined over annulus.;math.NT
1801.00780;A Mathematical Analysis of Dirac Equation Physics;The paper analyzes time propagation of Dirac observables - using Heisenberg representation - in the light of various pseudodifferential operator algebras (cf. [Co3], [Co15], [Co16]). Our theory gives (i) a mechanical angular momentum (the spin), but also (ii) another real 3-vector, travelling with the particle, with magnetic properties (its motion guided by the magnetic field around it, but not in the proper relativistic way). The above is discussed for potentials vanishing at infinity. But we also look at a Dirac particle in the field of a plane polarized X-ray wave, trying to analyze the Compton effect. The propagations of energy and momentum (in the X-ray's direction) are coupled - they allow a joint asymptotic expansion with terms representing change of energy by $nh\nu$ and momentum by $nh\nu/c$, with n=0,1,2, ..., valid for large frequencies, i.e., large momentum coordinates. Possible interpretation: A collision of the electron-positron with 0, 1, 2, ... n Photons of energy $h\nu$, affecting a change of energy-momentum. Note, this does not require QFT.;math-ph
1801.00781;Gibbs measures of an Ising model with competing interactions on the triangular chandelier-lattice;In this paper, we consider an Ising model with three competing interactions on a triangular chandelier-lattice (TCL). We describe the existence, uniqueness, and non-uniqueness of translation-invariant Gibbs measures associated with the Ising model. We obtain an explicit formula for Gibbs measures with a memory of length 2 satisfying consistency conditions. It is rigorously proved that the model exhibits phase transitions only for given values of the coupling constants. As a consequence of our approach, the dichotomy between alternative solutions of Hamiltonian models on TCLs is solved. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.;math-ph
1801.00782;Trapezoidal type inequalities related to h-convex functions with applications;A mapping M(t) is considered to obtain some preliminary results and a new trapezoidal form of Fejer inequality related to the h-convex functions. Furthermore the obtained results are applied to achieve some new inequalities in connection with special means, random variable and trapezoidal formula.;math.FA
1801.00784;Expansion of Iterated Stratonovich Stochastic Integrals of Arbitrary Multiplicity Based on Generalized Iterated Fourier Series Converging Pointwise;The article is devoted to the expansion of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of arbitrary multiplicity $k$ $(k\in\mathbb{N})$ based on the generalized iterated Fourier series converging pointwise. The case of Fourier-Legendre series as well as the case of trigonometric Fourier series are considered in details. The obtained expansion provides a possibility to represent the iterated Stratonovich stochastic integral in the form of iterated series of products of standard Gaussian random variables. Convergence in the mean of degree $2n$ $(n\in \mathbb{N})$ of the expansion is proved. Some modifications of the mentioned expansion were derived for the case $k=2$. One of them is based of multiple trigonometric Fourier series converging almost everywhere in the square $[t, T]^2$. The results of the article can be applied to the numerical solution of Ito stochastic differential equations.;math.PR
1801.00785;Geometric presentation for the cohomology ring of polygon spaces;We describe the cohomology ring of the moduli space of a flexible polygon in geometrically meaningful terms. We propose two presentations, both are computation friendly: there are simple rules for cup product.;math.GT
1801.00803;On full Zakharov equation and its approximations;We study the solvability of the Zakharov equation $$\Delta^2 u + (\kappa-\omega^2)\Delta u - \kappa \,\text{div} \left(e^{-|\nabla u|^2} \nabla u\right) = 0$$ in a bounded domain under homogeneous Dirichlet or Navier boundary conditions. This problem is a consequence of the system of equations derived by Zakharov to model the Langmuir collapse in plasma physics. Assumptions for the existence and nonexistence of a ground state solution as well as the multiplicity of solutions are discussed. Moreover, we consider formal approximations of the Zakharov equation obtained by the Taylor expansion of the exponential term. We illustrate that the existence and nonexistence results are substantially different from the corresponding results for the original problem.;math.AP
1801.00812;Limit shapes for Gibbs ensembles of partitions;We explicitly compute limit shapes for several grand canonical Gibbs ensembles of partitions of integers. These ensembles appear in models of aggregation and are also related to invariant measures of zero range and coagulation-fragmentation processes. We show, that all possible limit shapes for these ensembles fall into several distinct classes determined by the asymptotics of the internal energies of aggregates.;math-ph
1801.00813;Force appropriation of nonlinear structures;Nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) are widely used as a tool for developing mathematical models of nonlinear structures and understanding their dynamics. NNMs can be identified experimentally through a phase quadrature condition between the system response and the applied excitation. This paper demonstrates that this commonly-used quadrature condition can give results that are significantly different from the true NNM, in particular when the excitation applied to the system is limited to one input force, as is frequently used in practice. The system studied is a clamped-clamped cross beam with two closely-spaced modes. This paper shows that the regions where the quadrature condition is (in)accurate can be qualitatively captured by analysing transfer of energy between the modes of the system, leading to a discussion of the appropriate number of input forces and their locations across the structure.;math.DS
1801.00819;Block row recursive least squares migration;Recursive estimates of large systems of equations in the context of least squares fitting is a common practice in different fields of study. For example, recursive adaptive filtering is extensively used in signal processing and control applications. The necessity of solving least squares problem via recursive algorithms comes from the need of fast real-time signal processing strategies. Computational cost of using least squares algorithm could also limits the applicability of this technique in geophysical problems. In this paper, we consider recursive least squares solution for wave equation least squares migration with sliding windows involving several rank K downdating and updating computations. This technique can be applied for dynamic and stationary processes. One can show that in the case of stationary processes, the spectrum of the preconditioned system is clustered around one and the method will converge superlinearly with probability one, if we use enough data in each windowed setup. Numerical experiments are reported in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the technique for least squares migration.;math.NA
1801.00827;Computing images of polynomial maps;The image of a polynomial map is a constructible set. While computing its closure is standard in computer algebra systems, a procedure for computing the constructible set itself is not. We provide a new algorithm, based on algebro-geometric techniques, addressing this problem. We also apply these methods to answer a question of W. Hackbusch on the non-closedness of site-independent cyclic matrix product states for infinitely many parameters.;math.AG
1801.00828;Extrapolation for the $L^p$ Dirichlet Problem in Lipschitz domains;Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a second-order linear elliptic operator with complex coefficients. We show that if the $L^p$ Dirichlet problem for the elliptic system $\mathcal{L}(u)=0$ in a fixed Lipschitz domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is solvable for some $1&lt,p=p_0&lt, \frac{2(d-1)}{d-2}$, then it is solvable for all $p$ satisfying $$ p_0&lt,p&lt, \frac{2(d-1)}{d-2} +\varepsilon. $$ The proof is based on a real-variable argument. It only requires that local solutions of $\mathcal{L}(u)=0$ satisfy a boundary Cacciopoli inequality.;math.AP
1801.00832;The Dixmier-Douady Classes of Certain Groupoid $C^*$-Algebras with Continuous Trace;Given a locally compact abelian group $G$, we give an explicit formula for the Dixmier--Douady invariant of the $C^*$-algebra of the groupoid extension associated to a \v{C}ech $2$-cocycle in the sheaf of germs of continuous $G$-valued functions. We then exploit the blow-up construction for groupoids to extend this to some more general central extensions of \'etale equivalence relations.;math.OA
1801.00836;Asymptotic models for transport in large aspect ratio nanopores;Ion flow in charged nanopores is strongly influenced by the ratio of the Debye length to the pore radius. We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) system in narrow pore like geometries and study the influence of the pore geometry and surface charge on ion transport. The physical properties of real pores motivate the investigation of distinguished asymptotic limits, in which either the Debye length and pore radius are comparable or the pore length is very much greater than its radius. This results in a Quasi-1D PNP model which can be further simplified, in the physically relevant limit of strong pore wall surface charge, to a fully one-dimensional model. Favourable comparison is made to the two-dimensional PNP equations in typical pore geometries. It is also shown that, for physically realistic parameters, the standard 1D Area Averaged PNP model for ion flow through a pore is a very poor approximation to the (real) two-dimensional solution to the PNP equations. This leads us to propose that the Quasi-1D PNP model derived here, whose computational cost is significantly less than two-dimensional solution of the PNP equations, should replace the use of the 1D Area Averaged PNP equations as a tool to investigate ion and current flows in ion pores.;math.AP
1801.00838;Differential equations in automorphic forms;Physicists such as Green, Vanhove, et al show that differential equations involving automorphic forms govern the behavior of gravitons. One particular point of interest is solutions to $(\Delta-\lambda)u=E_{\alpha} E_{\beta}$ on an arithmetic quotient of the exceptional group $E_8$. We establish that the existence of a solution to $(\Delta-\lambda)u=E_{\alpha}E_{\beta}$ on the simpler space $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})\backslash SL_2(\mathbb{R})$ for certain values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ depends on nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$. Further, when such a solution exists, we use spectral theory to solve $(\Delta-\lambda)u=E_{\alpha}E_{\beta}$ on $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})\backslash SL_2(\mathbb{R})$ and provide proof of the meromorphic continuation of the solution. The construction of such a solution uses Arthur truncation, the Maass-Selberg formula, and automorphic Sobolev spaces.;math.NT
1801.00846;Linear iterative schemes for doubly degenerate parabolic equations;Mathematical models for flow and reactive transport in porous media often involve non-linear, degenerate parabolic equations. Their solutions have low regularity, and therefore lower order schemes are used for the numerical approximation. Here the backward Euler method is combined with a mixed finite element method scheme, which results in a stable and locally mass-conservative scheme. At the same time, at each time step one has to solve a non-linear algebraic system, for which linear iterations are needed. Finding robust and convergent ones is particularly challenging here, since both slow and fast diffusion cases are allowed. <br />Commonly used schemes, like Newton and Picard iterations, are defined either for non-degenerate problems, or after regularising the problem in the case of degenerate ones. Convergence is guaranteed only if the initial guess is sufficiently close to the solution, which translates into severe restrictions on the time step. Here we discuss a linear iterative scheme which builds on the $L$-scheme, and does not employ any regularisation. We prove its rigourous convergence, which is obtained for mild restrictions on the time step. Finally, we give numerical results confirming the theoretical ones, and compare the behaviour of the scheme with other schemes.;math.NA
1801.00847;Analysis of Hierarchical Ensemble Kalman Inversion;We discuss properties of hierarchical Bayesian inversion through the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Our focus will be primarily on deriving continuous-time limits for hierarchical inversion in the linear case. An important characteristic of the EnKF for inverse problems is that the updated particles are preserved by the linear span of the initial ensemble. By incorporating certain hierarchical approaches we show that we can break away from the induced subspace property. We further consider a number of variants of the EnKF such as covariance inflation and localization, where we derive their continuous-time limits. We verify these results with various numerical experiments through a linear elliptic partial differential equation.;math.NA
1801.00852;A Concentration Result of Estimating Phi-Divergence using Data Dependent Partition;Estimation of the $\phi$-divergence between two unknown probability distributions using empirical data is a fundamental problem in information theory and statistical learning. We consider a multi-variate generalization of the data dependent partitioning method for estimating divergence between the two unknown distributions. Under the assumption that the distribution satisfies a power law of decay, we provide a convergence rate result for this method on the number of samples and hyper-rectangles required to ensure the estimation error is bounded by a given level with a given probability.;math.PR
1801.00856;Phylogenetic trees and homomorphisms;In Chapter 1 we fully characterise pairs of finite graphs which form a gap in the full homomorphism order. This leads to a simple proof of the existence of generalised duality pairs. We also discuss how such results can be carried to relational structures with unary and binary relations. In Chapter 2 we show a very simple and versatile argument based on divisibility which immediately yields the universality of the homomorphism order of directed graphs and discuss three applications. In chapter 3, we show that every interval in the homomorphism order of finite undirected graphs is either universal or a gap. Together with density and universality this "fractal" property contributes to the spectacular properties of the homomorphism order. In Chapter 4 we analyze the phylogenetic information content from a combinatorial point of view by considering the binary relation on the set of taxa defined by the existence of a single event separating two taxa. We show that the graph-representation of this relation must be a tree. Moreover, we characterize completely the relationship between the tree of such relations and the underlying phylogenetic tree.;math.CO
1801.00869;On properties of Bourgeois contact structures;The Bourgeois construction associates to every contact open book on a manifold $V$ a contact structure on $V\times T^2$. We study in this article some of the properties of $V$ that are inherited by $V\times T^2$ and some that are not. <br />Giroux has provided recently a suitable framework to work with contact open books. In the appendix of this article, we quickly review this formalism, and we work out a few classical examples of contact open books to illustrate how to use this new language.;math.SG
1801.00871;Frobenius Reciprocity for Topological Groups;We investigate the existence of left and right adjoints to the restriction functor in three categories of continuous representations of a topological group: discrete, linear complete and compact.;math.RT
1801.00872;On the integral Hodge conjecture for real varieties, I;We formulate the "real integral Hodge conjecture", a version of the integral Hodge conjecture for real varieties, and raise the question of its validity for cycles of dimension 1 on uniruled and Calabi-Yau threefolds and on rationally connected varieties. We relate it to the problem of determining the image of the Borel-Haefliger cycle class map for 1-cycles, with the problem of deciding whether a real variety with no real point contains a curve of even geometric genus and with the problem of computing the torsion of the Chow group of 1-cycles of real threefolds. New results about these problems are obtained along the way.;math.AG
1801.00873;On the integral Hodge conjecture for real varieties, II;We establish the real integral Hodge conjecture for 1-cycles on various classes of uniruled threefolds (conic bundles, Fano threefolds with no real point, some del Pezzo fibrations) and on conic bundles over higher-dimensional bases which themselves satisfy the real integral Hodge conjecture for 1-cycles. In addition, we show that rationally connected threefolds over non-archimedean real closed fields do not satisfy the real integral Hodge conjecture in general and that over such fields, Br\"ocker's EPT theorem remains true for simply connected surfaces of geometric genus zero but fails for some K3 surfaces.;math.AG
1801.00875;On the growth of the number of totally geodesic surfaces in some hyperbolic $3$-manifolds;Let $d$ be a positive square-free integer $\equiv 3 \pmod{4}$ such that there is no invariant of the ideal class group $\mathbb{Q}\lbrack \sqrt{-d}\rbrack$ which is divisible by $4$. We prove an asymptotic formula for the number of immersed totally geodesic surfaces in $\Gamma_{-d}\backslash \mathbb{H}^3$ having area less than $X$.;math.NT
1801.00876;Eigenvalues of random lifts and polynomials of random permutation matrices;Consider a finite sequence of independent random permutations, chosen uniformly either among all permutations or among all matchings on n points. We show that, in probability, as n goes to infinity, these permutations viewed as operators on the (n-1) dimensional vector space orthogonal to the vector with all coordinates equal to 1, are asymptotically strongly free. Our proof relies on the development of a matrix version of the non-backtracking operator theory and a refined trace method. <br />As a byproduct, we show that the non-trivial eigenvalues of random n-lifts of a fixed based graphs approximately achieve the Alon-Boppana bound with high probability in the large n limit. This result generalizes Friedman's Theorem stating that with high probability, the Schreier graph generated by a finite number of independent random permutations is close to Ramanujan. <br />Finally, we extend our results to tensor products of random permutation matrices. This extension is especially relevant in the context of quantum expanders.;math.PR
1801.00878;Moment bounds of a class of stochastic heat equations driven by space-time colored noise in bounded domains;We consider the fractional stochastic heat type equation <br />\begin{align*} <br />\frac{\partial}{\partial t} u_t(x)=-(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}u_t(x)+\xi\sigma(u_t(x))\dot{F}(t,x),\ \ \ x\in D, \ \ t&gt,0, <br />\end{align*} <br />with nonnegative bounded initial condition, where $\alpha\in (0,2]$, $\xi&gt,0$ is the noise level, $\sigma:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a globally Lipschitz function satisfying some growth conditions and the noise term behaves in space like the Riez kernel and is possibly correlated in time and $D$ is the unit open ball centered at the origin in $\mathbb{R}^d$. When the noise term is not correlated in time, we establish a change in the growth of the solution of these equations depending on the noise level $\xi$. On the other hand when the noise term behaves in time like the fractional Brownian motion with index $H\in (1/2,1)$, We also derive explicit bounds leading to a well-known intermittency property.;math.PR
1801.00884;Structure-Preserving &#x393,QR and &#x393,-Lanczos Algorithms for Bethe-Salpeter Eigenvalue Problems;To solve the Bethe-Salpeter eigenvalue problem with distinct sizes, two efficient methods, called {\Gamma}QR algorithm and {\Gamma}-Lanczos algorithm, are proposed in this paper. Both algorithms preserve the special structure of the initial matrix $H=\begin{bmatrix}A &amp, B-\overline{B} &amp, -\overline{A}\end{bmatrix}$, resulting the computed eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors still hold the properties similar to those of $H$. Theorems are given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed two algorithms in theory. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the superiorities of our methods.;math.NA
1801.00889;A Note on the Lipschitz Selection;We present an alternate proof of the passage from the finiteness principle for metric trees to the construction of the core in the C. Fefferman and Shvartsman finiteness theorem for Lipschitz selection problems.;math.FA
1801.00893;Reliable OFDM Receiver with Ultra-Low Resolution ADC;The use of low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) can significantly reduce power consumption and hardware cost. However, their resulting severe nonlinear distortion makes reliable data transmission challenging. For orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission, the orthogonality among subcarriers is destroyed. This invalidates conventional OFDM receivers relying heavily on this orthogonality. In this study, we move on to quantized OFDM (Q-OFDM) prototyping implementation based on our previous achievement in optimal Q-OFDM detection. First, we propose a novel Q-OFDM channel estimator by extending the generalized Turbo (GTurbo) framework formerly applied for optimal detection. Specifically, we integrate a type of robust linear OFDM channel estimator into the original GTurbo framework and derive its corresponding extrinsic information to guarantee its convergence. We also propose feasible schemes for automatic gain control, noise power estimation, and synchronization. Combined with the proposed inference algorithms, we develop an efficient Q-OFDM receiver architecture. Furthermore, we construct a proof-of-concept prototyping system and conduct over-the-air (OTA) experiments to examine its feasibility and reliability. This is the first work that focuses on both algorithm design and system implementation in the field of low-resolution quantization communication. The results of the numerical simulation and OTA experiment demonstrate that reliable data transmission can be achieved.;cs.IT
1801.00896;Parity sheaves and the Hecke category;The Hecke category is emerging as a fundamental object in representation theory. We give a motivated introduction to this category in both its geometric (via parity sheaves) and diagrammatic (generators and relations) incarnations. We also discuss the p-canonical basis and Koszul duality for the Hecke category.;math.RT
1801.00898;Differential Geometry for Model Independent Analysis of Images and Other Non-Euclidean Data: Recent Developments;This article provides an exposition of recent methodologies for nonparametric analysis of digital observations on images and other non-Euclidean objects. Fr\'echet means of distributions on metric spaces, such as manifolds and stratified spaces, have played an important role in this endeavor. Apart from theoretical issues of uniqueness of the Fr\'echet minimizer and the asymptotic distribution of the sample Fr\'echet mean under uniqueness, applications to image analysis are highlighted. In addition, nonparametric Bayes theory is brought to bear on the problems of density estimation and classification on manifolds.;math.ST
1801.00900;Doubling algorithm for the discretized Bethe-Salpeter eigenvalue problem;The discretized Bethe-Salpeter eigenvalue problem arises in the Green's function evaluation in many body physics and quantum chemistry. Discretization leads to a matrix eigenvalue problem for $H \in \mathbb{C}^{2n\times 2n}$ with a Hamiltonian-like structure. After an appropriate transformation of $H$ to a standard symplectic form, the structure-preserving doubling algorithm, originally for algebraic Riccati equations, is extended for the discretized Bethe-Salpeter eigenvalue problem. Potential breakdowns of the algorithm, due to the ill condition or singularity of certain matrices, can be avoided with a double-Cayley transform or a three-recursion remedy. A detailed convergence analysis is conducted for the proposed algorithm, especially on the benign effects of the double-Cayley transform. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and structure-preserving nature of the algorithm.;math.NA
1801.00901;Bounded birationality and isomorphism problems are computable;Let $X,Y$ be two irreducible subvarieties of the projective space $\mathbb{P}^n$, and $d\geq 1$ an integer number. The main result of this paper is an algorithm to construct {\bf explicitly}, in terms of $d$ and the ideals defining $X$ and $Y$, a quasi-affine algebraic variety parametrising the set of all birational maps $f$ from $X$ onto $Y$ which can be extended to a self-rational map of $\mathbb{P}^n$ of degree $\leq d$. <br />Based on this result, we propose an approach towards the rationality problem (see Section 3 below), solve it for some simple cases (varieties of general type or curves), and state a rough strategy for reducing it to some simpler cases via Iitaka's fibrations. <br />We also prove similar results for the case $f$ is a dominant rational map, regular morphism, isomorphism or regular embedding. Similar results are valid for varieties over an arbitrary algebraically closed field, and also for maps on non-projective varieties.;math.AG
1801.00919;Compact-Like Operators in Vector Lattices Normed by Locally Solid Lattices;A linear operator $T$ between two vector lattices normed by locally solid Riesz spaces is said to be $p_\tau$-continuous if, for any $p_\tau$-null net $(x_\alpha)$, the net $(Tx_\alpha)$ is $p_\tau$-null, and $T$ is said to be $p_\tau$-bounded operator if it sends $p_\tau$-bounded subsets to $p_\tau$-bounded subsets. Also, $T$ is called $p_\tau$-compact if, for any $p_\tau$-bounded net $(x_\alpha)$, the net $(Tx_\alpha)$ has a $p_\tau$-convergent subnet. They generalize several known classes of operators such as norm continuous, order continuous, $p$-continuous, order bounded, $p$-bounded, compact and AM-compact operators. We study the general properties of these operators.;math.FA
1801.00921;A finite field analogue of the Appell series $F_4$;We define a function $F_4^{\ast}$ as a finite field analogue of the classical Appell series $F_4$ using Gauss sums. We establish identities for $F_4^{\ast}$ analogous to those satisfied by the classical Appell series $F_4$.;math.NT
1801.00922;Motivic spectral sequence for relative homotopy K-theory;We construct a motivic spectral sequence for the relative homotopy invariant K-theory of a closed immersion of schemes $D \subset X$. The $E_2$-terms of this spectral sequence are the cdh-hypercohomology of a complex of equi-dimensional cycles. <br />Using this spectral sequence, we obtain a cycle class map from the relative motivic cohomology group of 0-cycles to the relative homotopy invariant K-theory. For a smooth scheme $X$ and a divisor $D \subset X$, we construct a canonical homomorphism from the Chow groups with modulus $\CH^i(X|D)$ to the relative motivic cohomology groups $H^{2i}(X|D, \Z(i))$ appearing in the above spectral sequence. This map is shown to be an isomorphism when $X$ is affine and $i = \dim(X)$.;math.AG
1801.00923;On the Application of Reduced Basis Methods to Bifurcation Problems in Incompressible Fluid Dynamics;In this paper we apply a reduced basis framework for the computation of flow bifurcation (and stability) problems in fluid dynamics. The proposed method aims at reducing the complexity and the computational time required for the construction of bifurcation and stability diagrams. The method is quite general since it can in principle be specialized to a wide class of nonlinear problems, but in this work we focus on an application in incompressible fluid dynamics at low Reynolds numbers. The validation of the reduced order model with the full order computation for a benchmark cavity flow problem is promising.;math.NA
1801.00924;Joint Content Delivery and Caching Placement via Dynamic Programming;In this paper, downlink delivery of popular content is optimized with the assistance of wireless cache nodes. Specifically, the requests of one file is modeled as a Poisson point process with finite lifetime, and two downlink transmission modes are considered: (1) the base station multicasts file segments to the requesting users and selected cache nodes, (2) the base station proactively multicasts file segments to the selected cache nodes without requests from users. Hence the cache nodes with decoded files can help to offload the traffic upon the next file request via other air interfaces, e.g. WiFi. Without proactive caching placement, we formulate the downlink traffic offloading as a Markov decision process with random number of stages, and propose a revised Bellman's equation to obtain the optimal control policy. In order to address the prohibitively huge state space, we also introduce a low-complexity sub-optimal solution based on linear approximation of the value functions, where the gap between the approximated value functions and the real ones is bounded analytically. The approximated value functions can be calculated from analytical expressions given the spatial distribution of requesting users. Moreover, we propose a learning-based algorithm to evaluate the approximated value functions for unknown distribution of requesting users. Finally, a proactive caching placement algorithm is introduced to exploit the temporal diversity of shadowing effect. It is shown by simulation that the proposed low-complexity algorithm based on approximated value functions can significantly reduce the resource consumption at the base station, and the proactive caching placement can further improve the performance.;cs.IT
1801.00925;Transcendental singularities for a meromorphic function with logarithmic derivative of finite lower order;In this note it is shown that two key results on transcendental singularities for meromorphic functions of finite lower order have refinements which hold under the weaker hypothesis that the logarithmic derivative has finite lower order.;math.CV

1801.00931;A discrete event traffic model explaining the traffic phases of the train dynamics in a metro line system with a junction;This paper presents a mathematical model for the train dynamics in a mass-transit metro line system with one symmetrically operated junction. We distinguish three parts: a central part and two branches. The tracks are spatially discretized into segments (or blocks) and the train dynamics are described by a discrete event system where the variables are the $k^{th}$ departure times from each segment. The train dynamics are based on two main constraints: a travel time constraint modeling theoretic run and dwell times, and a safe separation constraint modeling the signaling system in case where the traffic gets very dense. The Max-plus algebra model allows to analytically derive the asymptotic average train frequency as a function of many parameters, including train travel times, minimum safety intervals, the total number of trains on the line and the number of trains on each branch. This derivation permits to understand the physics of traffic. In a further step, the results will be used for traffic control.;math.OC
1801.00941;Rigidity results in Diffusion Markov Triples;We consider stable solutions of semilinear equations in a very general setting. The equation is set on a Polish topological space endowed with a measure and the linear operator is induced by a carr\'e du champs (equivalently, the equation is set in a diffusion Markov triple). Under suitable curvature dimension conditions, we establish that stable solutions with integrable carr\'e du champs are necessarily constant (weaker conditions characterize the structure of the carr\'e du champs and carr\'e du champ it\'er\'e). The proofs are based on a geometric Poincar\'e formula in this setting. From the general theorems established, several previous results are obtained as particular cases and new ones are provided as well.;math.AP
1801.00947;Modulus Zero-Forcing Detection for MIMO Channels;We propose a modulus based zero-forcing (MZF) detection for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channels. Traditionally, a ZF detector nulls out all interferences from other layers when detecting a current layer, which can yield suboptimal detection-performance due to the noise-enhancement issue. In many communication systems, finite alphabets such as M quadrature-amplitude-modulation (QAM) are widely used, which comprises \sqrt{M} pulse-amplitude-modulation (PAM) symbols for the real and imaginary parts. With finite alphabets, one feasible way to improve ZF detection is to allow controllable interferences that can be removed away by modulus operations.;cs.IT
1801.00950;Barotropic instability of shear flows;We consider barotropic instability of shear flows for incompressible fluids with Coriolis effects. For a class of shear flows, we develop a new method to find the sharp stability conditions. We study the flow with Sinus profile in details and obtain the sharp stability boundary in the whole parameter space, which corrects previous results in the fluid literature. Our new results are confirmed by more accurate numerical computation. The addition of the Coriolis force is found to bring fundamental changes to the stability of shear flows. Moreover, we study dynamical behaviors near the shear flows, including the bifurcation of nontrivial traveling wave solutions and the linear inviscid damping. The first ingredient of our proof is a careful classification of the neutral modes. The second one is to write the linearized fluid equation in a Hamiltonian form and then use an instability index theory for general Hamiltonian PDEs. The last one is to study the singular and non-resonant neutral modes using Sturm-Liouville theory and hypergeometric functions.;math.AP

We focus on the centrally essential modular group algebras of finite groups over fields of nonzero characteristic.

1801.00952;Non-isometric domains with the same Marvizi-Melrose invariants;For any strictly convex planar domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ with a $C^\infty$ boundary one can associate an infinite sequence of spectral invariants introduced by Marvizi-Merlose. These invariants can generically be determined using the spectrum of the Dirichlet problem of the Laplace operator. A natural question asks if this collection is sufficient to determine $\Omega$ up to isometry. In this paper we give a counterexample, namely, we present two non-isometric domains $\Omega$ and $\bar \Omega$ with the same collection of Marvizi-Melrose invariants. Moreover, each domain has countably many periodic orbits $\{S^n\}_{n \geqslant 1}$ (resp. $\{ \bar S^n\}_{n \geqslant 1}$) of period going to infinity such that $ S^n $ and $ \bar S^n $ have the same period and perimeter for each $ n $.;math.DS
1801.00953;Admissibility and the $C_2$ Spider;A tensor category is multiplicity-free if for any objects $A,B,C$ we have that $\mathrm{Hom}(A\otimes B\otimes C,\mathbb{C})$ is either $0$ or $1$ dimensional. It is known that $Rep^{uni}(U_q(\mathfrak{sp}(4)))$ is not multiplicty-free. We find a full subcategory of $Rep^{uni}(U_q(\mathfrak{sp}(4)))$ which is multiplicty-free. A description of the dimension of these $\mathrm{Hom}$ spaces is given for this subcategory, including when $q$ is a root of unity. The methods used arise from the description, given by Kuperberg, of $Rep^{uni}(U_q(\mathfrak{sp}(4)))$ as a spider. The main tool is the recursive definition of clasps given by Kim. In particular, we provide an appropriate notion of admissibility when looking at the $\mathrm{Sp}(4)_k$ ribbon graph invariants with restricted edge labels.;math.QA
1801.00957;Exponential stabilization of cascade ode-reaction-diffusion pde by pointwise actuation;In this paper, we are concerned with the state feedback stabilization of ODE-PDE cascade systems governed by a linear ordinary differential equation and the 1-d reaction-diffusion equation posed on a bounded interval. In contrast to the previous works in the literature where the control acts at the boundary, the control for the entire system acts at an inside point of the PDE domain whereas the PDE acts in the linear ODE by a Neumann connection. We use the infinite dimensional backstepping design to convert system under consideration to an exponentially target system. By invertibility of the design and Lyapunov analysis, we prove the well posedness and exponential stability of such system.;math.AP
1801.00958;Exponential stabilization of cascade ode-linearized kdv system by boundary Dirichlet actuation;In this paper, we solve the problem of exponential stabilization for a class of cascade ODE-PDE system governed by a linear ordinary differential equation and a 1-d linearized Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV) posed on a bounded interval. The control for the entire system acts on the left boundary with Dirichlet condition of the KdV equation whereas the KdV acts in the linear ODE by a Dirichlet connection. We use the socalled backstepping design in infinite dimension to convert the system under consideration into an exponentially stable cascade ODE-PDE system.Then, we use the invertibility of such design to achieve the exponential stability for the ODE-PDE cascade system under consideration by using Lyapunov analysis.;math.AP
1801.00961;On maximum distance separable group codes with complementary duals;Given an LCD group code $C$ in a group algebra $KG$, we inspect kinship between $C$ and $G$, more precisely between the subgroup structures of $G$ and $C$. Under some special circumstances our inspection provides an estimation for various parameters of a group code $C$. When $C$ is MDS, the inter relation between $K$ and $G$ becomes more impressive. Application of Sylow theorem facilitated us to explore the inter relation between $G$ and $K$ (when $C$ is LCD and MDS) in more general way and finally we get the result of Cruz and Willems (Lemma $4.4$) as a simple sequel.;math.RA
1801.00963;A New Design Paradigm for Secure Full-Duplex Multiuser Systems;We consider a full-duplex (FD) multiuser system where an FD base station (BS) is designed to simultaneously serve both downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) users in the presence of half-duplex eavesdroppers (Eves). The problem is to maximize the minimum (max-min) secrecy rate (SR) among all legitimate users, where the information signals at the FD-BS are accompanied with artificial noise to debilitate the Eves' channels. To enhance the max-min SR, a major part of the power budget should be allocated to serve the users with poor channel qualities, such as those far from the FD-BS, undermining the SR for other users, and thus compromising the SR per-user. In addition, the main obstacle in designing an FD system is due to the self-interference (SI) and co-channel interference (CCI) among users. We therefore propose an alternative solution, where the FD-BS uses a fraction of the time block to serve near DL users and far UL users, and the remaining fractional time to serve other users. The proposed scheme mitigates the harmful effects of SI, CCI and multiuser interference, and provides system robustness. The SR optimization problem has a highly nonconcave and nonsmooth objective, subject to nonconvex constraints. For the case of perfect channel state information (CSI), we develop a low-complexity path-following algorithm, which involves only a simple convex program of moderate dimension at each iteration. We show that our path-following algorithm guarantees convergence at least to a local optimum. Then, we extend the path-following algorithm to the cases of partially known Eves' CSI, where only statistics of CSI for the Eves are known, and worst-case scenario in which Eves can employ a more advanced linear decoder. The merit of our proposed approach is further demonstrated by extensive numerical results.;cs.IT
1801.00965;Phase Transition of Convex Programs for Linear Inverse Problems with Multiple Prior Constraints;A sharp phase transition emerges in convex programs when solving the linear inverse problem, which aims to recover a structured signal from its linear measurements. This paper studies this phenomenon in theory under Gaussian random measurements. Different from previous studies, in this paper, we consider convex programs with multiple prior constraints. These programs are encountered in many cases, for example, when the signal is sparse and its $\ell_2$ norm is known beforehand, or when the signal is sparse and non-negative simultaneously. Given such a convex program, to analyze its phase transition, we introduce a new set and a new cone, called the prior restricted set and prior restricted cone, respectively. Our results reveal that the phase transition of a convex problem occurs at the statistical dimension of its prior restricted cone. Moreover, to apply our theoretical results in practice, we present two recipes to accurately estimate the statistical dimension of the prior restricted cone. These two recipes work under different conditions, and we give a detailed analysis for them. To further illustrate our results, we apply our theoretical results and the estimation recipes to study the phase transition of two specific problems, and obtain computable formulas for the statistical dimension and related error bounds. Simulations are provided to demonstrate our results.;cs.IT

We define these transforms in such a way that they characterize any probability distribution on the real line and are Fenchel conjugates of each other. We show that uniform integrability, weak convergence and tightness admit a convenient characterization in terms of integrated quantile functions. As an application we demonstrate how some basic results of the theory of comparison of binary statistical experiments can be deduced using integrated quantile functions. Finally, we extend the area of application of the Chacon--Walsh construction in the Skorokhod embedding problem.;math.PR

1801.00981;A Model-Free Selection Criterion For The Mixing Coefficient Of Spatial Max-Mixture Models;One of the main concerns in extreme value theory is to quantify the dependence between joint tails. Using stochastic processes that lack flexibility in the joint tail may lead to severe under-or over-estimation of probabilities associated to simultaneous extreme events. Following recent advances in the literature, a flexible model called max-mixture model has been introduced for modeling situations where the extremal dependence structure may vary with the distance. In this paper we propose a nonparametric model-free selection criterion for the mixing coefficient Our criterion is derived from a madogram, a notion classically used in geostatistics to capture spatial structures. The procedure is based on a nonlinear least squares between the theoretical madogram and the empirical one. We perform a simulation study and apply our criterion to daily precipitation over the East of Australia.;math.ST
1801.00983;Stabilisation of wave equations on the torus with rough dampings;For the damped wave equation on a compact manifold with {\em continuous} dampings, the geometric control condition is necessary and sufficient for {uniform} stabilisation. In this article, on the two dimensional torus, in the special case where $a(x) = \sum\_{j=1}^N a\_j 1\_{x\in R\_j}$ ($R\_j$ are polygons), we give a very simple necessary and sufficient geometric condition for uniform stabilisation. We also propose a natural generalization of the geometric control condition which makes sense for $L^\infty$ dampings. We show that this condition is always necessary for uniform stabilisation (for any compact (smooth) manifold and any $L^\infty$ damping), and we prove that it is sufficient in our particular case on $\mathbb{T}^2$ (and for our particular dampings).;math.AP

By nonzero rectangular Kronecker coefficients, we give counterexamples for Klyachko's conjecture which says that a quantum state with maximal lexicographical spectrum has minimal rank among all states with given margins. Moreover, we show that quantum states with the maximal lexicographical spectrum are extreme points.;math.RT
1801.00988;Joint Uplink and Downlink Resource Configuration for Ultra-reliable and Low-latency Communications;Supporting ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) is one of the major goals for the fifth-generation cellular networks. Since spectrum usage efficiency is always a concern, and large bandwidth is required for ensuring stringent quality-of-service (QoS), we minimize the total bandwidth under the QoS constraints of URLLC. We first propose a packet delivery mechanism for URLLC. To reduce the required bandwidth for ensuring queueing delay, we consider a statistical multiplexing queueing mode, where the packets to be sent to different devices are waiting in one queue at the base station, and broadcast mode is adopted in downlink transmission. In this way, downlink bandwidth is shared among packets of multiple devices. In uplink transmission, different subchannels are allocated to different devices to avoid strong interference. Then, we jointly optimize uplink and downlink bandwidth configuration and delay components to minimize the total bandwidth required to guarantee the overall packet loss and end-to-end delay, which includes uplink and downlink transmission delays, queueing delay and backhaul delay. We propose a two-step method to find the optimal solution. Simulation and numerical results validate our analysis and show remarkable performance gain by jointly optimizing uplink and downlink configuration.;cs.IT
1801.00989;On the invariance equation for two-variable weighted nonsymmetric Bajraktarevi&#x107, means;The purpose of this paper is to investigate the invariance of the arithmetic mean with respect to two weighted Bajraktarevi\'c means, i.e., to solve the functional equation $$ <br />\bigg(\frac{f}{g}\bigg)^{\!\!-1}\!\!\bigg(\frac{tf(x)+sf(y)}{tg(x)+sg(y)}\bigg) <br />+\bigg(\frac{h}{k}\bigg)^{\!\!-1}\!\!\bigg(\frac{sh(x)+th(y)}{sk(x)+tk(y)}\bigg)=x+y \qquad(x,y\in I), $$ where $f,g,h,k:I\to\mathbb{R}$ are unknown continuous functions such that $g,k$ are nowhere zero on $I$, the ratio functions $f/g$, $h/k$ are strictly monotone on $I$, and $t,s\in\mathbb{R}_+$ are constants different from each other. By the main result of this paper, the solutions of the above invariance equation can be expressed either in terms of hyperbolic functions or in terms of trigonometric functions and an additional weight function. For the necessity part of this result, we will assume that $f,g,h,k:I\to\mathbb{R}$ are four times continuously differentiable.;math.CA
1801.00990;A two-stage fourth order time-accurate discretization for Lax--Wendroff type flow solvers II. High order numerical boundary conditions;This paper serves to treat boundary conditions numerically with high order accuracy in order to match the two-stage fourth-order finite volume schemes for hyperbolic problems developed in [{\em J. Li and Z. Du, A two-stage fourth order time-accurate discretization {L}ax--{W}endroff type flow solvers, {I}. {H}yperbolic conservation laws, SIAM, J. Sci. Comput., 38 (2016), pp.~A3046--A3069}]. As such, it is significant when capturing small scale structures near physical boundaries. Different from previous contributions in literature, the current approach constructs a fourth order accurate approximation to boundary conditions by only using the Jacobian of the flux function (characteristic information) instead of its successive differentiation leading to tensors of high ranks in the inverse Lax-Wendroff method. Technically, data in several ghost cells are constructed with interpolation so that the interior scheme can be implemented over boundary cells, and theoretical boundary condition has to be modified properly at intermediate stages so as to make the two-stage scheme over boundary cells fully consistent with that over interior cells. This highlights the fact that {\em continuous boundary conditions only match continuous partial differential equations (PDEs), and they must be approximated in a consistent way (even though it could be exactly valued) when the PDEs are discretized.} Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the current approach when dealing with general boundary conditions.;math.NA
1801.00992;The Capacity on Degraded Relay Broadcast Channel;The relay broadcast channel (RBC) is considered, in which a transmitter communicates with two receivers with the assistance of a relay. Based on different degradation orders among the relay and the receivers' outputs, three types of physically degraded RBCs (PDRBCs) are introduced. Inner bounds and outer bounds are derived on the capacity region of the presented three types. The bounds are tight for two types of PDRBCs: 1) one receiver's output is a degraded form of the other receiver's output, and the relay's output is a degraded form of the weaker receiver's output, 2) one receiver's output is a degraded form of the relay's output, and the other receiver's output is a degraded form of the relay's output. For the Gaussian PDRBC, the bounds match, i.e., establish its capacity region.;cs.IT
1801.01006;The risk model with stochastic premiums, dependence and a threshold dividend strategy;The paper deals with a generalization of the risk model with stochastic premiums where dependence structures between claim sizes and inter-claim times as well as premium sizes and inter-premium times are modeled by Farlie--Gumbel--Morgenstern copulas. In addition, dividends are paid to its shareholders according to a threshold dividend strategy. We derive integral and integro-differential equations for the Gerber--Shiu function and the expected discounted dividend payments until ruin. Next, we concentrate on the detailed investigation of the model in the case of exponentially distributed claim and premium sizes. In particular, we find explicit formulas for the ruin probability in the model without either dividend payments or dependence as well as for the expected discounted dividend payments in the model without dependence. Finally, numerical illustrations are presented.;math.PR
1801.01007;A Comprehensive Bayesian Treatment of the Universal Kriging model with Mat&#xe9,rn correlation kernels;The Gibbs reference posterior distribution provides an objective full-Bayesian solution to the problem of prediction of a stationary Gaussian process with Mat\'ern anisotropic kernel. A full-Bayesian approach is possible, because the posterior distribution is expressed as the invariant distribution of a uniformly ergodic Markovian kernel for which we give an explicit expression. In this paper, we show that it is appropriate for the Universal Kriging framework, that is when an unknown function is added to the stationary Gaussian process. We give sufficient conditions for the existence and propriety of the Gibbs reference posterior that apply to a wide variety of practical cases and illustrate the method with several examples. Finally, simulations of Gaussian processes suggest that the Gibbs reference posterior has good frequentist properties in terms of coverage of prediction intervals.;math.ST

1801.01014;Finite asymptotic clusters of metric spaces;Let $(X, d)$ be an unbounded metric space and let $\tilde r=(r_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ be a sequence of positive real numbers tending to infinity. A pretangent space $\Omega_{\infty, \tilde r}^{X}$ to $(X, d)$ at infinity is a limit of the rescaling sequence $\left(X, \frac{1}{r_n}d\right).$ The set of all pretangent spaces $\Omega_{\infty, \tilde r}^{X}$ is called an asymptotic cluster of pretangent spaces. Such a cluster can be considered as a weighted graph $(G_{X, \tilde r}, \rho_{X})$ whose maximal cliques coincide with $\Omega_{\infty, \tilde r}^{X}$ and the weight $\rho_{X}$ is defined by metrics on $\Omega_{\infty, \tilde r}^{X}$. We describe the structure of metric spaces having finite asymptotic clusters of pretangent spaces and characterize the finite weighted graphs which are isomorphic to these clusters.;math.MG

1801.01022;Shannon Capacity is Achievable for Binary Interactive First-Order Markovian Protocols;We address the problem of simulating an arbitrary binary interactive first-order Markovian protocol over a pair of binary symmetric channels with crossover probability $\varepsilon$. We are interested in the achievable rates of reliable simulation, i.e., in characterizing the smallest possible blowup in communications such that a vanishing error probability (in the protocol length) can be attained. Whereas for general interactive protocols the output of each party may depend on all previous outputs of its counterpart, in a (first-order) Markovian protocol this dependence is limited to the last observed output only. Previous works in the field discuss broader families of protocols but assess the achievable rates only at the limit where $\varepsilon\to0$. <br />In this paper, we prove that the one-way Shannon capacity, $1-h(\varepsilon)$, can be achieved for any binary first-order Markovian protocol. This surprising result, is to the best of our knowledge, the first example in which non-trivial interactive protocol can be simulated in the Shannon capacity. We give two capacity achieving coding schemes, which both divide the protocol into independent blocks, and implement vertical block coding. The first scheme is based on a random separation into blocks with variable lengths. The second scheme is based on a deterministic separation into blocks, and efficiently predicting their last transmission. The prediction can be regarded as a binary pointer jumping game, for which we show that the final step can be calculated with $O(\log m)$ bits, where $m$ is the number of rounds in the game. We conclude the work by discussing possible extensions of the result to higher order models.;cs.IT
1801.01023;Calder&#xf3,n-Zygmund operators on Zygmund spaces on domains;Given a bounded Lipschitz domain $D\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and a Calder\'on-Zygmund operator $T$, we study the relations between smoothness properties of $\partial D$ and the boundedness of $T$ on the Zydmund space $\mathcal{C}_{\omega}(D)$ defined for a general growth function $\omega$. In the proof we obtain a T(P) theorem for the Zygmund spaces, when one checks boundedness not only of the characteristic function, but a finite collection of polynomials restricted to the domain. Also, a new form of extra cancellation property of the even Calder\'on-Zygmund operators in polynomial domains is stated.;math.FA

We also establish an optimal rate of density for the values of polynomials maps in a number of other natural problems, including the values of linear forms restricted to suitable quadratic surfaces, and the values of the polynomial map defined by the generators of the ring of conjugation-invariant polynomials on $M_3(\C)$. <br />These results are instances of a general approach that we develop, which considers a rational affine algebraic subvariety of Euclidean space, invariant and homogeneous under an action of a semisimple Lie group $G$. Given a polynomial map $F$ defined on the Euclidean space which is invariant under a semisimple subgroup $H$ of the acting group $G$, consider the family of its translates $F\circ g$ by elements of the group. We study the restriction of these polynomial functions to the integer points on the variety confined to a large Euclidean ball. Our main results establish an explicit rate of density for their values, for generic polynomials in the family. This problem has been extensively studied before when the polynomials in question are linear, in the context of classical Diophantine approximation, but very little was known about it for polynomial of higher degree. We formulate a heuristic pigeonhole lower bound for the density and an explicit upper bound for it, formulate a sufficient condition for the coincidence of the lower and upper bounds, and in a number of natural examples establish that they indeed match. Finally, we also establish a rate of density for values of homogeneous polynomials on homogeneous projective varieties.;math.NT

1801.01030;Dissipative measure valued solutions for general conservation laws;In the last years measure-valued solutions started to be considered as a relevant notion of solutions if they satisfy the so-called measure-valued -- strong uniqueness principle. This means that they coincide with a strong solution emanating from the same initial data if this strong solution exists. This property has been examined for many systems of mathematical physics, including incompressible and compressible Euler system, compressible Navier-Stokes system et al. and there are also some results concerning general hyperbolic systems. Our goal is to provide a unified framework for general systems, that would cover the most interesting cases of systems, and most importantly, we give examples of equations, for which the aspect of measure-valued -- strong uniqueness has not been considered before, like incompressible magentohydrodynamics and shallow water magnetohydrodynamics.;math.AP

1801.01047;On the exact maximum induced density of almost all graphs and their inducibility;Let $H$ be a graph on $h$ vertices. The number of induced copies of $H$ in a graph $G$ is denoted by $i_H(G)$. Let $i_H(n)$ denote the maximum of $i_H(G)$ taken over all graphs $G$ with $n$ vertices. <br />Let $f(n,h) = \Pi_{i}^h a_i$ where $\sum_{i=1}^h a_i = n$ and the $a_i$ are as equal as possible. Let $g(n,h) = f(n,h) + \sum_{i=1}^h g(a_i,h)$. It is proved that for almost all graphs $H$ on $h$ vertices it holds that $i_H(n)=g(n,h)$ for all $n \le 2^{\sqrt{h}}$. More precisely, we define an explicit graph property ${\cal P}_h$ which, when satisfied by $H$, guarantees that $i_H(n)=g(n,h)$ for all $n \le 2^{\sqrt{h}}$. It is proved, in particular, that a random graph on $h$ vertices satisfies ${\cal P}_h$ with probability $1-o_h(1)$. Furthermore, all extremal $n$-vertex graphs yielding $i_H(n)$ in the aforementioned range are determined. <br />We also prove a stability result. For $H \in {\cal P}_h$ and a graph $G$ with $n \le 2^{\sqrt{h}}$ vertices satisfying $i_H(G) \ge f(n,h)$, it must be that $G$ is obtained from a balanced blowup of $H$ by adding some edges inside the blowup parts. <br />The {\em inducibility} of $H$ is $i_H = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} i_H(n)/\binom{n}{h}$. It is known that $i_H \ge h!/(h^h-h)$ for all graphs $H$ and that a random graph $H$ satisfies almost surely that $i_H \le h^{3\log h}h!/(h^h-h)$. We improve upon this upper bound almost matching the lower bound. It is shown that a graph $H$ which satisfies ${\cal P}_h$ has $i_H =(1+O(h^{-h^{1/3}}))h!/(h^h-h)$.;math.CO
1801.01050;Information Bottleneck on General Alphabets;We prove rigorously a source coding theorem that can probably be considered folklore, a generalization to arbitrary alphabets of a problem motivated by the Information Bottleneck method.

The proof relies on the well established discrete case and showcases a technique for lifting discrete coding theorems to arbitrary alphabets.;cs.IT
1801.01055;Gaps between prime numbers and tensor rank of multiplication in finite fields;We present effective upper bounds on the symmetric bilinear complexity of multiplication in extensions of a base finite field Fp2 of prime square order, obtained by combining estimates on gaps between prime numbers together with an optimal construction of auxiliary divisors for multiplication algorithms by evaluation-interpolation on curves. Most of this material dates back to a 2011 unpublished work of the author, but it still provides the best results on this topic at the present time. <br />Then a few updates are given in order to take recent developments into account, including comparison with a similar work of Ballet and Zykin, generalization to classical bilinear complexity over Fp, and to short multiplication of polynomials, as well as a discussion of open questions on gaps between prime numbers or more generally values of certain arithmetic functions.;math.NT
1801.01056;A New HDG Method for Dirichlet Boundary Control of Convection Diffusion PDEs II: Low Regularity;In the first part of this work, we analyzed a Dirichlet boundary control problem for an elliptic convection diffusion PDE and proposed a new hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method to approximate the solution. For the case of a 2D polygonal domain, we also proved an optimal superlinear convergence rate for the control under certain assumptions on the domain and on the target state. In this work, we revisit the convergence analysis without these assumptions, in this case, the solution can have low regularity and we use a different analysis approach. We again prove an optimal convergence rate for the control, and present numerical results to illustrate the convergence theory.;math.NA
1801.01060;A strictly commutative model for the cochain algebra of a space;The commutative differential graded algebra $A_{\mathrm{PL}}(X)$ of polynomial forms on a simplicial set $X$ is a crucial tool in rational homotopy theory. In this note, we construct an integral version $A^{\mathcal{I}}(X)$ of $A_{\mathrm{PL}}(X)$. Our approach uses diagrams of chain complexes indexed by the category of finite sets and injections $\mathcal{I}$ to model $E_{\infty}$ differential graded algebras by strictly commutative objects, called commutative $\mathcal{I}$-dgas. We define a functor $A^{\mathcal{I}}$ from simplicial sets to commutative $\mathcal{I}$-dgas and show that it is a commutative lift of the usual cochain algebra functor. In particular, it gives rise to a new construction of the $E_{\infty}$ dga of cochains. <br />The functor $A^{\mathcal{I}}$ shares many properties of $A_{\mathrm{PL}}$, and can be viewed as a generalization of $A_{\mathrm{PL}}$ that works over arbitrary commutative ground rings. Working over the integers, a theorem by Mandell implies that $A^{\mathcal{I}}(X)$ determines the homotopy type of $X$ when $X$ is a nilpotent space of finite type.;math.AT
1801.01062;Construction of Algorithms for Parallel Addition;An algebraic number $\beta \in \mathbb{C}$ with no conjugate of modulus 1 can serve as the base of a numeration system $(\beta, \mathcal{A})$ with parallel addition, i.e., the sum of two operands represented in base $\beta$ with digits from $\mathcal{A}$ is calculated in constant time, irrespective of the length of the operands. In order to allow parallel addition, sufficient level of redundancy must be given to the alphabet $\mathcal{A}$. The complexity of parallel addition algorithm depends heavily on the size $\#\mathcal{A}$ of the alphabet: the bigger alphabet is considered, the lower complexity of the parallel addition algorithm may be reached, and vice versa. Here we aim to find parallel addition algorithms on alphabets of the minimal possible size, for a given base. As the complexity of these algorithms becomes quite huge in general, we introduce a so-called Extending Window Method (EWM) - in fact an algorithm to construct parallel addition algorithms. This method can be applied on bases $\beta$ which are expanding algebraic integers, i.e., $\beta$ whose all conjugates are greater than 1 in modulus. Convergence of the EWM is not guaranteed, nevertheless, we have developed tools for revealing non-convergence, and there is a number of successful applications. Firstly, the EWM provides the same parallel addition algorithms as were previously introduced by A. Avizienis, C.Y. Chow &amp, J.E. Robertson or B. Parhami for integer bases and alphabets. Then, by applying the EWM on selected complex bases $\beta$ with non-integer alphabets $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathbb{Z}[\beta]$, we obtain new results - parallel addition algorithms on alphabets of minimal possible size, which could not be found so far (manually). The EWM is helpful also in the case of block parallel addition.;math.NT
1801.01069;Theoretical links between universal and Bayesian compressed sensing algorithms;Quantized maximum a posteriori (Q-MAP) is a recently-proposed Bayesian compressed sensing algorithm that, given the source distribution, recovers $X^n$ from its linear measurements $Y^m=AX^n$, where $A\in R^{m\times n}$ denotes the known measurement matrix. On the other hand, Lagrangian minimum entropy pursuit (L-MEP) is a universal compressed sensing algorithm that aims at recovering $X^n$ from its linear measurements $Y^m=AX^n$, without having access to the source distribution. Both Q-MAP and L-MEP provably achieve the minimum required sampling rates, in noiseless cases where such fundamental limits are known. L-MEP is based on minimizing a cost function that consists of a linear combination of the conditional empirical entropy of a potential reconstruction vector and its corresponding measurement error. In this paper, using a first-order linear approximation of the conditional empirical entropy function, L-MEP is connected with Q-MAP. The established connection between L-MEP and Q-MAP leads to variants of Q-MAP which have the same asymptotic performance as Q-MAP in terms of their required sampling rates. Moreover, these variants suggest that Q-MAP is robust to small error in estimating the source distribution. This robustness is theoretically proven and the effect of a non-vanishing estimation error on the required sampling rate is characterized.;cs.IT
1801.01072;Randomized Linear Algebra Approaches to Estimate the Von Neumann Entropy of Density Matrices;Thevon Neumann entropy, named after John von Neumann, is an extension of the classical concept of entropy to the field of quantum mechanics. From a numerical perspective, von Neumann entropy can be computed simply by computing all eigenvalues of a density matrix, an operation that could be prohibitively expensive for large-scale density matrices. We present and analyze three randomized algorithms to approximate von Neumann entropy of {real} density matrices: our algorithms leverage recent developments in the Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra (RandNLA) literature, such as randomized trace estimators, provable bounds for the power method, and the use of random projections to approximate the eigenvalues of a matrix. All three algorithms come with provable accuracy guarantees and our experimental evaluations support our theoretical findings showing considerable speedup with small loss in accuracy.;cs.IT
1801.01074;Forcing large tight components in 3-graphs;Any $n$-vertex $3$-graph with minimum codegree at least $\lfloor n/3\rfloor$ must have a spanning tight component, but immediately below this threshold it is possible for no tight component to span more than $\lceil 2n/3\rceil$ vertices. Motivated by this observation, we ask which codegree forces a tight component of at least any given size. The corresponding function seems to have infinitely many discontinuities, but we provide upper and lower bounds, which asymptotically converge as the function nears the origin.;math.CO
1801.01079;Exact Calculation of the Mean-Square Error in the Method of Expansion of Iterated Ito Stochastic integrals Based on Generalized Multiple Fourier Series;The article is devoted to the developement of the method of expansion and mean-square approximation of iterated Ito stochastic integrals based on generalized multiple Fourier series converging in the sense of norm in the space $L_2([t, T]^k)$ ($k$ is the multiplicity of the iterated Ito stochastic integral). We obtain the exact and approximate expressions for the mean-square error of approximation of iterated Ito stochastic integrals of multiplicity $k$ ($k\in\mathbb{N}$) from the stochastic Taylor-Ito expansion in the framework of the mentioned method. As a result, we do not need to use redundant terms of expansions of iterated Ito stochastic integrals, that complicate the numerical methods for Ito stochastic differential equations. Moreover, we proved the convergence with propability 1 of the method of expansion of iterated Ito stochastic integrals based on generalized multiple Fourier series for the cases of multiple Fourier-Legendre series and multiple trigonometric Fourier series. The results of the article can be applied to the high-order strong numerical methods for Ito stochastic differential equations as well as non-commutative semilinear stochastic partial differential equations with multiplicative trace class noise (in accordance with the mean-square criterion of convergence).;math.PR
1801.01082;A first integrability result for Miquel dynamics;Miquel dynamics is a discrete-time dynamical system on the space of square-grid circle patterns. For biperiodic circle patterns with both periods equal to two, we show that the dynamics corresponds to translation on an elliptic curve, thus providing the first integrability result for this dynamics. The main tool is a geometric interpretation of the addition law on the normalization of binodal quartic curves.;math.DS

We also find the ratio between the determinant of the moment matrix corresponding to the multiple orthogonal polynomials and the determinant of the moment matrix from the original planar measure.;math-ph
1801.01088;Convergence rates of Forward--Douglas--Rachford splitting method;Over the past years, operator splitting methods have become ubiquitous for non-smooth optimization owing to their simplicity and efficiency. In this paper, we consider the Forward--Douglas--Rachford splitting method (FDR) [10,40], and study both global and local convergence rates of this method. For the global rate, we establish an $o(1/k)$ convergence rate in terms of a Bregman divergence suitably designed for the objective function. Moreover, when specializing to the case of Forward--Backward splitting method, we show that convergence rate of the objective function of the method is actually $o(1/k)$ for a large choice of the descent step-size. Then locally, based on the assumption that the non-smooth part of the optimization problem is partly smooth, we establish local linear convergence of the method. More precisely, we show that the sequence generated by FDR method first (i) identifies a smooth manifold in a finite number of iteration, and then (ii) enters a local linear convergence regime, which is for instance characterized in terms of the structure of the underlying active smooth manifold. To exemplify the usefulness of the obtained result, we consider several concrete numerical experiments arising from applicative fields including, for instance, signal/image processing, inverse problems and machine learning.;math.OC
1801.01091;Independence number of graphs with a prescribed number of cliques;We consider the following problem posed by Erdos in 1962. Suppose that $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph where the number of $s$-cliques in $G$ is $t$. How small can the independence number of $G$ be? Our main result suggests that for fixed $s$, the smallest possible independence number undergoes a transition at $t=n^{s/2+o(1)}$. <br />In the case of triangles ($s=3$) we obtain the following result which is sharp apart from constant factors and generalizes basic results in Ramsey theory: there exists $c&gt,0$ such that every $n$-vertex graph with $t$ triangles has independence number at least $$c \cdot \min\left\{ \sqrt {n \log n}\, , \, \frac{n}{t^{1/3}} \left(\log \frac{n}{ t^{1/3}}\right)^{2/3} \right\}.$$;math.CO

We show that in an appropriate limit $E_{kk}^{(n)} \sim 2\kern .3pt H^{k+1/2}$ independently of $n$, where $H \approx 1/9.28903$ is Halphen's constant. This is the same formula as for minimax approximation of $e^x$ on $(-\infty,0\kern .3pt]$.;math.NA

1801.01101;The Hilbert scheme of space curves sitting on a smooth surface containing a line;We continue the study of maximal families W of the Hilbert scheme, H(d,g)_{sc}, of smooth connected space curves whose general curve C lies on a smooth degree-s surface S containing a line. For s &gt, 3, we extend the two ranges where W is a unique irreducible (resp. generically smooth) component of H(d,g)_{sc}. In another range, close to the boarder of the nef cone, we describe for s=4 and 5 components W that are non-reduced, leaving open the non-reducedness of only 3 (resp. 2) families for s &gt, 5 (resp. s=5), thus making progress to recent results of Kleppe and Ottem in [28]. For s=3 we slightly extend previous results on a conjecture of non-reduced components, and in addition we show its existence in a subrange of the conjectured range.;math.AG
1801.01103;A low-rank projector-splitting integrator for the Vlasov--Poisson equation;Many problems encountered in plasma physics require a description by kinetic equations, which are posed in an up to six-dimensional phase space. A direct discretization of this phase space, often called the Eulerian approach, has many advantages but is extremely expensive from a computational point of view. In the present paper we propose a dynamical low-rank approximation to the Vlasov--Poisson equation, with time integration by a particular splitting method. This approximation is derived by constraining the dynamics to a manifold of low-rank functions via a tangent space projection and by splitting this projection into the subprojections from which it is built. This reduces a time step for the six- (or four-) dimensional Vlasov--Poisson equation to solving two systems of three- (or two-) dimensional advection equations over the time step, once in the position variables and once in the velocity variables, where the size of each system of advection equations is equal to the chosen rank. By a hierarchical dynamical low-rank approximation, a time step for the Vlasov--Poisson equation can be further reduced to a set of six (or four) systems of one-dimensional advection equations, where the size of each system of advection equations is still equal to the rank. The resulting systems of advection equations can then be solved by standard techniques such as semi-Lagrangian or spectral methods. Numerical simulations in two and four dimensions for linear Landau damping, for a two-stream instability and for a plasma echo problem highlight the favorable behavior of this numerical method and show that the proposed algorithm is able to drastically reduce the required computational effort.;math.NA
1801.01106;On certain edge-transitive bicirculants;A graph $\Gamma$ of even order is a bicirculant if it admits an automorphism with two orbits of equal length. Symmetry properties of bicirculants, for which at least one of the induced subgraphs on the two orbits of the corresponding semiregular automorphism is a cycle, have been studied, at least for the few smallest possible valences. For valences $3$, $4$ and $5$, where the corresponding bicirculants are called generalized Petersen graphs, Rose window graphs and Taba\v{c}jn graphs, respectively, all edge-transitive members have been classified. While there are only 7 edge-transitive generalized Petersen graphs and only 3 edge-transitive Taba\v{c}jn graphs, infinite families of edge-transitive Rose window graphs exist. The main theme of this paper is the question of the existence of such bicirculants for higher valences. It is proved that infinite families of edge-transitive examples of valence $6$ exist and among them infinitely many arc-transitive as well as infinitely many half-arc-transitive members are identified. Moreover, the classification of the ones of valence $6$ and girth $3$ is given. As a corollary, an infinite family of half-arc-transitive graphs of valence $6$ with universal reachability relation, which were thus far not known to exist, is obtained.;math.CO
1801.01109;Biderivations and commuting linear maps on Lie algebras;Let $L$ be a Lie algebra over a field of characteristic different from $2$. If $L$ is perfect and centerless, then every skew-symmetric biderivation $\delta:L\times L\to L$ is of the form $\delta(x,y)=\gamma([x,y])$ for all $x,y\in L$, where $\gamma\in{\rm Cent}(L)$, the centroid of $L$. Under a milder assumption that $[c,[L,L]]=\{0\}$ implies $c=0$, every commuting linear map from $L$ to $L$ lies in ${\rm Cent}(L)$. These two results are special cases of our main theorems which concern biderivations and commuting linear maps having their ranges in an $L$-module. We provide a variety of examples, some of them showing the necessity of our assumptions and some of them showing that our results cover several results from the literature.;math.RA

1801.01145;Vectorial Boolean functions and linear codes in the context of algebraic attacks;In this paper we study the relationship between vectorial (Boolean) functions and cyclic codes in the context of algebraic attacks. We first derive a direct link between the annihilators of a vectorial function (in univariate form) and certain $2^{n}$-ary cyclic codes (which we prove that they are LCD codes) extending results due to R{\o}njom and Helleseth. The knowledge of the minimum distance of those codes gives rise to a lower bound on the algebraic immunity of the associated vectorial function. Furthermore, we solve an open question raised by Mesnager and Cohen. We also present some properties of those cyclic codes (whose generator polynomials determined by vectorial functions) as well as their weight enumerator. In addition we generalize the so-called algebraic complement and study its properties.;cs.IT

1801.01149;Graph switching, 2-ranks, and graphical Hadamard matrices;We study the behaviour of the 2-rank of the adjacency matrix of a graph under Seidel and Godsil-McKay switching, and apply the result to graphs coming from graphical Hadamard matrices of order $4^m$. Starting with graphs from known Hadamard matrices of order $64$, we find (by computer) many Godsil-McKay switching sets that increase the 2-rank. Thus we find strongly regular graphs with parameters $(63,32,16,16)$, $(64,36,20,20)$, and $(64,28,12,12)$ for almost all feasible 2-ranks. In addition we work out the behaviour of the 2-rank for a graph product related to the Kronecker product for Hadamard matrices, which enables us to find many graphical Hadamard matrices of order $4^m$ for which the related strongly regular graphs have an unbounded number of different 2-ranks. The paper extends results from the article 'Switched symplectic graphs and their 2-ranks' by the first and the last author.;math.CO
1801.01161;Spherical bodies of constant width;The intersection $L$ of two different non-opposite hemispheres $G$ and $H$ of a $d$-dimensional sphere $S^d$ is called a lune. By the thickness of $L$ we mean the distance of the centers of the $(d-1)$-dimensional hemispheres bounding $L$. For a hemisphere $G$ supporting a %spherical convex body $C \subset S^d$ we define ${\rm width}_G(C)$ as the thickness of the narrowest lune or lunes of the form $G \cap H$ containing $C$. If ${\rm width}_G(C) =w$ for every hemisphere $G$ supporting $C$, we say that $C$ is a body of constant width $w$. We present properties of these bodies. In particular, we prove that the diameter of any spherical body $C$ of constant width $w$ on $S^d$ is $w$, and that if $w &lt, \frac{\pi}{2}$, then $C$ is strictly convex. Moreover, we are checking when spherical bodies of constant width and constant diameter coincide.;math.MG
1801.01165;Automorphism groups and Ramsey properties of sparse graphs;We study automorphism groups of sparse graphs from the viewpoint of topological dynamics and the Kechris, Pestov, Todor\v{c}evi\'c correspondence. We investigate amenable and extremely amenable subgroups of these groups using the space of orientations of the graph and results from structural Ramsey theory. Resolving one of the open questions in the area, we show that Hrushovski's example of an $\omega$-categorical sparse graph has no $\omega$-categorical expansion with extremely amenable automorphism group.;math.GR
1801.01167;Random Kleinian Groups, II : Two parabolic generators;In earlier work we introduced geometrically natural probability measures on the group of all M\"obius transformations in order to study "random" groups of M\"obius transformations, random surfaces, and in particular random two-generator groups, that is groups where the generators are selected randomly, with a view to estimating the likely-hood that such groups are discrete and then to make calculations of the expectation of their associated parameters, geometry and topology. In this paper we continue that study and identify the precise probability that a Fuchsian group generated by two parabolic M\"obius transformations is discrete, and give estimates for the case of Kleinian groups generated by a pair of random parabolic elements which we support with a computational investigation into of the Riley slice as identified by Bowditch's condition, and establish rigorous bounds.;math.CV
1801.01170;Optimization-based AMP for Phase Retrieval: The Impact of Initialization and $\ell_2$-regularization;We consider an $\ell_2$-regularized non-convex optimization problem for recovering signals from their noisy phaseless observations. We design and study the performance of a message passing algorithm that aims to solve this optimization problem. We consider the asymptotic setting $m,n \rightarrow \infty$, $m/n \rightarrow \delta$ and obtain sharp performance bounds, where $m$ is the number of measurements and $n$ is the signal dimension. We show that for complex signals the algorithm can perform accurate recovery with only $m= \left(\frac{64}{\pi^2}-4\right)n \approx 2.5n$ measurements. Also, we provide sharp analysis on the sensitivity of the algorithm to noise. We highlight the following facts about our message passing algorithm: (i) Adding $\ell_2$ regularization to the non-convex loss function can be beneficial. (ii) Spectral initialization has marginal impact on the performance of the algorithm. The sharp analyses in this paper, not only enable us to compare the performance of our method with other phase recovery schemes, but also shed light on designing better iterative algorithms for other non-convex optimization problems.;cs.IT
1801.01184;A note on the problem of prisoners and hats;We study the famous mathematical puzzle of prisoners and hats.

1801.01186;Explicit expression for a family of ternary cyclotomic polynomials;In this paper, we give an explicit expression for a certain family of ternary cyclotomic polynomials: specifically $\Phi_{p_{1}p_{2}p_{3}}$, where $p_{1}&lt,p_{2}&lt,p_{3}$ are odd primes such that $p_{2} \equiv1 \mod p_{1}$ and $p_{3} \equiv1 \mod {p_{1}p_{2}}$. As an application of the explicit expressions, we give an exact formula for the number of nonzero terms in the polynomials in the family, which in turn immediately shows that the density (number of non-zeros terms / degree) is roughly inversely proportional to $p_{2}$, when $p_{1}$ is sufficiently large.;math.NT
1801.01187;The geometry of Gauss map and shape operator in simply isotropic and pseudo-isotropic spaces;In this work, we are interested in the differential geometry of surfaces in simply isotropic $\mathbb{I}^3$ and pseudo-isotropic $\mathbb{I}_{\mathrm{p}}^3$ spaces, which consists of the study of $\mathbb{R}^3$ equipped with a degenerate metric such as $\mathrm{d}s^2=\mathrm{d}x^2\pm\mathrm{d}y^2$. The investigation is based on previous results in the simply isotropic space [B. Pavkovi\'c, Glas. Mat. Ser. III $\mathbf{15}$, 149 (1980), Rad JAZU $\mathbf{450}$, 129 (1990)], which point to the possibility of introducing an isotropic Gauss map taking values on a unit sphere of parabolic type and of defining a shape operator from it, whose determinant and trace give the known relative Gaussian and mean curvatures, respectively. Based on the isotropic Gauss map, a new notion of connection is also introduced, the \emph{relative connection} (\emph{r-connection}, for short). We show that the new curvature tensor in both $\mathbb{I}^3$ and $\mathbb{I}_{\mathrm{p}}^3$ does not vanish identically and is directly related to the relative Gaussian curvature. We also compute the Gauss and Codazzi-Mainardi equations for the $r$-connection and show that $r$-geodesics on spheres of parabolic type are obtained via intersections with planes passing through their center (focus). Finally, we show that admissible pseudo-isotropic surfaces are timelike and that their shape operator may fail to be diagonalizable, in analogy to Lorentzian geometry. We also prove that the only totally umbilical surfaces in $\mathbb{I}_{\mathrm{p}}^3$ are planes and spheres of parabolic type and that, in contrast to the $r$-connection, the curvature tensor associated with the isotropic Levi-Civita connection vanishes identically for $any$ pseudo-isotropic surface, as also happens in simply isotropic space.;math.DG
1801.01188;A new proof of Raynaud-Gruson&#x27,s flattening theorem;We give a new proof of Raynaud-Gruson's theorem regarding flattening by blow-ups. The proof is direct, by working directly on the inverse limit of admissible blow-ups, which is a valuative space similar to the classical Zariski-Riemann space. These valuative spaces are defined in a broader context and always have an analogous flattening property: this yields a generalization of Raynaud-Gruson's theorem.;math.AG
1801.01189;Hasse-Witt matrices, unit roots and period integrals;Motivated by the work of Candelas, de la Ossa and Rodriguez-Villegas [6], we study the relations between Hasse-Witt matrices and period integrals of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in both toric varieties and partial flag varieties. We prove a conjecture by Vlasenko [23] on higher Hasse-Witt matrices for toric hypersurfaces following Katz's method of local expansion [14, 15]. The higher Hasse-Witt matrices also have close relation with period integrals. The proof gives a way to pass from Katz's congruence relations in terms of expansion coefficients [15] to Dwork's congruence relations [8] about periods.;math.AG
1801.01194;Period integrals of local complete intersections and tautological systems;Tautological systems developed in [6],[7] are Picard-Fuchs type systems to study period integrals of complete intersections in Fano varieties. We generalize tautological systems to local complete intersections, which are zero loci of global sections of vector bundles over Fano varieties. In particular, we obtain similar criterion as [6, 7] about holonomicity and regularity of the system. We also prove solution rank formulas and geometric realizations of solutions following the work of hypersurfaces [5, 4].;math.AG
1801.01201;Concurrent Implicit Spectral Deferred Correction Scheme for Low-Mach Number Combustion with Detailed Chemistry;We present a parallel implicit-explicit time integration scheme for the advection-diffusion-reaction systems arising from the equations governing low-Mach number combustion with complex chemistry. Our strategy employs parallelization across the method to accelerate the serial Multi-Implicit Spectral Deferred Correction (MISDC) scheme used to couple the advection, diffusion, and reaction processes. In our approach, referred to as Concurrent Implicit Spectral Deferred Correction (CISDC), the diffusion solves and the reaction solves are performed concurrently by different processors. Our analysis shows that the proposed parallel scheme is stable for stiff problems and that the sweeps converge to the fixed-point solution at a faster rate than with serial MISDC. We present numerical examples to demonstrate that the new algorithm is high-order accurate in time, and achieves a parallel speedup compared to serial MISDC.;math.NA
1801.01206;Radial basis function collocation method for decoupled fractional Laplacian wave equations;Decoupled fractional Laplacian wave equation can describe the seismic wave propagation in attenuating media. Fourier pseudospectral implementations, which solve the equation in spatial frequency domain, are the only existing methods for solving the equation. For the earth media with curved boundaries, the pseudospectral methods could be less attractive to handle the irregular computational domains. In the paper, we propose a radial basis function collocation method that can easily tackle the irregular domain problems. Unlike the pseudospectral methods, the proposed method solves the equation in physical variable domain. The directional fractional Laplacian is chosen from varied definitions of fractional Laplacian. Particularly, the vector Gr\"unwald-Letnikov formula is employed to approximate fractional directional derivative of radial basis function. The convergence and stability of the method are numerically investigated by using the synthetic solution and the long-time simulations, respectively. The method's flexibility is studied by considering homogeneous and multi-layer media having regular and irregular geometric boundaries.;math.NA
1801.01208;Binary Extended Formulations;We analyze different ways of constructing binary extended formulations of mixed-integer problems with bounded integer variables and compare their relative strength with respect to split cuts. We show that among all binary extended formulations where each bounded integer variable is represented by a distinct collection of binary variables, what we call "unimodular" extended formulations are the strongest. We also compare the strength of some binary extended formulations from the literature. Finally, we study the behavior of branch-and-bound on such extended formulations and show that branching on the new binary variables leads to significantly smaller enumeration trees in some cases.;math.OC
1801.01216;Absolutely compatible pairs in a von Neumann algebra;Let $a,b$ be elements in a unital C$^*$-algebra with $0\leq a,b\leq 1$. The element $a$ is absolutely compatible with $b$ if $$\vert a - b \vert + \vert 1 - a - b \vert = 1.$$ In this note we find some technical characterizations of absolutely compatible pairs in an arbitrary von Neumann algebra. These characterizations are applied to measure how close is a pair of absolute compatible positive elements in the closed unit ball from being orthogonal or commutative. In the case of 2 by 2 matrices the results offer a geometric interpretation in terms of an ellipsoid determined by one of the points. The conclusions for 2 by 2 matrices are also applied to describe absolutely compatible pairs of positive elements in the closed unit ball of $\mathbb{M}_n$.;math.OA
1801.01219;The distribution of overlaps between eigenvectors of Ginibre matrices;We study the overlaps between eigenvectors of nonnormal matrices. They quantify the stability of the spectrum, and characterize the joint eigenvalues increments under Dyson-type dynamics. Well known work by Chalker and Mehlig calculated the expectation of these overlaps for complex Ginibre matrices. For the same model, we extend their results by deriving the distribution of diagonal overlaps (the condition numbers), and their correlations. We prove: <br />(i) convergence of condition numbers for bulk eigenvalues to an inverse Gamma distribution, more generally, we decompose the quenched overlap (i.e. conditioned on eigenvalues) as a product of independent random variables, <br />(ii) asymptotic expectation of off-diagonal overlaps, both for microscopic or mesoscopic separation of the corresponding eigenvalues, <br />(iii) decorrelation of condition numbers associated to eigenvalues at mesoscopic distance, at polynomial speed in the dimension, <br />(iv) second moment asymptotics to identify the fluctuations order for off-diagonal overlaps, when the related eigenvalues are separated by any mesoscopic scale, <br />(v) a new formula for the correlation between overlaps for eigenvalues at microscopic distance, both diagonal and off-diagonal. <br />These results imply estimates on the extreme condition numbers, the volume of the pseudospectrum and the diffusive evolution of eigenvalues under Dyson-type dynamics, at equilibrium.;math.PR
1801.01221;Bounded-Velocity Stochastic Control for Dynamic Resource Allocation;We consider a general class of dynamic resource allocation problems within a stochastic optimal control framework. This class of problems arises in a wide variety of applications, each of which intrinsically involves resources of different types and demand with uncertainty and/or variability. The goal involves dynamically allocating capacity for every resource type in order to serve the uncertain/variable demand, modeled as Brownian motion, and maximize the discounted expected net-benefit over an infinite time horizon based on the rewards and costs associated with the different resource types, subject to flexibility constraints on the rate of change of each type of resource capacity. We derive the optimal control policy within a bounded-velocity stochastic control setting, which includes efficient and easily implementable algorithms for governing the dynamic adjustments to resource allocation capacities over time. Computational experiments investigate various issues of both theoretical and practical interest, quantifying the benefits of our approach over recent alternative optimization approaches.;math.OC

1801.01236;Multistep Neural Networks for Data-driven Discovery of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems;The process of transforming observed data into predictive mathematical models of the physical world has always been paramount in science and engineering. Although data is currently being collected at an ever-increasing pace, devising meaningful models out of such observations in an automated fashion still remains an open problem. In this work, we put forth a machine learning approach for identifying nonlinear dynamical systems from data. Specifically, we blend classical tools from numerical analysis, namely the multi-step time-stepping schemes, with powerful nonlinear function approximators, namely deep neural networks, to distill the mechanisms that govern the evolution of a given data-set. We test the effectiveness of our approach for several benchmark problems involving the identification of complex, nonlinear and chaotic dynamics, and we demonstrate how this allows us to accurately learn the dynamics, forecast future states, and identify basins of attraction. In particular, we study the Lorenz system, the fluid flow behind a cylinder, the Hopf bifurcation, and the Glycoltic oscillator model as an example of complicated nonlinear dynamics typical of biological systems.;math.DS
1801.01238;Topological Entropy for Discontinuous Semiflows;We study two variations of Bowen's definitions of topological entropy based on separated and spanning sets which can be applied to the study of discontinuous semiflows on compact metric spaces. We prove that these definitions reduce to Bowen's ones in the case of continuous semiflows. As a second result, we prove that our entropies give a lower bound for the $\tau$-entropy defined by Alves, Carvalho and V\'asquez (2015). Finally, we prove that for impulsive semiflows satisfying certain regularity condition, there exists a continuous semiflow defined on another compact metric space which is related to the first one by a semiconjugation, and whose topological entropy equals our extended notion of topological entropy by using separated sets for the original semiflow.;math.DS
1801.01240;The distance to square-free polynomials;In this paper, we consider a variant of Tur\'an's problem on the distance from an integer polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ to the nea\-rest irreducible polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$. We prove that for any polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$, there exist infinitely many square-free polynomials $g\in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ such that $L(f-g) \le 2$, where $L(f-g)$ denotes the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of $f-g$. On the other hand, we show that this inequality cannot be replaced by $L(f-g) \le 1$. For this, for each integer $d \geq 16$ we construct infinitely many polynomials $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ of degree $d$ such that neither $f$ itself nor any $f(x) \pm x^k$, where $k$ is a non-negative integer, is square-free. Polynomials over prime fields and their distances to square-free polynomials are also considered.;math.NT
1801.01241;On the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in presence of a background shear;In this note we revisit the classical subject of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in presence of an incompressible background shear flow. We derive a formula for the essential spectral radius of the evolution group generated by the linearization near the steady state and reveal that the velocity variations neutralize shortwave instabilities. The formula is a direct generalization of the result of H. J. Hwang and Y. Guo in the hydrostatic case \cite{HG}. Furthermore, we construct a class of steady states which posses unstable discrete spectrum with neutral essential spectrum. The technique involves the WKB analysis of the evolution equation and contains novel compactness criterion for pseudo-differential operators on unbounded domains.;math.AP
1801.01249;Cooperative Ambient Backscatter Communications for Green Internet-of-Things;Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables a passive backscatter device to transmit information to a reader using ambient RF signals, and has emerged as a promising solution to green Internet-of-Things (IoT). Conventional AmBC receivers are interested in recovering the information from the ambient backscatter device (A-BD) only. In this paper, we propose a cooperative AmBC (CABC) system in which the reader recovers information not only from the A-BD, but also from the RF source. We first establish the system model for the CABC system from spread spectrum and spectrum sharing perspectives. Then, for flat fading channels, we derive the optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) detector, suboptimal linear detectors as well as successive interference-cancellation (SIC) based detectors. For frequency-selective fading channels, the system model for the CABC system over ambient orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) carriers is proposed, upon which a low-complexity optimal ML detector is derived. For both kinds of channels, the bit-error-rate (BER) expressions for the proposed detectors are derived in closed forms. Finally, extensive numerical results have shown that, when the A-BD signal and the RF-source signal have equal symbol period, the proposed SIC-based detectors can achieve near-ML detection performance for typical application scenarios, and when the A-BD symbol period is longer than the RF-source symbol period, the existence of backscattered signal in the CABC system can enhance the ML detection performance of the RF-source signal, thanks to the beneficial effect of the backscatter link when the A-BD transmits at a lower rate than the RF source.;cs.IT
1801.01251;Period integral of open Fermat surfaces and special values of hypergeometric functions;In the previous paper by Asakura-Otsubo-Terasoma, we prove that the special values of the hypergeometric function 3F2 at 1 are linear combinations of logarithms of algebraic numbers and 1 over algebraic numbers, if exponents are rational numbers satisfying a certain arithmetic condition. Aoki and Shioda completely classified these sets of rational numbers satisfying this condition in connection with Hodge cycles on Fermat surfaces. In this paper, we give an explicit expression of special values of hypergoemetricy 3F2 which does not belong to exceptional characters.;math.AG
1801.01252;A linearized energy preserving finite element method for the dynamical incompressible magnetohydrodynamics equations;We present and analyze a linearized finite element method (FEM) for the dynamical incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The finite element approximation is based on mixed conforming elements, where Taylor--Hood type elements are used for the Navier--Stokes equations and Nedelec edge elements are used for the magnetic equation. The divergence free conditions are weakly satisfied at the discrete level. Due to the use of Nedelec edge element, the proposed method is particularly suitable for problems defined on non-smooth and multi-connected domains. For the temporal discretization, we use a linearized scheme which only needs to solve a linear system at each time step. Moreover, the linearized mixed FEM is energy preserving. We establish an optimal error estimate under a very low assumption on the exact solutions and domain geometries. Numerical results which includes a benchmark lid-driven cavity problem are provided to show its effectiveness and verify the theoretical analysis.;math.NA
1801.01256;A scaling limit from the wave map to the heat flow into $\mathbb{S}^2$;In this paper we study a limit connecting a scaled wave map with the heat flow into the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$. We show quantitatively how that the two equations are connected by means of an initial layer correction. This limit is motivated as a first step into understanding the limit of zero inertia for the hyperbolic-parabolic Ericksen-Leslie's liquid crystal model.;math.AP
1801.01265;Improved Bounds on Lossless Source Coding and Guessing Moments via R&#xe9,nyi Measures;This paper provides upper and lower bounds on the optimal guessing moments of a random variable taking values on a finite set when side information may be available. These moments quantify the number of guesses required for correctly identifying the unknown object and, similarly to Arikan's bounds, they are expressed in terms of the Arimoto-R\'enyi conditional entropy. Although Arikan's bounds are asymptotically tight, the improvement of the bounds in this paper is significant in the non-asymptotic regime. Relationships between moments of the optimal guessing function and the MAP error probability are also established, characterizing the exact locus of their attainable values. The bounds on optimal guessing moments serve to improve non-asymptotic bounds on the cumulant generating function of the codeword lengths for fixed-to-variable optimal lossless source coding without prefix constraints. Non-asymptotic bounds on the reliability function of discrete memoryless sources are derived as well. Relying on these techniques, lower bounds on the cumulant generating function of the codeword lengths are derived, by means of the smooth R\'enyi entropy, for source codes that allow decoding errors.;cs.IT
1801.01268;Asymptotic Faithfulness of Quantum $\mathrm{Sp}(4)$ Mapping Class Group Representations;We prove asymptotic faithfulness for the quantum $\mathrm{Sp}(4)$ mapping class group representation. This provides the first example of asymptotic faithfulness lying outside of the $A_n$ family. The methods used are generalized from the proof of asymptotic faithfulness for skein $SU(2)_k$ mapping class group representations. In short, for any noncentral mapping class a comparison vector is found which allows for the mapping class to be detected.;math.QA
1801.01270;Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Wireless Communication: Tail, Risk and Scale;Ensuring ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) for 5G wireless networks and beyond is of capital importance and is currently receiving tremendous attention in academia and industry. At its core, URLLC mandates a departure from expected utility-based network design approaches, in which relying on average quantities (e.g., average throughput, average delay and average response time) is no longer an option but a necessity. Instead, a principled and scalable framework which takes into account delay, reliability, packet size, network architecture, and topology (across access, edge, and core) and decision-making under uncertainty is sorely lacking. The overarching goal of this article is a first step to fill this void. Towards this vision, after providing definitions of latency and reliability, we closely examine various enablers of URLLC and their inherent tradeoffs. Subsequently, we focus our attention on a plethora of techniques and methodologies pertaining to the requirements of ultra-reliable and low-latency communication, as well as their applications through selected use cases. These results provide crisp insights for the design of low-latency and high-reliable wireless networks.;cs.IT
1801.01271;On division subrings normalized by almost subnormal subgroups in division rings;Let $D$ be a division ring with infinite center, $K$ a proper division subring of $D$ and $N$ an almost subnormal subgroup of the multiplicative group $D^*$ of $D$. The aim of this paper is to show that if $K$ is $N$-invariant and $N$ is non-central, then $K$ is central. Some examples of almost subnormal subgroups in division rings that are not subnormal are also given.;math.RA
1801.01282;Minimal convex majorants of functions and Demyanov--Rubinov super(sub)differentials;The primary goal of the paper is to establish characteristic properties of (extended) real-valued functions defined on normed vector spaces that admit the representation as the lower envelope of their minimal (with respect to pointwise ordering) convex majorants. The results presented in the paper generalize and extend the well-known Demyanov-Rubinov characterization of upper semicontinuous positively homogeneous functions as the lower envelope of exhaustive families of continuous sublinear functions to more larger classes of (not necessarily positively homogeneous) functions defined on arbitrary normed spaces. As applications of the above results, we introduce, for nonsmooth functions, a new notion of the Demyanov-Rubinov subdifferential at a given point, and show that it generalizes a number of known notions of subdifferentiability, in particular, the Fenchel-Moreau subdifferential of convex functions and the Dini-Hadamard (directional) subdifferential of directionally differentiable functions. Some applications of Demyanov-Rubinov subdifferentials to extremal problems are considered.;math.OC
1801.01283;Recursive combinatorial aspects of compactified moduli spaces;A connection between moduli spaces of algebro-geometric objects and moduli spaces of polyhedral objects has been under investigation in recent years. Loosely speaking, the skeleton of an algebro-geometric moduli space is expressed as the modul space of the skeleta of the objects it parametrizes. The connection is based on the combinatorial properties of the boundary of the algebro-geometric moduli spaces. This paper overviews this topic with focus on moduli of curves, admissible covers, Jacobians and their Neron models.;math.AG
1801.01284;Ergodic BSDE with an unbounded and multiplicative underlying diffusion and application to large time behavior of viscosity solution of HJB equation;In this paper, we study ergodic backward stochastic differential equations (EBSDEs for short), for which the underlying diffusion is assumed to be multiplicative and of at most linear growth. The fact that the forward process has an unbounded diffusion is balanced with an assumption of weak dissipativity for its drift. Moreover, the forward equation is assumed to be non-degenerate. Like in [HMR15], we show that the solution of a BSDE in finite horizon T behaves basically as a linear function of T, with a shift depending on the solution of the associated EBSDE, with an explicit rate of convergence. Finally, we apply our results to an ergodic optimal control problem. In particular, we show the large time behaviour of viscosity solution of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation with an exponential rate of convergence when the undelrying diffusion is multiplicative and unbounded.;math.PR
1801.01289;On sums of squares of $|&#x3b6,(\frac12+i&#x3b3,)|$ over short intervals;A discussion involving the evaluation of the sum $$\sum_{T&lt,\g\le T+H}|\zeta(1/2+i\gamma)|^2$$ and some related integrals is presented, where $\gamma\,(&gt,0)$ denotes imaginary parts of complex zeros of the Riemann zeta-function $\zeta(s)$. It is shown unconditionally that the above sum is $\,\ll H\log^2T\log\log T\,$ for $\,T^{2/3}\log^4T \ll H \le T$.;math.NT
1801.01292;Generic distance-squared mappings on plane curves;A distance-squared function is one of the most significant functions in the application of singularity theory to differential geometry. Moreover, distance-squared mappings are naturally extended mappings of distance-squared functions, wherein each component is a distance-squared function. In this paper, compositions of a given plane curve and generic distance-squared mappings on the plane into the plane are investigated from the viewpoint of stability.;math.DG
1801.01297;Another refinement of the right-hand side of the Hermite-Hadamard inequality for simplices;In this paper, we establish a new refinement of the right-hand side of Hermite-Hadamard inequality for convex functions of several variables defined on simplices.;math.CA
1801.01300;Heat and entropy flows in Carnot groups;We prove the correspondence between the solutions of the sub-elliptic heat equation in a Carnot group $\mathbb{G}$ and the gradient flows of the relative entropy functional in the Wasserstein space of probability measures on $\mathbb{G}$. Our result completely answers a question left open in a previous paper by N. Juillet, where the same correspondence was proved for $\mathbb{G}=\mathbb{H}^n$, the $n$-dimensional Heisenberg group.;math.DG
1801.01302;Isoperimetric rigidity and distributions of 1-Lipschitz functions;We prove that if a geodesic metric measure space satisfies a comparison condition for isoperimetric profile and if the observable variance is maximal, then the space is foliated by minimal geodesics, where the observable variance is defined to be the supremum of the variance of 1-Lipschitz functions on the space. Our result can be considered as a variant of Cheeger-Gromoll's splitting theorem and also of Cheng's maximal diameter theorem. As an application, we obtain a new isometric splitting theorem for a complete weighted Riemannian manifold with a positive Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature.;math.MG
1801.01309;The mathematics of asymptotic stability in the Kuramoto model;Now a standard in Nonlinear Sciences, the Kuramoto model is the perfect example of the transition to synchrony in heterogeneous systems of coupled oscillators. While its basic phenomenology has been sketched in early works, the corresponding rigorous validation has long remained problematic and was achieved only recently. This paper reviews the mathematical results on asymptotic stability of stationary solutions in the continuum limit of the Kuramoto model, and provides insights into the principal arguments of proofs. This review is complemented with additional original results, various examples, and possible extensions to some variations of the model in the literature.;math.AP
1801.01310;Validity of Borodin and Kostochka Conjecture for {4 Times K1}-free Graphs;Problem of finding an optimal upper bound for the chromatic no. of even 3K1-free graphs is still open and pretty hard. Here we prove Borodin &amp, Kostochka Conjecture for 4K1-free graphs G i.e. If maximum degree of a {4 Times K1}-free graph is greater than or equal to 9, then the chromatic number of the graph is less than or equal to maximum of {\omega} and {\delta-1}.;math.CO
1801.01313;Thinplate Splines on the Sphere;In this paper we give explicit closed forms for the semi-reproducing kernels associated with thinplate spline interpolation on the sphere. Polyharmonic or thinplate splines for ${\mathbb R}^d$ were introduced by Duchon and have become a widely used tool in myriad applications. The analogues for ${\mathbb S}^{d-1}$ are the thin plate splines for the sphere. The topic was first discussed by Wahba in the early 1980's, for the ${\mathbb S}^2$ case. Wahba presented the associated semi-reproducing kernels as infinite series. These semi-reproducing kernels play a central role in expressions for the solution of the associated spline interpolation and smoothing problems. The main aims of the current paper are to give a recurrence for the semi-reproducing kernels, and also to use the recurrence to obtain explicit closed form expressions for many of these kernels. The closed form expressions will in many cases be significantly faster to evaluate than the series expansions. This will enhance the practicality of using these thinplate splines for the sphere in computations.;math.CA
1801.01318;S-regular functions which preserve a complex slice;We study global properties of quaternionic slice regular functions (also called s-regular) defined on symmetric slice domains. In particular, thanks to new techniques and points of view, we can characterize the property of being one-slice preserving in terms of the projectivization of the vectorial part of the function. We also define a "Hermitian" product on slice regular functions which gives us the possibility to express the $*$-product of two s-regular functions in terms of the scalar product of suitable functions constructed starting from $f$ and $g$. Afterwards we are able to determine, under different assumptions, when the sum, the $*$-product and the $*$-conjugation of two slice regular functions preserve a complex slice. We also study when the $*$-power of a slice regular function has this property or when it preserves all complex slices. To obtain these results we prove two factorization theorems: in the first one, we are able to split a slice regular function into the product of two functions: one keeping track of the zeroes and the other which is never-vanishing, in the other one we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a slice regular function (which preserves all complex slices) to be the symmetrized of a suitable slice regular one.;math.CV
1801.01327;Frobenius Theorem in Banach Space;Let $\Lambda$ be an open set in Banach space $E$, $M(x)$ for $x\in \Lambda$ a subspace in $E$, and $\mathcal F=\{M(x)\}_{x\in\Lambda}$. In this paper, we introduce the concept of the co-final set $J(x_0,E_*)$ for $\mathcal F$ at $x_0\in \Lambda$, then prove Frobenius theorem in Banach space where especially, $\mathrm{dim}\, M(x)$ maybe $\infty$. Using the Frobenius theorem, we prove a theorem in advanced calulus that presents several $c^1$ integrable family $\mathcal F$ at a point with $\mathrm{dim}\, M(x) =\infty$ and trivial co-final set. Let $\Lambda=B(E,F)\setminus\{0\},\ M(X)=\{T\in B(E,F) : TN(X)\subset R(X)\}$, and $\mathcal F=\{M(X)\}_{X\in\Lambda}$. The following theorem is proved using Frobenius theorem: if $A\in\Lambda$ is double splitting, then $\mathcal F$ at $A$ is smooth integrable where $J(A,E_*)$ is non-trivial in general. Specially we have the global result as follows, let $\Phi$ be any one of $F_k(k&lt,\infty)$ and $\Phi_{m,n}(\min\{m,n\}&lt,\infty)$, then $\Phi$ is smooth submanifold in $B(E,F)$ and tangent to $M(X)$ at any $X$ in $\Phi$.;math.FA
1801.01328;Schurity and separability of quasiregular coherent configurations;A permutation group is said to be quasiregular if every its transitive constituent is regular, and a quasiregular coherent configuration can be thought as a combinatorial analog of such a group: the transitive constituents are replaced by the homogeneous components. In this paper, we are interested in the question when the configuration is schurian, i.e., formed by the orbitals of a permutation group, or/and separable, i.e., uniquely determined by the intersection numbers. In these terms, an old result of Hanna Neumann is, in a sense, dual to the statement that the quasiregular coherent configurations with cyclic homogeneous components are schurian. In the present paper, we (a) establish the duality in a precise form and (b) generalize the latter result by proving that a quasiregular coherent configuration is schurian and separable if the groups associated with homogeneous components have distributive lattices of normal subgroups.;math.CO
1801.01329;Bounded normal generation is not equivalent to topological bounded normal generation;We show that some derived $\mathrm{L}^1$ full groups provide examples of non simple Polish groups with the topological bounded normal generation property. In particular, it follows that there are Polish groups with the topological bounded normal generation property but not the bounded normal generation property.;math.GR

1801.01336;A family of multigraphs with large palette index;Given a proper edge-coloring of a loopless multigraph, the palette of a vertex is defined as the set of colors of the edges which are incident with it. The palette index of a multigraph is defined as the minimum number of distinct palettes occurring among the vertices, taken over all proper edge-colorings of the multigraph itself. In this framework, the palette multigraph of an edge-colored multigraph is defined in this paper and some of its properties are investigated. We show that these properties can be applied in a natural way in order to produce the first known family of multigraphs whose palette index is expressed in terms of the maximum degree by a quadratic polynomial. We also attempt an analysis of our result in connection with some related questions.;math.CO
1801.01338;Quantitative aspects of the rigidity of branching microstructures in shape memory alloys via H-measures;We quantify the rigidity of branching microstructures in shape memory alloys undergoing cubic-to-tetragonal transformations in the geometrically linearized theory by making use of Tartar's H-measures. The main result is a $B^{2/3}_{1,\infty}$-estimate for the characteristic functions of twins, which heuristically suggests that the larger-scale interfaces can cluster on a set of Hausdorff-dimension $3-\frac{2}{3}$. We provide evidence indicating that the dimension is optimal. Furthermore, we get an essentially local lower bound for the blow-up behavior of the limiting energy density close to a habit plane.;math.AP
1801.01339;On the application of the Lindstedt-Poincar&#xe9, method to the Lotka-Volterra system;We apply the Lindstedt-Poincar\'{e} method to the Lotka-Volterra model and discuss alternative implementations of the approach. By means of an efficient systematic algorithm we obtain an unprecedented number of perturbation corrections for the two dynamical variables and the frequency. They enable us to estimate the radius of convergence of the perturbation series for the frequency as a function of the only model parameter. The method is suitable for the treatment of systems with any number of dynamical variables.;math-ph
1801.01340;Random time step probabilistic methods for uncertainty quantification in chaotic and geometric numerical integration;A novel probabilistic numerical method for quantifying the uncertainty induced by the time integration of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is introduced. Departing from the classical strategy to randomize ODE solvers by adding a random forcing term, we show that a probability measure over the numerical solution of ODEs can be obtained by introducing suitable random time-steps in a classical time integrator. This intrinsic randomization allows for the conservation of geometric properties of the underlying deterministic integrator such as mass conservation, symplecticity or conservation of first integrals. Weak and mean-square convergence analysis are derived. We also analyse the convergence of the Monte Carlo estimator for the proposed random time step method and show that the measure obtained with repeated sampling converges in the mean-square sense independently of the number of samples. Numerical examples including chaotic Hamiltonian systems, chemical reactions and Bayesian inferential problems illustrate the accuracy, robustness and versatility of our probabilistic numerical method.;math.NA
1801.01345;De Branges spaces and Fock spaces;Relations between two classes of Hilbert spaces of entire functions, de Branges spaces and Fock-type spaces with non-radial weights, are studied. It is shown that any de Branges space can be realized as a Fock-type space with equivalent area norm, and several constructions of a representing weight are suggested. For some special classes of weights (e.g., weights depending on the imaginary part only) the corresponding de Branges spaces are explicitly described.;math.CV
1801.01346;Spectral properties of 2D Pauli operators with almost periodic electromagnetic fields;We consider a 2D Pauli operator with almost periodic field $b$ and electric potential $V$. First, we study the ergodic properties of $H$ and show, in particular, that its discrete spectrum is empty if there exists a magnetic potential which generates the magnetic field $b - b_{0}$, $b_{0}$ being the mean value of $b$. Next, we assume that $V = 0$, and investigate the zero modes of $H$. As expected, if $b_{0} \neq 0$, then generically $\operatorname{dim} \operatorname{Ker} H = \infty$. If $b_{0} = 0$, then for each $m \in {\mathbb N} \cup \{ \infty \}$, we construct almost periodic $b$ such that $\operatorname{dim} \operatorname{Ker} H = m$. This construction depends strongly on results concerning the asymptotic behavior of Dirichlet series, also obtained in the present article.;math.SP
1801.01347;Metaplectic Eisenstein Distributions;In this paper, we define distributional analogues of the metaplectic Eisenstein series for $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$, which we refer to as metaplectic Eisenstein distributions. We prove that these distributions have meromorphic continuation and give an explicit functional equation that they satisfy. From these results, we deduce the functional equation for the corresponding classical metaplectic Eisenstein series.;math.NT
1801.01352;Two-phase heat conductors with a surface of the constant flow property;We consider a two-phase heat conductor in $\mathbb R^N$ with $N \geq 2$ consisting of a core and a shell with different constant conductivities. We study the role played by radial symmetry for overdetermined problems of elliptic and parabolic type. First of all, with the aid of the implicit function theorem, we give a counterexample to radial symmetry for some two-phase elliptic overdetermined boundary value problems of Serrin-type. Afterwards, we consider the following setting for a two-phase parabolic overdetermined problem. We suppose that, initially, the conductor has temperature 0 and, at all times, its boundary is kept at temperature 1. A hypersurface in the domain has the constant flow property if at every of its points the heat flux across surface only depends on time. It is shown that the structure of the conductor must be spherical, if either there is a surface of the constant flow property in the shell near the boundary or a connected component of the boundary of the heat conductor is a surface of the constant flow property. Also, by assuming that the medium outside the conductor has a possibly different conductivity, we consider a Cauchy problem in which the conductor has initial inside temperature $0$ and outside temperature $1$. We then show that a quite similar symmetry result holds true.;math.AP
1801.01354;Ekedahl-Oort stratifications of Shimura varieties via Breuil-Kisin windows;Let $ S $ be the special fibre of the good reduction of a Shimura variety of Hodge type. By constructing adapted deformations for the associated $p$-divisible groups of $ S $, we manage to construct a morphism from $S$ to some quotient sheaf of the loop group associated with $S$. We show that the geometric fibres of this morphism give back the Ekedahl-Oort strata of $S$. For any geometric point $ x $ of $ S $, we give a deformation over $ W(k(x)) $ of the $ p $-divisible group associated with $ x $ by (non-canonically) constructing a Breuil-Kisin window (which corresponds to a $ p $-divisible group over $ W(k(x)) $ by the work of Kisin). This map in a sense gives a conceptual interpretation of Viehmann's new invariants "truncations of level one of elements in the loop group".;math.AG
1801.01360;Minimal Representations of Natural Numbers Under a Set of Operators;This paper studies the minimal length representation of the natural numbers. Let O be a fixed set of integer-valued functions (primarily hyperoperations). For each n, what is the shortest way of expressing n as a combinations of functions in O to the constant 1? For example, if O contains the two functions Sx (successor of x) and *xy (x times y) then the shortest representation of 12 is *SSS1SS1, with 8 symbols. This is taken to mean that 8 is complexity of 12 under O. We make a study of such minimal representations and complexities in this paper, proving and/or rightly predicting bounds on complexities, discussing some relevant patterns in the complexities and minimal representations of the natural numbers and listing the results gleaned from computational analysis. Computationally, the first 4.5 million natural numbers were probed to verify our mathematically obtained results. Due to the finiteness of the problem, we used the method of exhaustion of possibilities to state some other results as well.;math.HO

In this paper, the author considers the complete continuity on weighted $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ spaces with $A_p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ weights, weighted Morrey spaces with $A_p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ weights, for the commutator generated by ${\rm CMO}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ functions and $\mathcal{M}_{\Omega}$ when $\Omega$ satisfies certain size conditions.;math.CA
1801.01368;A simple property of the Weyl tensor for a shear, vorticity and acceleration-free velocity field;We prove that, in a space-time of dimension n&gt,3 with a velocity field that is shear-free, vorticity-free and acceleration-free, the covariant divergence of the Weyl tensor is zero if the contraction of the Weyl tensor with the velocity is zero. The other way, if the covariant divergence of the Weyl tensor is zero, then the contraction of the Weyl tensor with the velocity has recurrent geodesic derivative. This partly extends a property found in Generalised Robertson-Walker spacetimes, where the velocity is also eigenvector of the Ricci tensor. Despite the simplicity of the statement, the proof is involved. As a product of the same calculation, we introduce a curvature tensor with an interesting recurrence property.;math-ph

1801.01380;The cost of controlling strongly degenerate parabolic equations;We consider the typical one-dimensional strongly degenerate parabolic operator $Pu= u_t - (x^\alpha u_x)_x$ with $0&lt,x&lt,\ell$ and $\alpha\in(0,2)$, controlled either by a boundary control acting at $x=\ell$, or by a locally distributed control. Our main goal is to study the dependence of the so-called controllability cost needed to drive an initial condition to rest with respect to the degeneracy parameter $\alpha$. We prove that the control cost blows up with an explicit exponential rate, as $e^{C/((2-\alpha)^2 T)}$, when $\alpha \to 2^-$ and/or $T\to 0^+$. <br />Our analysis builds on earlier results and methods (based on functional analysis and complex analysis techniques) developed by several authors such as Fattorini-Russel, Seidman, G\"uichal, Tenenbaum-Tucsnak and Lissy for the classical heat equation. In particular, we use the moment method and related constructions of suitable biorthogonal families, as well as new fine properties of the Bessel functions $J_\nu$ of large order $\nu$ (obtained by ordinary differential equations techniques).;math.OC
1801.01381;Graph Homologies and Functoriality;We follow the same technics we used before in \cite{AZ} of extending knot Floer homology to embedded graphs in a 3-manifold, by using the Kauffman topological invariant of embedded graphs by associating family of links and knots to a such graph by using some local replacements at each vertex in the graph. This new concept of Graph Floer homology constructed to be the sum of the knot Floer homologies of all the links and knots associated to this graph and the Euler characteristic is the sum of all the Alexander polynomials of links in the family. We constructed three pre-additive categories one for the graph under the cobordism and the other one is constructed in \cite{AMM} the last one is a category of Floer homologies for graph defined by Kauffman. Then we trying to study the functoriality of graphs category and their graph homologies in two ways, under cobordism and under branched cover, then we try to find the compatibility between them by the idea of Hilden and Little \cite{HL} by giving a notion of equivalence relation of branched coverings obtained by using cobordisms, and hence define a a functor from the graph Floer-Kauffman Homology category to the graph Khovanov-Kauffman Homology category.;math.AT
1801.01382;Logarithmic Bose-Einstein condensates with harmonic potential;In this paper, by using a compactness method, we study the Cauchy problem of the logarithmic Schr\"{o}dinger equation with harmonic potential. We then address the existence of ground states solutions as minimizers of the action on the Nehari manifold. Finally, we explicitly compute ground states (Gausson-type solution) and we show their orbital stability.;math.AP
1801.01384;Holomorphic Structure of Middle Bol Loops;A loop $(Q,\cdot,\backslash,/)$ is called a middle Bol loop if it obeys the identity $x(yz\backslash x)=(x/z)(y\backslash x)$. To every right (left) Bol loop corresponds a middle Bol loop via an isostrophism. In this paper, the structure of the holomorph of a middle Bol loop is explored. For some special types of automorphisms, the holomorph of a commutative loop is shown to be a commutative middle Bol loop if and only if the loop is a middle Bol loop and its automorphism group is abelian and a subgroup of both the group of middle regular mappings and the right multiplication group. It was found that commutativity (flexibility) is a necessary and sufficient condition for holomorphic invariance under the existing isostrophy between middle Bol loops and the corresponding right (left) Bol loops. The right combined holomorph of a middle Bol loop and its corresponding right (left) Bol loop was shown to be equal to the holomorph of the middle Bol loop if and only if the automorphism group is abelian and a subgroup of the multiplication group of the middle Bol loop. The obedience of an identity dependent on automorphisms was found to be a necessary and sufficient condition the left combined holomorph of a middle Bol loop and its corresponding left Bol loop to be equal to the holomorph of the middle Bol loop.;math.GR
1801.01386;On Enriched Fibrations;We introduce the notion of an enriched fibration, i.e. a fibration whose total category and base category are enriched in those of a monoidal fibration in an appropriate way. Furthermore, we provide a way to obtain such a structure, starting from actions of monoidal categories with parameterized adjoints. The motivating goal is to capture certain example cases, like the fibration of modules over algebras enriched in the opfibration of comodules over coalgebras.;math.CT
1801.01389;Bogoliubov Theory in the Gross-Pitaevskii Limit;We consider Bose gases consisting of $N$ particles trapped in a box with volume one and interacting through a repulsive potential with scattering length of the order $N^{-1}$(Gross-Pitaevskii regime). We determine the ground state energy and the low-energy excitation spectrum, up to errors vanishing as $N \to \infty$. Our results confirm Bogoliubov's predictions.;math-ph
1801.01392;Lebesgue type decompositions for linear relations and Ando&#x27,s uniqueness criterion;A linear relation, i.e., a multivalued operator $T$ from a Hilbert space ${\mathfrak H}$ to a Hilbert space ${\mathfrak K}$ has Lebesgue type decompositions $T=T_{1}+T_{2}$, where $T_{1}$ is a closable operator and $T_{2}$ is an operator or relation which is singular. There is one canonical decomposition, called the Lebesgue decomposition of $T$, whose closable part is characterized by its maximality among all closable parts in the sense of domination. All Lebesgue type decompositions are parametrized, which also leads to necessary and sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of such decompositions. Similar results are given for weak Lebesgue type decompositions, where $T_1$ is just an operator without being necessarily closable. Moreover, closability is characterized in different useful ways. In the special case of range space relations the above decompositions may be applied when dealing with pairs of (nonnegative) bounded operators and nonnegative forms as well as in the classical framework of positive measures.;math.FA
1801.01393;Codegree Tur&#xe1,n density of complete $r$-uniform hypergraphs;Let $r\ge 3$. Given an $r$-graph $H$, the minimum codegree $\delta_{r-1}(H)$ is the largest integer $t$ such that every $(r-1)$-subset of $V(H)$ is contained in at least $t$ edges of $H$. Given an $r$-graph $F$, the codegree Tur\'an density $\gamma(F)$ is the smallest $\gamma &gt,0$ such that every $r$-graph on $n$ vertices with $\delta_{r-1}(H)\ge (\gamma + o(1))n$ contains $F$ as a subhypergraph. Using results on the independence number of hypergraphs, we show that there are constants $c_1, c_2&gt,0$ depending only on $r$ such that \[ 1 - c_2 \frac{\ln t}{t^{r-1}} \le \gamma(K_t^r) \le 1 - c_1 \frac{\ln t}{t^{r-1}}, \] where $K_t^r$ is the complete $r$-graph on $t$ vertices. This gives the best general bounds for $\gamma(K_t^r)$.;math.CO
1801.01394;Prediction Error Bounds for Linear Regression With the TREX;The TREX is a recently introduced approach to sparse linear regression. In contrast to most well-known approaches to penalized regression, the TREX can be formulated without the use of tuning parameters. In this paper, we establish the first known prediction error bounds for the TREX. Additionally, we introduce extensions of the TREX to a more general class of penalties, and we provide a bound on the prediction error in this generalized setting. These results deepen the understanding of TREX from a theoretical perspective and provide new insights into penalized regression in general.;math.ST
1801.01412;Operator scaling with specified marginals;The completely positive maps, a generalization of the nonnegative matrices, are a well-studied class of maps from $n\times n$ matrices to $m\times m$ matrices. The existence of the operator analogues of doubly stochastic scalings of matrices is equivalent to a multitude of problems in computer science and mathematics, such rational identity testing in non-commuting variables, noncommutative rank of symbolic matrices, and a basic problem in invariant theory (Garg, Gurvits, Oliveira and Wigderson, FOCS, 2016). <br />We study operator scaling with specified marginals, which is the operator analogue of scaling matrices to specified row and column sums. We characterize the operators which can be scaled to given marginals, much in the spirit of the Gurvits' algorithmic characterization of the operators that can be scaled to doubly stochastic (Gurvits, Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 2004). Our algorithm produces approximate scalings in time poly(n,m) whenever scalings exist. A central ingredient in our analysis is a reduction from the specified marginals setting to the doubly stochastic setting. <br />Operator scaling with specified marginals arises in diverse areas of study such as the Brascamp-Lieb inequalities, communication complexity, eigenvalues of sums of Hermitian matrices, and quantum information theory. Some of the known theorems in these areas, several of which had no effective proof, are straightforward consequences of our characterization theorem. For instance, we obtain a simple algorithm to find, when they exist, a tuple of Hermitian matrices with given spectra whose sum has a given spectrum. We also prove new theorems such as a generalization of Forster's theorem (Forster, Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 2002) concerning radial isotropic position.;math.CO
1801.01417;Minimization of the eigenvalues of the dirichlet-laplacian with a diameter constraint;In this paper we look for the domains minimizing the h-th eigenvalue of the Dirichlet-Laplacian $\lambda$ h with a constraint on the diameter. Existence of an optimal domain is easily obtained, and is attained at a constant width body. In the case of a simple eigenvalue, we provide non standard (i.e., non local) optimality conditions. Then we address the question whether or not the disk is an optimal domain in the plane, and we give the precise list of the 17 eigenvalues for which the disk is a local minimum. We conclude by some numerical simulations showing the 20 first optimal domains in the plane.;math.AP
1801.01418;Quantitative estimates for bending energies and applications to non-local variational problems;We discuss a variational model, given by a weighted sum of perimeter, bending and Riesz interaction energies, that could be considered as a toy model for charged elastic drops. The different contributions have competing preferences for strongly localized and maximally dispersed structures. We investigate the energy landscape in dependence of the size of the 'charge', i.e. the weight of the Riesz interaction energy. In the two-dimensional case we first prove that for simply connected sets of small elastic energy, the elastic deficit controls the isoperimetric deficit. Building on this result, we show that for small charge the only minimizers of the full variational model are either balls or centered annuli. We complement these statements by a non-existence result for large charge. In three dimensions, we prove area and diameter bounds for configurations with small Willmore energy and show that balls are the unique minimizers of our variational model for sufficiently small charge.;math.AP
1801.01428;A Phase Transition in a Widom-Rowlinson Model with Curie-Weiss Interaction;An analog of the continuum Widom-Rowlinson model is introduced and studied. Its two-component version is a gas of point particles of types 0 and 1 placed in $\mathds{R}^d$, in which like particles do not interact and unlike particles contained in a vessel of volume $V$ repel each other with intensity $a/V$. The one-component version is a gas of particles with multi-particle interactions of Curie-Weiss type. Its thermodynamic behavior is obtained by integrating out the coordinates of one of the components of the two-component version. In the grand canonical setting, a rigorous theory of phase transitions in this model is developed and discussed. In particular, for both versions thermodynamic phases and phase diagrams are explicitly constructed and the equations of state are obtained and analyzed.;math-ph
1801.01429;Cohomological Hall algebras for Higgs torsion sheaves, moduli of triples and sheaves on surfaces;For any free oriented Borel-Moore homology theory $A$, we construct an associative product on the $A$-theory of the stack of Higgs torsion sheaves over a projective curve $C$. We show that the resulting algebra $A\mathbf{Ha}_C^0$ admits a natural shuffle presentation, and prove it is faithful when $A$ is replaced with usual Borel-Moore homology groups. We also introduce moduli spaces of stable triples, heavily inspired by Nakajima quiver varieties, whose $A$-theory admits an $A\mathbf{Ha}_C^0$-action. These triples can be interpreted as certain sheaves on $\mathbb P(T^*C)$. In particular, we obtain an action of $A\mathbf{Ha}_C^0$ on the cohomology of Hilbert schemes of points on $T^*C$.;math.RT
1801.01438;On the class of flat stable theories;A new notion of independence relation is given and associated to it, the class of flat theories, a subclass of strong stable theories including the superstable ones is introduced. More precisely, after introducing this independence relation, flat theories are defined as an appropriate version of superstability. It is shown that in a flat theory every type has finite weight and therefore flat theories are strong. Furthermore, it is shown that under reasonable conditions any type is non-orthogonal to a regular one. Concerning groups in flat theories, it is shown that type-definable groups behave like superstable ones, since they satisfy the same chain condition on definable subgroups and also admit a normal series of definable subgroup with semi-regular quotients.;math.LO
1801.01440;Arboreal Cantor actions;In this paper, we consider minimal equicontinuous actions of discrete countably generated groups on Cantor sets, obtained from the arboreal representations of absolute Galois groups of fields. In particular, we study the asymptotic discriminant of these actions. <br />The asymptotic discriminant is an invariant obtained by restricting the action to a sequence of nested clopen sets, and studying the isotropies of the enveloping group actions in such restricted systems. An enveloping (Ellis) group of such an action is a profinite group. <br />A large class of actions of profinite groups on Cantor sets is given by arboreal representations of absolute Galois groups of fields. We show how to associate to an arboreal representation an action of a discrete group, and give examples of arboreal representations with stable and wild asymptotic discriminant.;math.DS
1801.01448;A Beurling-Chen-Hadwin-Shen Theorem for Noncommutative Hardy Spaces Associated with Semifinite von Neumann Algebras with Unitarily Invariant Norms;We introduce a class of unitarily invariant, locally $\|\cdot\|_1$-dominating, mutually continuous norms with repect to $\tau$ on a von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{M}$ with a faithful, normal, semifinite tracial weight $\tau$. We prove a Beurling-Chen-Hadwin-Shen theorem for $H^\infty$-invariant spaces of $L^\alpha(\mathcal{M},\tau)$, where $\alpha$ is a unitarily invariant, locally $\|\cdot\|_1$-dominating, mutually continuous norm with respect to $\tau$, and $H^\infty$ is an extension of Arveson's noncommutative Hardy space. We use our main result to characterize the $H^\infty$-invariant subspaces of a noncommutative Banach function space $\mathcal I(\tau)$ with the norm $\|\cdot\|_{E }$ on $\mathcal{M}$, the crossed product of a semifinite von Neumann algebra by an action $\beta$, and $B(\mathcal{H})$ for a separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$.;math.OA
1801.01457;Biharmonic functions on spheres and hyperbolic spaces;We construct new explicit proper r-harmonic functions on the standard n-dimensional sphere S^n and hyperbolic space H^n for any r\ge 1 and n\ge 2.;math.DG
1801.01460;Hyperbolicity and bifurcations in holomorphic families of polynomial skew products;We initiate a parametric study of holomorphic families of polynomial skew products, i.e., polynomial endomorphisms of $\mathbb{C}^2$ of the form $F(z,w)= (p(z), q(z,w))$ that extend to holomorphic endomorphisms of $\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{C})$. We prove that dynamical stability in the sense of <a href="/abs/1403.7603">arXiv:1403.7603</a> preserves hyperbolicity within such families, and give a complete classification of the hyperbolic components that are the analogue, in this setting, of the complement of the Mandelbrot set for the family $z^2 +c$. We also precisely describe the geometry of the bifurcation locus and current near the boundary of the parameter space. One of our tools is an asymptotic equidistribution property for the bifurcation current. This is established in the general setting of families of endomorphisms of $\mathbb{P}^k$ and is the first equidistribution result of this kind for holomorphic dynamical systems in dimension larger than one.;math.DS
1801.01461;A New HDG Method for Dirichlet Boundary Control of Convection Diffusion PDEs I: High Regularity;We propose a new hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method to approximate the solution of a Dirichlet boundary control problem governed by an elliptic convection diffusion PDE. Even without a convection term, Dirichlet boundary control problems are well-known to be very challenging theoretically and numerically. Although there are many works in the literature on Dirichlet boundary control problems for the Poisson equation, the authors are not aware of any existing theoretical or numerical analysis works for convection diffusion Dirichlet control problems. We make two contributions. First, we obtain well-posedness and regularity results for the Dirichlet control problem. Second, under certain assumptions on the domain and the target state, we obtain optimal a priori error estimates in 2D for the control for the new HDG method. As far as the authors are aware, there are no existing comparable results in the literature. We present numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the HDG method.;math.NA
1801.01463;L&#x27,espace ad&#xe9,lique d&#x27,un tore sur un corps de fonctions;Let $k$ be a field of characteristic 0 and let $K$ be the function field of a smooth projective geometrically integral $k$-curve $X$. Let $T$ be a $K$-torus. In this article, we aim at studying the space of adelic points $T(S,\mathbb{A}_K)$ of $T$ outside a finite set $S$ of closed points of $X$. We start by proving that the group $T(K)$ of rational points of $T$ is always discrete (hence closed) in $T(S,\mathbb{A}_K)$. We then describe the quotient $T(\emptyset,\mathbb{A}_K)/T(K)$ in each of the following three cases: $k$ is an algebraically closed field, $k$ is the field of Laurent series $\mathbb{C}((t))$, and $k$ is a $p$-adic field. <br />Soient $k$ un corps de caract\'eristique 0 et $K$ le corps des fonctions d'une $k$-courbe projective lisse g\'eom\'etriquement int\`egre $X$. Soit $T$ un $K$-tore. Dans cet article, on cherche \`a \'etudier l'espace des points ad\'eliques $T(S,\mathbb{A}_K)$ de $T$ hors d'un ensemble fini $S$ de points ferm\'es de $X$. On commence par montrer que le groupe $T(K)$ des points rationnels de $T$ est toujours ferm\'e discret dans $T(S,\mathbb{A}_K)$. On d\'ecrit ensuite le quotient $T(\emptyset,\mathbb{A}_K)/T(K)$ dans chacun des trois cas suivants: $k$ corps alg\'ebriquement clos, $k=\mathbb{C}((t))$ et $k$ corps $p$-adique.;math.AG
1801.01482;Finite semilattices with many congruences;For an integer $n\geq 2$, let NCSL$(n)$ denote the set of sizes of congruence lattices of $n$-element semilattices. We find the four largest numbers belonging to NCSL$(n)$, provided that $n$ is large enough to ensure that $|$NCSL$(n)|\geq 4$. Furthermore, we describe the $n$-element semilattices witnessing these numbers.;math.RA
1801.01485;Variational analysis and variational rationality in behavioral sciences: stationary traps;This paper concerns applications of variational analysis to some local aspects of behavioral science modeling by developing an effective variational rationality approach to these and related issues. Our main attention is paid to local stationary traps, which reflect such local equilibrium and the like positions in behavioral science models that are not worthwhile to quit. We establish constructive linear optimistic evaluations of local stationary traps by using generalized differential tools of variational analysis that involve subgradients and normals for nonsmooth and nonconvex objects as well as variational and extremal principles.;math.OC
1801.01491;The Action of Young Subgroups on the Partition Complex;We study the restrictions, the strict fixed points, and the strict quotients of the partition complex $|\Pi_n|$, which is the $\Sigma_n$-space attached to the poset of proper nontrivial partitions of the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. <br />We express the space of fixed points $|\Pi_n|^G$ in terms of subgroup posets for general $G\subset \Sigma_n$ and prove a formula for the restriction of $|\Pi_n|$ to Young subgroups $\Sigma_{n_1}\times \dots\times \Sigma_{n_k}$. Both results follow by applying a general method, proven with discrete Morse theory, for producing equivariant branching rules on lattices with group actions. We uncover surprising links between strict Young quotients of $|\Pi_n|$, commutative monoid spaces, and the cotangent fibre in derived algebraic geometry. These connections allow us to construct a cofibre sequence relating various strict quotients $|\Pi_n|^\diamond\wedge_{\Sigma_n} (S^\ell)^{\wedge n}$ and give a combinatorial proof of a splitting in derived algebraic geometry. Combining all our results, we decompose strict Young quotients of $|\Pi_n|$ in terms of "atoms" $|\Pi_d|^\diamond\wedge_{\Sigma_d} (S^\ell)^{\wedge d}$ for $\ell$ odd and compute their homology. We thereby also generalise Goerss' computation of the algebraic Andr\'e-Quillen homology of trivial square-zero extensions from $\mathbb{F}_2$ to $\mathbb{F}_p$ for $p$ an odd prime.;math.AT
1801.01512;Hats: all or nothing;N players are randomly fitted with a colored hat (q different colors). All players guess simultaneously the color of their own hat observing only the hat colors of the other N-1 players. The team wins if all players guess right. No communication of any sort is allowed, except for an initial strategy session before the game begins. In the first part of our investigation we have q different colors with equal probability. Up to 4 colors we construct optimal strategies for any number of players using Hamming Complete Sets. For 5 colors we find optimal strategies up to 5 players using Optimal Hamming Sets. In the second part we have two colors where the probabilities may differ. We construct optimal strategies and maximal probability of winning the game for any number of players.;math.CO
1801.01526;An algebraic perspective on integer sparse recovery;Compressed sensing is a relatively new mathematical paradigm that shows a small number of linear measurements are enough to efficiently reconstruct a large dimensional signal under the assumption the signal is sparse. Applications for this technology are ubiquitous, ranging from wireless communications to medical imaging, and there is now a solid foundation of mathematical theory and algorithms to robustly and efficiently reconstruct such signals. However, in many of these applications, the signals of interest do not only have a sparse representation, but have other structure such as lattice-valued coefficients. While there has been a small amount of work in this setting, it is still not very well understood how such extra information can be utilized during sampling and reconstruction. Here, we explore the problem of integer sparse reconstruction, lending insight into when this knowledge can be useful, and what types of sampling designs lead to robust reconstruction guarantees. We use a combination of combinatorial, probabilistic and number-theoretic methods to discuss existence and some constructions of such sensing matrices with concrete examples. We also prove sparse versions of Minkowski's Convex Body and Linear Forms theorems that exhibit some limitations of this framework.;math.NA
1801.01530;The Mutating Contact Process: Model Introduction and Qualitative Analysis of Phase Transitions in its Survival;We introduce and study the mutating contact process, a variant of the multitype contact process, where one type mutates at a constant rate to the other type. We prove that on $\mathbb{Z}$ a single mutant cannot survive while on $\mathbb{T}_{d}$ there are distinct weak survival and extinction of a single mutant phases, yet the limiting distribution concentrates on configurations with no mutants of the first type for any values of the parameters.;math.PR
1801.01537;Tauberian class estimates for vector-valued distributions;We study Tauberian properties of regularizing transforms of vector-valued tempered distributions, that is, transforms of the form $M^{\mathbf{f}}_{\varphi}(x,y)=(\mathbf{f}\ast\varphi_{y})(x)$, where the kernel $\varphi$ is a test function and $\varphi_{y}(\cdot)=y^{-n}\varphi(\cdot/y)$. We investigate conditions which ensure that a distribution that a priori takes values in locally convex space actually takes values in a narrower Banach space. Our goal is to characterize spaces of Banach space valued tempered distributions in terms of so-called class estimates for the transform $M^{\mathbf{f}}_{\varphi}(x,y)$. Our results generalize and improve earlier Tauberian theorems of Drozhzhinov and Zav'yalov [Sb. Math. 194 (2003), 1599-1646]. Special attention is paid to find the optimal class of kernels $\varphi$ for which these Tauberian results hold.;math.FA
1801.01540;Jacob&#x27,s Ladder: Prime numbers in 2d;Prime numbers are one of the most intriguing figures in mathematics. Despite centuries of research, many questions remain still unsolved. In recent years, computer simulations are playing a fundamental role in the study of an immense variety of problems. In this work, we present a simple representation of prime numbers in two dimensions that allows us to formulate a number of conjectures that may lead to important avenues in the field of research on prime numbers. In particular, although the zeroes in our representation grow in a somewhat erratic, hardly predictable way, the gaps between them present a remarkable and intriguing property: a clear exponential decay in the frequency of gaps vs gap size. The smaller the gaps, the more frequently they appear. Additionally, the sequence of zeroes, despite being non-consecutive numbers, contains a number of primes approximately equal to n/log(n) , being n the number of terms in the sequence.;math.HO
1801.01542;Congruences of Power Sums;The following congruence for power sums, $S_n(p)$, is well known and has many applications: $1^n+2^n +\dots +p^n \equiv\begin{cases} -1 \text{ mod } p, &amp, \text{ if } \ p-1 \ | \ n, 0 \text{ mod } p, &amp, \text{ if } \ p-1 \ \not| \ n, \end{cases}$ where $n\in{\mathbb N}$ and $p$ is prime. We extend this congruence, in particular, to the case when $p$ is any power of a prime. We also show that the sequence $(S_n(m) \text{ mod } k )_{m \geq 1}$ is periodic and determine its period.;math.NT
1801.01544;Boundary value problem with measures for fractional elliptic equations involving source nonlinearities;We are concerned with positive solutions of equation (E) $(-\Delta)^s u=f(u)$ in a domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ ($N&gt,2s$), where $s \in (\frac{1}{2},1)$ and $f\in C^{\alpha}_{loc}(\mathbb{R})$ for some $\alpha \in(0,1)$. We establish a universal a priori estimate for positive solutions of (E), as well as for their gradients. Then for $C^2$ bounded domain $\Omega$, we prove the existence of positive solutions of (E) with prescribed boundary value $\rho \nu$, where $\rho&gt,0$ and $\nu$ is a positive Radon measure on $\partial \Omega$ with total mass $1$, and discuss regularity property of the solutions. When $f(u)=u^p$, we demonstrate that there exists a critical exponent $p_s:=\frac{N+s}{N-s}$ in the following sense. If $p\geq p_s$, the problem does not admit any positive solution with $\nu$ being a Dirac mass. If $p\in(1,p_s)$ there exits a threshold value $\rho^*&gt,0$ such that for $\rho\in (0, \rho^*]$, the problem admits a positive solution and for $\rho&gt,\rho^*$, no positive solution exists. We also show that, for $\rho&gt,0$ small enough, the problem admits at least two positive solutions.;math.AP
1801.01546;Characterization of distributions of $Q$-independent random variables on locally compact Abelian groups;Let $X$ be a second countable locally compact Abelian group. We prove some group analogues of the Skitovich--Darmois, Heyde and Kac--Bernstein characterisation theorems for $Q$-independent random variables taking values in the group $X$. The proofs of these theorems are reduced to solving some functional equations on the character group of the group $X$.;math.PR
1801.01552;Asymptotic bounds for spherical codes;The set of all error-correcting codes C over a fixed finite alphabet F of cardinality q determines the set of code points in the unit square with coordinates (R(C), delta (C)):= (relative transmission rate, relative minimal distance). The central problem of the theory of such codes consists in maximizing simultaneously the transmission rate of the code and the relative minimum Hamming distance between two different code words. The classical approach to this problem explored in vast literature consists in the inventing explicit constructions of "good codes" and comparing new classes of codes with earlier ones. Less classical approach studies the geometry of the whole set of code points (R,delta) (with q fixed), at first independently of its computability properties, and only afterwords turning to the problems of computability, analogies with statistical physics etc. The main purpose of this article consists in extending this latter strategy to domain of spherical codes.;cs.IT
1801.01555;Reeb Posets and Tree Approximations;A well known result in the analysis of finite metric spaces due to Gromov says that given any $(X,d_X)$ there exists a \emph{tree metric} $t_X$ on $X$ such that $\|d_X-t_X\|_\infty$ is bounded above by twice $\mathrm{hyp}(X)\cdot \log(2\,|X|)$. Here $\mathrm{hyp}(X)$ is the \emph{hyperbolicity} of $X$, a quantity that measures the \emph{treeness} of $4$-tuples of points in $X$. This bound is known to be asymptotically tight. <br />We improve this bound by restricting ourselves to metric spaces arising from filtered posets. By doing so we are able to replace the cardinality appearing in Gromov's bound by a certain poset theoretic invariant (the maximum length of fences in the poset) which can be much smaller thus significantly improving the approximation bound. <br />The setting of metric spaces arising from posets is rich: For example, save for the possible addition of new vertices, every finite metric graph can be induced from a filtered poset. Since every finite metric space can be isometrically embedded into a finite metric graph, our ideas are applicable to finite metric spaces as well. <br />At the core of our results lies the adaptation of the Reeb graph and Reeb tree constructions and the concept of hyperbolicity to the setting of posets, which we use to formulate and prove a tree approximation result for any filtered poset.;math.MG
1801.01556;A bound on the inducibility of cycles;In 1975, Pippenger and Golumbic conjectured that every n-vertex graph has at most $n^k/(k^k - k)$ induced cycles of length k for k at least 5. We prove that every n-vertex graph has at most $2 n^k/k^k$ induced cycles of length k.;math.CO
1801.01561;Multiplicity freeness of unitary representations in sections of holomorphic Hilbert bundles;We prove several results asserting that the action of a Banach-Lie group on Hilbert spaces of holomorphic sections of a holomorphic Hilbert space bundle over a complex Banach manifold is multiplicity free. These results require the existence of compatible antiholomorphic bundle maps and certain multiplicity freeness assumptions for stabilizer groups. For the group action on the base, the notion of an $(S,\sigma)$-weakly visible action (generalizing T.Koboyashi's visible actions) provides an effective way to express the assumptions in an economical fashion. In particular, we derive a version for group actions on homogeneous bundles for larger groups. We illustrate these general results by several examples related to operator groups and von Neumann algebras.;math.RT
1801.01562;The Distortion of the Reeb Quotient Map on Riemannian Manifolds;Given a metric space $X$ and a function $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$, the Reeb construction gives metric a space $X_f$ together with a quotient map $X \to X_f$. Under suitable conditions $X_f$ becomes a metric graph and can therefore be used as a graph approximation to $X$. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance from $X_f$ to $X$ is bounded by the half of the metric distortion of the quotient map. In this paper we consider the case where $X$ is a compact Riemannian manifold and $f$ is an excellent Morse function. In this case we provide bounds on the distortion of the quotient map which involve the first Betti number of the original space and a novel invariant which we call thickness.;math.MG
1801.01564;Expansion of Iterated Stratonovich Stochastic Integrals of Multiplicity 3, Based on Generalized Multiple Fourier Series, Converging in the Mean: General Case of Series Summation;The article is devoted to the development of the method of expansion and mean-square approximation of iterated Ito stochastic integrals, based on generalized multiple Fourier series, converging in the mean. We adapt this method for iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of multiplicity 3 from the Taylor-Stratonovich expansion. The main result of the article has been derived with using the triple Fourier-Legendre series as well as the triple trigonometric Fourier series for the general case of series summation. The results of the article can be applied to numerical integration of Ito stochastic differential equations in accordance with the strong criterion of convergence.;math.PR
1801.01566;Adaptive Finite Element Solution of the Porous Medium Equation in Pressure Formulation;A lack of regularity in the solution of the porous medium equation poses a serious challenge in its theoretical and numerical studies. A common strategy in theoretical studies is to utilize the pressure formulation of the equation where a new variable called the mathematical pressure is introduced. It is known that the new variable has much better regularity than the original one and Darcy's law for the movement of the free boundary can be expressed naturally in this new variable. The pressure formulation has not been used in numerical studies. The goal of this work is to study its use in the adaptive finite element solution of the porous medium equation. The MMPDE moving mesh strategy is employed for adaptive mesh movement while linear finite elements are used for spatial discretization. The free boundary is traced explicitly by integrating Darcy's law with the Euler scheme. Numerical results are presented for three two-dimensional examples. The method is shown to be second-order in space and first-order in time in the pressure variable. Moreover, the convergence order of the error in the location of the free boundary is almost second-order in the maximum norm. However, numerical results also show that the convergence order of the method in the original variable stays between first-order and second-order in the $L^1$ norm or between 0.5th-order and first-order in the $L^2$ norm. Nevertheless, the current method can offer some advantages over numerical methods based on the original formulation for situations with large exponents or when a more accurate location of the free boundary is desired.;math.NA
1801.01570;How Many Rounds Should You Expect in Urn Solitaire?;A certain sampling process, concerning an urn with balls of two colors, proposed in 1965 by B.E. Oakley and R.L. Perry, and discussed by Peter Winkler and Martin Gardner, that has an extremely simple answer for the probability, namely the constant function 1/2, has a far more complicated expected duration, that we discover and sketch the proof of. So unlike, for example, the classical gambler's ruin problem, for which both `probability of winning' and `expected duration' have very simple expressions, in this case the expected number of rounds is extremely complicated, and beyond the scope of humans.;math.CO
1801.01574;Testing Optimality of Sequential Decision-Making;This paper provides a statistical method to test whether a system that performs a binary sequential hypothesis test is optimal in the sense of minimizing the average decision times while taking decisions with given reliabilities. The proposed method requires samples of the decision times, the decision outcomes, and the true hypotheses, but does not require knowledge on the statistics of the observations or the properties of the decision-making system. The method is based on fluctuation relations for decision time distributions which are proved for sequential probability ratio tests. These relations follow from the martingale property of probability ratios and hold under fairly general conditions. We illustrate these tests with numerical experiments and discuss potential applications.;cs.IT
1801.01575;Punctured spheres in complex hyperbolic surfaces and bielliptic ball quotient compactifications;In this paper, we study punctured spheres in two dimensional ball quotient compactifications $(X, D)$. For example, we show that smooth toroidal compactifications of ball quotients cannot contain properly holomorphically embedded $3$-punctured spheres. We also use totally geodesic punctured spheres to prove ampleness of $K_X + \alpha D$ for $\alpha \in (\frac{1}{4}, 1)$, giving a sharp version of a theorem of the first author with G. Di Cerbo. Finally, we produce the first examples of bielliptic ball quotient compactifications modeled on the Gaussian integers.;math.GT
1801.01578;A Robust Preconditioner for High-Contrast Problems;A finite-element discretization of such an equation yields a linear system whose conditioning worsens as the variations in the values of PDE coefficients becomes large. This paper introduces a procedure by which the discrete system obtained from a linear finite element discretization of the given continuum problem is converted into an equivalent linear system of the saddle point type. Then a robust preconditioner for the Lanczos method of minimized iterations for solving the derived saddle point problem is proposed. Robustness with respect to the contrast parameter and the mesh size is justified. Numerical examples support theoretical results and demonstrate independence of the number of iterations on the contrast, the mesh size and also on the different contrasts on the inclusions.;math.NA
1801.01581;Frobenius-Perron Theory of Modified ADE Bound Quiver Algebras;The Frobenius-Perron dimension for an abelian category was recently introduced. We apply this theory to the category of representations of the finite-dimensional radical squared zero algebras associated to certain modified ADE graphs. In particular, we take an ADE quiver with arrows in a certain orientation and an arbitrary number of loops at each vertex. We show that the Frobenius-Perron dimension of this category is equal to the maximum number of loops at a vertex. Along the way, we introduce a result which can be applied in general to calculate the Frobenius-Perron dimension of a radical square zero bound quiver algebra. We use this result to introduce a family of abelian categories which produce arbitrarily large irrational Frobenius-Perron dimensions.;math.RA
1801.01584;Fixation probabilities and hitting times under low levels of frequency-dependent selection;In population genetics, diffusions on the unit interval are often used to model the frequency path of an allele. In this setting we derive approximations for fixation probabilities, expected hitting times and the expected site-frequency-spectrum under small frequency-dependent selection. Specifically, we rederive and extend the one-third rule of evolutionary game theory (Nowak et al., 2004) and effects of stochastic slowdown (Altrock and Traulsen, 2009). Since similar effects are of interest in other application areas, we formulate our results for general one-dimensional diffusions.;math.PR
1801.01588;On a class of polynomials connected to Bell polynomials;In this paper, we study a class of sequences of polynomials linked to the sequence of Bell polynomials. Some sequences of this class have applications on the theory of hyperbolic differential equations and other sequences generalize Laguerre polynomials and associated Lah polynomials. We discuss, for these polynomials, their explicit expressions, relations to the successive derivatives of a given function, real zeros and recurrence relations. Some known results are significantly simplified.;math.CO
1801.01593;Estimation in the spiked Wigner model: A short proof of the replica formula;We consider the problem of estimating a rank-one perturbation of a Wigner matrix in a setting of low signal-to-noise ratio. This serves as a simple model for principal component analysis in high dimensions. The mutual information per variable between the spike and the observed matrix, or equivalently, the normalized Kullback-Leibler divergence between the planted and null models are known to converge to the so-called {\em replica-symmetric} formula, the properties of which determine the fundamental limits of estimation in this model. We provide in this note a short and transparent proof of this formula, based on simple executions of Gaussian interpolations and standard concentration-of-measure arguments. The \emph{Franz-Parisi potential}, that is, the free entropy at a fixed overlap, plays an important role in our proof. Furthermore, our proof can be generalized straightforwardly to spiked tensor models of even order.;cs.IT
1801.01605;Distance between arithmetic progressions and perfect squares;In this paper, we study how close the terms of a finite arithmetic progression can get to a perfect square.

1801.01608;The Definition and Numerical Method of Final Value Problem and Arbitrary Value Problem;Many Engineering Problems could be mathematically described by Final Value Problem, which is the inverse problem of Initial Value Problem. Accordingly, the paper studies the final value problem in the field of ODE problems and analyses the differences and relations between initial and final value problems. The more general new concept of the endpoints-value problem which could describe both initial and final problems is proposed. Further, we extend the concept into inner-interval value problem and arbitrary value problem and point out that both endpoints-value problem and inner-interval value problem are special forms of arbitrary value problem. Particularly, the existence and uniqueness of the solutions of final value problem and inner-interval value problem of first order ordinary differential equation are proved for discrete problems. The numerical calculation formulas of the problems are derived, and for each algorithm, we propose the convergence and stability conditions of them. Furthermore, multivariate and high-order final value problems are further studied, and the condition of fixed delay is also discussed in this paper. At last, the effectiveness of the considered methods is validated by numerical experiment.;math.NA
1801.01610;On Convergence to Essential Singularities;An iterative optimization method applied to a function $f$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ will produce a sequence of arguments $\{\mathbf{x}_k\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, this sequence is often constrained such that $\{f(\mathbf{x}_k)\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ is monotonic. As part of the analysis of an iterative method, one may ask under what conditions the sequence $\{\mathbf{x}_k\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges. In 2005, Absil et al.\ employed the {\L}ojasiewicz gradient inequality in a proof of convergence, this requires that the objective function exist at a cluster point of the sequence. Here we provide a convergence result that does not require $f$ to be defined at the limit $\lim_{k \to \infty} \mathbf{x}_k$, should the limit exist. We show that a variant of the {\L}ojasiewicz gradient inequality holds on sets adjacent to singularities of bounded multivariate rational functions. We extend the results of Absil et al.\ to prove that if $\{\mathbf{x}_k\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ has a cluster point $\mathbf{x}_*$, if $f$ is a bounded multivariate rational function on $\mathbb{R}^n$, and if a technical condition holds, then $\mathbf{x}_k \to \mathbf{x}_*$ even if $\mathbf{x}_*$ is not in the domain of $f$. We demonstrate how this may be employed to analyze divergent sequences by mapping them to projective space, and consider the implications this has for the study of low-rank tensor approximations.;math.NA
1801.01613;High Throughput Low Delay Wireless Multicast via Multi-Channel Moving Window Codes;A fundamental challenge in wireless multicast has been how to simultaneously achieve high-throughput and low-delay for reliably serving a large number of users. In this paper, we show how to harness substantial throughput and delay gains by exploiting multi-channel resources. We develop a new scheme called Multi-Channel Moving Window Codes (MC-MWC) for multi-channel multi-session wireless multicast. The salient features of MC-MWC are three-fold. (i) High throughput: we show that MC-MWC achieves order-optimal throughput in the many-user many-channel asymptotic regime. Moreover, the number of channels required by a conventional channel-allocation based scheme is shown to be doubly-exponentially larger than that required by MC-MWC. (ii) Low delay: using large deviations theory, we show that the delay of MC-MWC decreases linearly with the number of channels, while the delay reduction of conventional schemes is no more than a finite constant. (iii) Low feedback overhead: the feedback overhead of MC-MWC is a constant that is independent of both the number of receivers in each session and the number of sessions in the network. Finally, our trace-driven simulation and numerical results validate the analytical results and show that the implementation complexity of MC-MWC is low.;cs.IT
1801.01619;Anticyclotomic $p$-adic $L$-functions for elliptic curves at some additive reduction primes;Let $E$ be a rational elliptic curve and let $p$ be an odd prime of additive reduction. Let $K$ be an imaginary quadratic field and fix a positive integer $c$ prime to the conductor of $E$. The main goal of the present article is to define an anticyclotomic $p$-adic $L$-function $\L$ attached to $E/K$ when $E/\QQ_p$ attains semistable reduction over an abelian extension. We prove that $\L$ satisfies the expected interpolation properties, namely, we show that if $\chi$ is an anticyclotomic character of conductor $cp^n$ then $\chi(\L)$ is equal (up to explicit constants) to $L(E,\chi,1)$ or $L'(E,\chi,1)$.;math.NT
1801.01625;Optimal Pilot Symbols Ratio in terms of Spectrum and Energy Efficiency in Uplink CoMP Networks;In wireless networks, Spectrum Efficiency (SE) and Energy Efficiency (EE) can be affected by the channel estimation that needs to be well designed in practice. In this paper, considering channel estimation error and non-ideal backhaul links, we optimize the pilot symbols ratio in terms of SE and EE in uplink Coordinated Multi-point (CoMP) networks. Modeling the channel estimation error, we formulate the SE and EE maximization problems by analyzing the system capacity with imperfect channel estimation. The maximal system capacity in SE optimization and the minimal transmit power in EE optimization, which both have the closed-form expressions, are derived by some reasonable approximations to reduce the complexity of solving complicated equations. Simulations are carried out to validate the superiority of our scheme, verify the accuracy of our approximation, and show the effect of pilot symbols ratio.;cs.IT
1801.01626;Weighted estimates and Fujita exponent for a nonlocal equation;We investigate a nonlocal equation $\partial_tu=\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}J(x-y)(u(y,t)-u(x,t))dy+a(x,t)u^p$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $a$ is unbounded and $J$ belongs to a weighted space. Crucial weighted $L^p$ and interpolation estimates for the Green operator are established by a new method based on the sharp Young's inequality, the asymptotic behavior of a regular varying coefficients exponential series, and the properties of auxiliary functions $\varGamma=(1+|x|^2/\eta)^{b/2}$ that $-\varGamma/\eta\lesssim J\ast\varGamma-\varGamma\lesssim\varGamma/\eta$ and $\eta^{-b_+/2}\lesssim\varGamma/\left\langle x\right\rangle^b\lesssim \eta^{-b_-/2}$. Blow-up behaviors are investigated by employing test functions $\phi_R=\varGamma$ ($\eta=R$) instead of principal eigenfunctions. Global well-posedness in weighted $L^p$ spaces for the Cauchy problem is proved. When $a\sim\left\langle x\right\rangle^\sigma$ the Fujita exponent is shown to be $1+(\sigma+2)/n$. Our approach generalizes and unifies nonlocal diffusion equations and pseudoparabolic equations.;math.AP

In order to study homogeneous system of linear differential equations, I considered vector space over division $D$-algebra, solving of linear equations over division $D$-algebra and the theory of eigenvalues in non commutative division $D$-algebra.

1801.01629;Euler evolution of a concentrated vortex in planar bounded domains;In this paper, we consider the time evolution of an ideal fluid in a planar bounded domain. We prove that if the initial vorticity is supported in a sufficiently small region with diameter $\varepsilon$, then the time evolved vorticity is also supported in a small region with diameter $d$, $d\leq C\varepsilon^{\alpha}$ for any $\alpha&lt,\frac{1}{3}$, and the center of the vorticity tends to the point vortex, the motion of which is described by the Kirchhoff-Routh equation.;math.AP
1801.01642;Parity Considerations in Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon Type Overpartitions;In 2010, Andrews considers a variety of parity questions connected to classical partition identities of Euler, Rogers, Ramanujan and Gordon. As a large part in his paper, Andrews considered the partitions by restricting the parity of occurrences of even numbers or odd numbers in the Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon type. The Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon type partition was defined by Gordon in 1961 as a combinatorial generalization of the Rogers-Ramaujan identities with odd moduli. <br />In 1974, Andrews derived an identity which can be considered as the generating function counterpart of the Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon theorem, and since then it has been called the Andrews--Gordon identity. By revisting the Andrews--Gordon identity Andrews extended his results by considering some additional restrictions involving parities to obtain some Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon type theorems and Andrews--Gordon type identities. In the end of Andrews' paper, he posed $15$ open problems. Most of Andrews' $15$ open problems have been settled, but the $11$th that "extend the parity indices to overpartitions in a manner" has not. In 2013, Chen, Sang and Shi, derived the overpartition analogues of the Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon theorem and the Andrews-Gordon identity. In this paper, we post some parity restrictions on these overpartitions analogues to get some Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon type overpartition theorems.;math.CO
1801.01648;Energy-Efficient User Access Control and Resource Allocation in HCNs with Non-Ideal Circuitry;In this paper, we study the energy-efficient user access control (UAC) based on resource allocation (RA) in heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs) with the required downlink data rate under non-ideal power amplifiers (PAs) and circuit power. It is proved that the energy consumption minimization is achieved when the typical user accesses only one base station (BS), while the other BSs remain in idle mode on the transmission resource allocated to this user. For this purpose, we reformulate the original non-convex optimization problem into a series of convex optimization problems where, in each case, the transmit power and duration of the accessed BS are determined. Then, the BS with the minimal energy consumption is selected for transmission. Considering the approximate situation, it is showed that the optimal transmit duration of the accessed BS can be estimated in closed form. The benefits of our proposed UAC and RA schemes are validated using numerical simulations, which also characterize the effect that non-ideal PAs have on the total energy consumption of different transmission schemes.;cs.IT
1801.01652;Energy Efficiency Maximization for CoMP Joint Transmission with Non-Ideal Power Amplifiers;Coordinated multipoint (CoMP) joint transmission (JT) can save a great deal of energy especially for cell-edge users due to strengthened received signal, but at the cost of deploying and coordinating cooperative nodes, which degrades energy efficiency (EE), particularly when considerable amount of energy is consumed by nonideal hardware circuit. In this paper, we study energyefficient cooperation establishment, including cooperative nodes selection (CNS) and power allocation, to satisfy a required data rate in coherent JT-CoMP networks with non-ideal power amplifiers (PAs) and circuit power. The selection priority lemma is proved first, and then the formulated discrete combinatorial EE optimization is resolved by proposing node selection criterion and deriving closedform expressions of optimal transmission power. Therefore, an efficient algorithm is provided and its superiority is validated by Monte Carlo simulations, which also show the effects of non-ideal PA and the data rate demand on EE and optimal number of active nodes.;cs.IT

1801.01663;Energy Efficiency Analysis of Heterogeneous Cellular Networks With Extra Cell Range Expansion;The split control and user plane is key to the future heterogeneous cellular network (HCN), where the small cells are dedicated for the most data transmission while the macrocells are mainly responsible for the control signaling. Adapting to this technology, we propose a general and tractable framework of extra cell range expansion (CRE) by introducing an additional bias factor to enlarge the range of small cells flexibly for the extra offloaded macrousers in a two-tier HCN, where the macrocell and small cell users have different required data rates. Using stochastic geometry, we analyze the energy efficiency (EE) of the extra CRE with joint low power transmission and resource partitioning, where the coverages of EE and data rate are formulated theoretically. Numerical simulations verify that the proposed extra CRE can improve the EE performance of HCN, and also show that deploying more small cells can provide benefits for EE coverage, but the EE improvement becomes saturated if the small cell density exceeds a threshold. Instead of establishing the detail configuration, this paper can provide some valuable insights and guidelines to the practical design of future networks, especially for the traffic offloading in HCN.;cs.IT
1801.01673;On the average condition number of tensor rank decompositions;We compute the expected value of powers of the geometric condition number of random tensor rank decompositions. It is shown in particular that the expected value of the condition number of $n_1\times n_2 \times 2$ tensors with a random rank-$r$ decomposition, given by factor matrices with independent and identically distributed standard normal entries, is infinite. This entails that it is expected and probable that such a rank-$r$ decomposition is sensitive to perturbations of the tensor. Moreover, it provides concrete further evidence that tensor decomposition can be a challenging problem, also from the numerical point of view. On the other hand, we provide strong theoretical and empirical evidence that tensors of size $n_1~\times~n_2~\times~n_3$ with all $n_1,n_2,n_3 \ge 3$ have a finite average condition number. This suggests there exists a gap in the expected sensitivity of tensors between those of format $n_1\times n_2 \times 2$ and other order-3 tensors. For establishing these results, we show that a natural weighted distance from a tensor rank decomposition to the locus of ill-posed decompositions with an infinite geometric condition number is bounded from below by the inverse of this condition number. That is, we prove one inequality towards a so-called condition number theorem for the tensor rank decomposition.;math.NA

Our work involves three parts. In the first part, we construct Eisenstein series adelically and compute their constant terms by computing local integrals. In the second part, we prove a control theorem for one-variable ordinary $\Lambda$-adic Hilbert modular forms following Hida's work on the space of multivariable ordinary $\Lambda$-adic Hilbert cusp forms. In part three, we compute congruence modules related to Hilbert Eisenstein series through an analog of Ohta's methods.;math.NT

1801.01696;Empirical Bayes analysis of spike and slab posterior distributions;In the sparse normal means model, convergence of the Bayesian posterior distribution associated to spike and slab prior distributions is considered. The key sparsity hyperparameter is calibrated via marginal maximum likelihood empirical Bayes. The plug-in posterior squared-$L^2$ norm is shown to converge at the minimax rate for the euclidean norm for appropriate choices of spike and slab distributions. Possible choices include standard spike and slab with heavy tailed slab, and the spike and slab LASSO of Rockov\'a and George with heavy tailed slab. Surprisingly, the popular Laplace slab is shown to lead to a suboptimal rate for the full empirical Bayes posterior. This provides a striking example where convergence of aspects of the empirical Bayes posterior does not entail convergence of the full empirical Bayes posterior itself.;math.ST
1801.01699;Variable-Length Intrinsic Randomness Allowing Positive Value of the Average Variational Distance;This paper considers the problem of variable-length intrinsic randomness. We propose the average variational distance as the performance criterion from the viewpoint of a dual relationship with the problem formulation of variable-length resolvability. Previous study has derived the general formula of the $\epsilon$-variable-length resolvability. We derive the general formula of the $\epsilon$-variable-length intrinsic randomness. Namely, we characterize the supremum of the mean length under the constraint that the value of the average variational distance is smaller than or equal to a constant $\epsilon$. Our result clarifies a dual relationship between the general formula of $\epsilon$-variable-length resolvability and that of $\epsilon$-variable-length intrinsic randomness. We also derive a lower bound of the quantity characterizing our general formula.;cs.IT
1801.01709;Energy Efficiency Maximization of Full-Duplex Two-Way Relay With Non-Ideal Power Amplifiers and Non-Negligible Circuit Power;In this paper, we maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of full-duplex (FD) two-way relay (TWR) systems under non-ideal power amplifiers (PAs) and non-negligible transmission-dependent circuit power. We start with the case where only the relay operates full duplex and two timeslots are required for TWR. Then, we extend to the advanced case, where the relay and the two nodes all operate full duplex, and accomplish TWR in a single timeslot. In both cases, we establish the intrinsic connections between the optimal transmit powers and durations, based on which the original non-convex EE maximization can be convexified and optimally solved. Simulations show the superiority of FD-TWR in terms of EE, especially when traffic demand is high. The simulations also reveal that the maximum EE of FD-TWR is more sensitive to the PA efficiency, than it is to self-cancellation. The full FD design of FD-TWR is susceptible to traffic imbalance, while the design with only the relay operating in the FD mode exhibits strong tolerance.;cs.IT

The main results consist of global (in time) existence of weak solutions, characterization of parabolic smoothing effects (implying under proper condition eventual boundedness of trajectories), and convergence of each solution to a (single) equilibrium. In particular, to prove the convergence result, a variant of the so-called \L ojasiewicz-Simon inequality is provided for the fractional Dirichlet Laplacian and (possibly) non-analytic (but $C^1$) nonlinearities.;math.AP

1801.01730;Limit cycles of piecewise polynomial perturbations of higher dimensional linear differential systems;The averaging theory has been extensively employed for studying periodic solutions of smooth and nonsmooth differential systems. Here, we extend the averaging theory for studying periodic solutions a class of regularly perturbed non-autonomous $n$-dimensional discontinuous piecewise smooth differential system. As a fundamental hypothesis, it is assumed that the unperturbed system has a manifold $\mathcal{Z}\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ of periodic solutions satisfying $\dim(\mathcal{Z})&lt,n.$ Then, we apply this result to study limit cycles bifurcating from periodic solutions of linear differential systems, $x'=Mx$, when they are perturbed inside a class of discontinuous piecewise polynomial differential systems with two zones. More precisely, we study the periodic solutions of the following differential system $x'=Mx+ \varepsilon F_1^n(x)+\varepsilon^2F_2^n(x),$ in $\mathbb{R}^{d+2}$ where $\varepsilon$ is a small parameter, $M$ is a $(d+2)\times(d+2)$ matrix having one pair of pure imaginary conjugate eigenvalues, $m$ zeros eigenvalues, and $d-m$ non-zero real eigenvalues.;math.DS

When a tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ is graded over a group $\Gamma$, a torus-valued 3-cocycle on $\Gamma$ can be used to deform the associator of $\mathcal{C}$. Based on a natural Fell bundle structure of the tube algebra over the action groupoid of the adjoint action of $\Gamma$, we show that the tube algebra of the twisted category is a 2-cocycle twisting of the original one.;math.QA
1801.01738;Energy-efficient resource allocation for hybrid bursty services in multi-relay OFDM networks;In this paper, we propose Mapped Two-way Water Filling (MTWF) scheme to maximize Energy Efficiency (EE) for hybrid bursty services with Quality of Services (QoS) requirements in Two-Way Multi-Relay (TWMR) OFDM networks. The bursty traffic is first analyzed by strictly proved equivalent homogeneous Poisson process, based on which the QoS requirements are converted into sum-rate constraints. The formulated non-convex EE maximization problem, including subcarrier assignment, Relay Selection (RS) and rate allocation, is NP-hard involving combinatorial optimization. To conduct optimal RS on each subcarrier without priori bursty traffic knowledge, we utilize some approximate relationships under high data rate demands to remove its dependence on two-way data rates, and simplify the whole optimization problem as well. After the optimal channel configuration is obtained, which only depends on channel conditions, subcarrier assignment is attained through Elitist Selection Genetic Algorithm (ESGA), and rate allocation of each service is fulfilled by deducing two-way water filling principle. A new equivalent optimization objective function is proposed next as the simple evaluating index in ESGA to reduce complexity. Finally, simulations are carried out to verify the superiority and convergence of our scheme, as well as the applicability for different scenarios.;cs.IT
1801.01740;Analysis of a micro-macro acceleration method with minimum relative entropy moment matching;We analyse convergence of a micro-macro acceleration method for the Monte Carlo simulation of stochastic differential equations with time-scale separation between the (fast) evolution of individual trajectories and the (slow) evolution of the macroscopic function of interest. We consider a class of methods, presented in [Debrabant, K., Samaey, G., Zieli\'nski, P. A micro-macro acceleration method for the Monte Carlo simulation of stochastic differential equations. SINUM, 55 (2017) no. 6, 2745-2786], that performs short bursts of path simulations, combined with the extrapolation of a few macroscopic state variables forward in time. After extrapolation, a new microscopic state is then constructed, consistent with the extrapolated variable and minimising the perturbation caused by the extrapolation. In the present paper, we study a specific method in which this perturbation is minimised in a relative entropy sense. We discuss why relative entropy is a useful metric, both from a theoretical and practical point of view, and rigorously study local errors and numerical stability of the resulting method as a function of the extrapolation time step and the number of macroscopic state variables. Using these results, we discuss convergence to the full microscopic dynamics, in the limit when the extrapolation time step tends to zero and the number of macroscopic state variables tends to infinity.;math.NA
1801.01744;Volumes and Siegel-Veech constants of $\mathcal{H}(2g-2)$ and Hodge integrals;In the 80's H. Masur and W. Veech defined two numerical invariants of strata of abelian differentials: the volume and the Siegel-Veech constant. Based on numerical experiments, A. Eskin and A. Zorich proposed a series of conjectures for the large genus asymptotics of these invariants. By a careful analysis of the asymptotic behavior of quasi-modular forms, D. Chen, M. Moeller, and D. Zagier proved this conjecture for strata of differentials with simple zeros. Here, we prove that the conjecture holds for the other extreme case, i.e. for strata of differentials with a unique zero. Our main ingredient is the expression of the numerical invariants of these strata in terms of Hodge integrals on moduli spaces of curves.;math.AG
1801.01752;Improving the Secrecy of Distributed Storage Systems using Interference Alignment;Regenerating codes based on the approach of interference alignment for wireless interference channel achieve the cut-set bound for distributed storage systems. These codes provide data reliability, and perform efficient exact node repair when some node fails. Interference alignment as a concept is especially important to improve the repair efficiency of a failed node in a minimum storage regenerating (MSR) code. In addition it can improve the stored data security in presence of passive intruders. In this paper we construct a new code resilient against a threat model where a passive eavesdropper can access the data stored on a subset of nodes and the downloaded data during the repair process of a subset of failed nodes. We achieve an optimal secrecy capacity for the new explicit construction of MSR interference alignment code. Hence, we show that the eavesdropper obtains zero information from the original message stored across the distributed storage, and that we achieve a perfect secrecy.;cs.IT
1801.01754;Pseudo-Anosov maps with small stretch factors on punctured surfaces;Consider the problem of estimating the minimum entropy of pseudo-Anosov maps on a surface of genus $g$ with $n$ punctures. We determine the behaviour of this minimum number for a certain large subset of the $(g,n)$ plane, up to a multiplicative constant. In particular it has been shown that for fixed $n$, this minimum value behaves as $\frac{1}{g}$, proving what Penner speculated in 1991.;math.GT
1801.01761;Numerical Methods for Quasi-Periodic Incident Fields Scattered by Locally Perturbed Periodic Surfaces;Waves scattering from unbounded structures are always complicated problems for numerical simulations. For the case that the non-periodic incident field scattered by (locally perturbed) periodic surfaces, with the help of the Bloch transform, the problem could be solved by some finite element methods, if the incident fields decay at certain rate at the infinity. For faster decaying incident fields, a high order numerical method is also available. However, in these cases, the plain waves, which belong to a very important family of incident fields but do not decay at the infinity, are not included. In this paper, we aim to develop the Bloch transform based standard finite method for this certain case, and then establish the high order method afterwards. Numerical experiments have been carried out for both the standard and high order numerical methods. Based on the algorithms for incident plain waves, we could also extend the numerical methods to more generalized cases when only the not so efficient standard method is available.;math.NA
1801.01766;Right Circulant Matrices with Generalized Fibonacci and\ Lucas Polynomials and Coding Theory;In this paper, we give two new coding algorithms by means of right circulant matrices with elements generalized Fibonacci and Lucas polynomials. For this purpose, we study basic properties of right circulant matrices using generalized Fibonacci polynomials $F_{p,q,n}\left( x\right) $, generalized Lucas polynomials $L_{p,q,n}\left( x\right) $ and geometric sequences.;math.CO
1801.01770;Regularity Results of the Thin Obstacle Problem for the $p(x)$-Laplacian;We study thin obstacle problems involving the energy functional with $p(x)$-growth. We prove higher integrability and H\"{o}lder regularity for the gradient of minimizers of the thin obstacle problems under the assumption that the variable exponent $p(x)$ is H\"{o}lder continuous.;math.AP
1801.01774;Global solvability and boundedness in the $N$-dimensional quasilinear chemotaxis model with logistic source and consumption of chemoattractant;We consider the following chemotaxis model %fully parabolic Keller-Segel system with logistic source $$ \left\{\begin{array}{ll} u_t=\nabla\cdot(D(u)\nabla u)-\chi\nabla\cdot(u\nabla v)+\mu (u-u^2),\quad x\in \Omega, t&gt,0, \disp{v_t-\Delta v=-uv },\quad x\in \Omega, t&gt,0, %\disp{\tau w_t+\delta w=u },\quad %x\in \Omega, t&gt,0, \disp{(\nabla D(u)-\chi u\cdot \nabla v)\cdot \nu=\frac{\partial v}{\partial\nu}=0},\quad x\in \partial\Omega, t&gt,0, \disp{u(x,0)=u_0(x)},\quad v(x,0)=v_0(x),~~ x\in \Omega \end{array}\right. $$ on a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N(N\geq1)$, with smooth boundary $\partial\Omega, \chi$ and $\mu$ are positive constants. Besides appropriate smoothness assumptions, in this paper it is only required that $D(u)\geq C_{D}(u+1)^{m-1}$ for all $u\geq 0$ with some $C_{D} &gt, 0$ and some $$ m&gt,\left\{\begin{array}{ll} 1-\frac{\mu}{\chi[1+\lambda_{0}\|v_0\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}2^{3}]}~~\mbox{if}~~ N\leq2, % &gt,1+\frac{(N+2-2r)^+}{N+2}~~~~~~\mbox{if}~~ % \frac{N+2}{2}\geq r\geq\frac{N+2}{N}, 1~~~~~~\mbox{if}~~ N\geq3, \end{array}\right. $$ then for any sufficiently smooth initial data there exists a classical solution which is global in time and bounded, where $\lambda_{0}$ is a positive constant which is corresponding to the maximal sobolev regularity. The results of this paper extends the results of Jin (J. Diff. Eqns., 263(9)(2017), 5759-5772), who proved the possibility of boundness of weak solutions, in the case $m&gt,1$ and $N=3$.;math.AP

1801.01778;Remarks on the abelian convexity theorem;This note contains some observations on abelian convexity theorems. Convexity along an orbit is established in a very general setting using Kempf-Ness functions. This is applied to give short proofs of the Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg theorem and of abelian convexity for the gradient map in the case of a real analytic submanifold of complex projective space. Finally we give an application to the action on the probability measures.;math.DG
1801.01779;Logarithmic de Rham comparison for open rigid spaces;In this note, we prove the logarithmic $p$-adic comparison theorem for open rigid analytic varieties. We prove that a smooth rigid analytic variety with a strict simple normal crossing divisor is locally $K(\pi,1)$ (in a certain sense) with respect to $\mathbb{F}_p$-local systems and ramified coverings along the divisor. We follow Scholze's method to produce a pro-version of the Faltings site and use this site to prove a primitive comparison theorem in our setting. After introducing period sheaves in our setting, we prove aforesaid comparison theorem.;math.AG
1801.01780;Probabilistic max-plus schemes for solving Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations;We consider fully nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations associated to diffusion control problems involving a finite set-valued (or switching) control and possibly a continuum-valued control. In previous works (Akian, Fodjo, 2016 and 2017), we introduced a lower complexity probabilistic numerical algorithm for such equations by combining max-plus and numerical probabilistic approaches. The max-plus approach is in the spirit of the one of McEneaney, Kaise and Han (2011), and is based on the distributivity of monotone operators with respect to suprema. The numerical probabilistic approach is in the spirit of the one proposed by Fahim, Touzi and Warin (2011). A difficulty of the latter algorithm was in the critical constraints imposed on the Hamiltonian to ensure the monotonicity of the scheme, hence the convergence of the algorithm. Here, we present new probabilistic schemes which are monotone under rather weak assumptions, and show error estimates for these schemes. These estimates will be used in further works to study the probabilistic max-plus method.;math.OC
1801.01784;Vanishing Viscosity Limits of Scalar Equations with Degenerate Diffusivity;We consider a scalar, possibly degenerate parabolic equation with a source term, in several space dimensions. For initial data with bounded variation we prove the existence of solutions to the initial-value problem. Then we show that these solutions converge, in the vanishing-viscosity limit, to the Kruzhkov entropy solution of the corresponding hyperbolic equation. The proof exploits the H-measure compactness in several space dimensions.;math.AP
1801.01790;Multiple addition, deletion and restriction theorems for hyperplane arrangements;In the study of free arrangements, the most useful result to construct/check free arrangements is the addition-deletion theorem. Recently, the multiple version of the addition theorem is proved, called the multiple addition theorem (MAT) to prove the ideal-free theorem. The aim of this article is to give the deletion version of MAT, the multiple deletion theorem (MDT). Also, we can generalize MAT from the viewpoint of our new proof. Moreover, we introduce their restriction version, a multiple restriction theorem (MRT). Applications of them including the combinatorial freeness of the extended Catalan arrangements are given.;math.CO
1801.01795;Sparse highly connected spanning subgraphs in dense directed graphs;Mader proved that every strongly $k$-connected $n$-vertex digraph contains a strongly $k$-connected spanning subgraph with at most $2kn - 2k^2$ edges, where the equality holds for the complete bipartite digraph ${DK}_{k,n-k}$. For dense strongly $k$-connected digraphs, this upper bound can be significantly improved. More precisely, we prove that every strongly $k$-connected $n$-vertex digraph $D$ contains a strongly $k$-connected spanning subgraph with at most $kn + 800k(k+\overline{\Delta}(D))$ edges, where $\overline{\Delta}(D)$ denotes the maximum degree of the complement of the underlying undirected graph of a digraph $D$. Here, the additional term $800k(k+\overline{\Delta}(D))$ is tight up to multiplicative and additive constants. As a corollary, this implies that every strongly $k$-connected $n$-vertex semicomplete digraph contains a strongly $k$-connected spanning subgraph with at most $kn + 800k^2$ edges, which is essentially optimal since $800k^2$ cannot be reduced to the number less than $k(k-1)/2$. <br />We also prove an analogous result for strongly $k$-arc-connected directed multigraphs. Both proofs yield polynomial-time algorithms.;math.CO
1801.01796;Spatially Coupled Sparse Regression Codes: Design and State Evolution Analysis;We consider the design and analysis of spatially coupled sparse regression codes (SC-SPARCs), which were recently introduced by Barbier et al. for efficient communication over the additive white Gaussian noise channel. SC-SPARCs can be efficiently decoded using an Approximate Message Passing (AMP) decoder, whose performance in each iteration can be predicted via a set of equations called state evolution. In this paper, we give an asymptotic characterization of the state evolution equations for SC-SPARCs. For any given base matrix (that defines the coupling structure of the SC-SPARC) and rate, this characterization can be used to predict whether or not AMP decoding will succeed in the large system limit. We then consider a simple base matrix defined by two parameters $(\omega, \Lambda)$, and show that AMP decoding succeeds in the large system limit for all rates $R &lt, \mathcal{C}$. The asymptotic result also indicates how the parameters of the base matrix affect the decoding progression. Simulation results are presented to evaluate the performance of SC-SPARCs defined with the proposed base matrix.;cs.IT
1801.01797;Monte Carlo integration with a growing number of control variates;It is well known that Monte Carlo integration with variance reduction by means of control variates can be implemented by the ordinary least squares estimator for the intercept in a multiple linear regression model. A central limit theorem is established for the integration error if the number of control variates tends to infinity. The integration error is scaled by the standard deviation of the error term in the regression model. If the linear span of the control variates is dense in a function space that contains the integrand, the integration error tends to zero at a rate which is faster than the square root of the number of Monte Carlo replicates. Depending on the situation, increasing the number of control variates may or may not be computationally more efficient than increasing the Monte Carlo sample size.;math.ST
1801.01798;On the existence of an ultra central approximate identity for certain semigroup algebras;In this paper we characterize the existance of an ultra central approximate identity for $\ell^{1}(S)$, where $S$ is a uniformly locally finite inverse semigroup. As an application, for the Brandt semigroup $S=M^{0}(G,I)$ over a non-empty set $I$, we show that $\ell^{1}(S)$ has an ultra central approximate identity if and only if $I$ is finite.;math.FA
1801.01801;On a connectedness principle of Shokurov-Koll&#xe1,r type;Let $(X,\Delta)$ be a log pair over $S$, such that $-(K_X+\Delta)$ is nef over $S$. It is conjectured that the intersection of the non-klt (non Kawamata log terminal) locus of $(X,\Delta)$ with any fiber $X_s$ has at most two connected components. We prove this conjecture in dimension $\leq 4$ and in arbitrary dimension assuming the termination of klt flips.;math.AG
1801.01802;Neighborhood-Prime Labelings of Trees and Other Classes of Graphs;A neighborhood-prime labeling of a graph is a variation of a prime labeling in which the vertices are assigned labels from $1$ to $|V(G)|$ such that the $\gcd$ of the labels in the neighborhood of each non-degree $1$ vertex is equal to $1$. In this paper, we examine neighborhood-prime labelings of several classes of graphs such as polygonal snakes and books, with a focus on trees including caterpillars, spiders, and firecrackers.;math.CO
1801.01806;An elliptic boundary value problem for $G_{2}$ structures;We show that the $G_{2}$ holonomy equation on a manifold with boundary, with prescribed 3-form on the boundary, is elliptic. The main point is to set up a suitable linear elliptic boundary value problem. This result leads to a deformation theory. In particular we establish the existence of certain $G_{2}$ cobordisms between two small deformations of a Calabi-Yau 3-fold.;math.DG
1801.01808;On behavior of homeomorphisms with inverse modulus conditions;We consider some class of homeomorphisms of domains of Euclidean space, which are more general than quasiconformal mappings. For these homeomorphisms, we have obtained theorems on local behavior of it's inverse mappings in a given domain. Under some additional conditions, we proved results about behavior of mappings mentioned above in the closure of the domain.;math.MG
1801.01812;Horospheres in Teichm&#xfc,ller space and mapping class group;We study the geometry of horospheres in Teichm\"uller space of Riemann surfaces of genus g with n punctures, where $3g-3+n\geq 2$. We show that every $C^1$-diffeomorphism of Teichm\"uller space to itself that preserves horospheres is an element of the extended mapping class group. Using the relation between horospheres and metric balls, we obtain a new proof of Royden's Theorem that the isometry group of the Teichm\"uller metric is the extended mapping class group.;math.GT
1801.01813;On a numerical upper bound for the extended Goldbach conjecture;The Goldbach conjecture states that every even number can be decomposed as the sum of two primes. Let $D(N)$ denote the number of such prime decompositions for an even $N$. It is known that $D(N)$ can be bounded above by $$ D(N) \leq C^* \Theta(N), \quad \Theta(N):= \frac{N}{\log^2 N}\prod_{\substack{p|N p&gt,2}} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{p-2}\right)\prod_{p&gt,2}\left(1-\frac{1}{(p-1)^2}\right) $$ where $C^*$ denotes Chen's constant. It is conjectured that $C^*=2$. In 2004, Wu showed that $C^* \leq 7.8209$. We attempted to replicate his work in computing Chen's constant, and in doing so we provide an improved approximation of the Buchstab function $\omega(u)$, \begin{align*} \omega(u)=1/u, &amp, \quad (1\leq u\leq 2), (u \omega(u))'=\omega(u-1), &amp, \quad (u\geq 2). \end{align*} based on work done by Cheer and Goldston. For each interval $[j,j+1]$, they expressed $\omega(u)$ as a Taylor expansion about $u=j+1$. We expanded about the point $u=j+0.5$, so $\omega(u)$ was never evaluated more than $0.5$ away from the center of the Taylor expansion, which gave much stronger error bounds. <br />Issues arose while using this Taylor expansion to compute the required integrals for Chen's constant, so we proceeded with solving the above differential equation to obtain $\omega(u)$, and then integrating the result. Although the values that were obtained undershot Wu's results, we pressed on and refined Wu's work by discretising his integrals with finer granularity. The improvements to Chen's constant were negligible (as predicted by Wu). This provides experimental evidence, but not a proof, that were Wu's integrals computed on smaller intervals in exact form, the improvement to Chen's constant would be negligible. Thus, any substantial improvement on Chen's constant likely requires a radically different method to what Wu provided.;math.HO
1801.01816;Finding the seed of uniform attachment trees;A uniform attachment tree is a random tree that is generated dynamically. Starting from a fixed "seed" tree, vertices are added sequentially by attaching each vertex to an existing vertex chosen uniformly at random. Upon observing a large (unlabeled) tree, one wishes to find the initial seed. We investigate to what extent seed trees can be recovered, at least partially. We consider three types of seeds: a path, a star, and a random uniform attachment tree. We propose and analyze seed-finding algorithms for all three types of seed trees.;math.PR
1801.01819;Twisted arithmetic Siegel Weil formula on X0(N);In this paper, we study twisted arithmetic divisors on the modular curve X_0(N) with N square-free. For each pair (\Delta, r) where \Delta &gt,0 and \Delta \equiv r^2 \mod 4N, we constructed a twisted arithmetic theta function \phi_{\Delta, r}(\tau) which is a generating function of arithmetic twisted Heegner divisors. We prove the modularity of \phi_{\Delta, r}(\tau), along the way, we also identify the arithmetic pairing \langle \phi_{\Delta, r}(\tau),\widehat{\omega}_N \rangle with special value of some Eisenstein series, where \widehat{\omega}_N is a normalized metric Hodge line bundle.;math.NT
1801.01820;Design and Implementation of a Polar Codes Blind Detection Scheme;In blind detection, a set of candidates has to be decoded within a strict time constraint, to identify which transmissions are directed at the user equipment. Blind detection is required by the 3GPP LTE/LTE-Advanced standard, and it will be required in the 5th generation wireless communication standard (5G) as well. Polar codes have been selected for use in 5G: thus, the issue of blind detection of polar codes must be addressed. We propose a polar code blind detection scheme where the user ID is transmitted instead of some of the frozen bits. A first, coarse decoding phase helps selecting a subset of candidates that is decoded by a more powerful algorithm: an early stopping criterion is also introduced for the second decoding phase. Simulations results show good missed detection and false alarm rates, along with substantial latency gains thanks to early stopping. We then propose an architecture to implement the devised blind detection scheme, based on a tunable decoder that can be used for both phases. The architecture is synthesized and implementation results are reported for various system parameters. The reported area occupation and latency, obtained in 65 nm CMOS technology, are able to meet 5G requirements, and are guaranteed to meet them with even less resource usage in the latest technology nodes.;cs.IT
1801.01826;Compactifiable classes of compacta;We introduce the notion of compactifiable classes -- these are classes of metrizable compact spaces that can be up to homeomorphic copies ``disjointly combined'' into one metrizable compact space. This is witnessed by so-called compact composition of the class. Analogously, we consider Polishable classes and Polish compositions. The question of compactifiability or Polishability of a class is related to hyperspaces. Strongly compactifiable and strongly Polishable classes may be characterized by the existence of a corresponding family in the hyperspace of all metrizable compacta. We systematically study the introduced notions -- we give several characterizations, consider preservation under various constructions, and raise several questions.;math.GN
1801.01830;Multipliers in Bessel potential spaces. The case of different sign smooth indices;The objective of this paper is to describe the space of multipliers acting from a Bessel potential space $H^s_p(\mathbb R^n)$ into another space $H^{-t}_q(\mathbb R^n)$, provided that the smooth indices of these spaces have different signs, i.e. $s, t \geqslant 0$. This space of multipliers consists of distributions $u$, such that for all $\varphi \in H^s_p(\mathbb R^n)$ the product $\varphi \cdot u$ is well-defined and belongs to the space $H^{-t}_q(\mathbb R^n)$. We succeed to describe this space explicitly, provided that $p \leqslant q$ and one of the following conditions $$ s \geqslant t \geqslant 0, \ s &gt, n/p \ \ \, \text{or} \ \ \, t \geqslant s \geqslant 0, \ t &gt, n/q' \quad (\: \text{where} \, 1/q +1/q' = 1), $$ holds. In this case one has $$ M[H^s_p(\mathbb{R}^n) \to H^{-t}_{q}(\mathbb{R}^n)] = H^{-t}_{q, \: unif}(\mathbb{R}^n) \cap H^{-s}_{p', \: unif}(\mathbb{R}^n), $$ where $H^\gamma_{r, \: unif}(\mathbb{R}^n), \: \gamma \in \mathbb{R}, \: r &gt, 1$ is the scale of uniformly localized Bessel potential spaces. <br />In particular but important case $s = t &lt, n/\max (p,q')$ we prove two-sided continuous embeddings $$ H^{-s}_{r_1, \: unif}(\mathbb{R}^n) \subset M[H^s_p(\mathbb{R}^n) \to H^{-s}_q(\mathbb{R}^n)] \subset H^{-s}_{r_2, \: unif}(\mathbb{R}^n), $$ where $r_2 = \max (p', q), \ r_1 =[s/n-(1/p -1/q)]^{-1}$.;math.FA
1801.01833;Seymour&#x27,s conjecture on 2-connected graphs of large pathwidth;We prove the conjecture of Seymour (1993) that for every apex-forest $H_1$ and outerplanar graph $H_2$ there is an integer $p$ such that every 2-connected graph of pathwidth at least $p$ contains $H_1$ or $H_2$ as a minor. An independent proof was recently obtained by Dang and Thomas.;math.CO
1801.01838;A Bramble-Pasciak conjugate gradient method for discrete Stokes equations with random viscosity;We study the iterative solution of linear systems of equations arising from stochastic Galerkin finite element discretizations of saddle point problems. We focus on the Stokes model with random data parametrized by uniformly distributed random variables and discuss well-posedness of the variational formulations. We introduce a Bramble-Pasciak conjugate gradient method as a linear solver. It builds on a non-standard inner product associated with a block triangular preconditioner. The block triangular structure enables more sophisticated preconditioners than the block diagonal structure usually applied in MINRES methods. We show how the existence requirements of a conjugate gradient method can be met in our setting. We analyze the performance of the solvers depending on relevant physical and numerical parameters by means of eigenvalue estimates. For this purpose, we derive bounds for the eigenvalues of the relevant preconditioned sub-matrices. We illustrate our findings using the flow in a driven cavity as a numerical test case, where the viscosity is given by a truncated Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion of a random field. In this example, a Bramble-Pasciak conjugate gradient method with block triangular preconditioner outperforms a MINRES method with block diagonal preconditioner in terms of iteration numbers.;math.NA
1801.01839;Characterization of rational matrices that admit finite digit representations;Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ matrix with rational entries and let \[ \mathbb{Z}^n[A] := \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( \mathbb{Z}^n + A\mathbb{Z}^n + \dots + A^{k-1}\mathbb{Z}^n\right) \] be the minimal $A$-invariant $\mathbb{Z}$-module containing the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$. If $\mathcal{D}\subset\mathbb{Z}^n[A]$ is a finite set we call the pair $(A,\mathcal{D})$ a digit system. We say that $(A,\mathcal{D})$ has the finiteness property if each $\mathbf{z} \in \mathbb{Z}^n[A]$ can be written in the form \[ \mathbf{z} = \mathbf{d}_0 + A\mathbf{d}_1 + \dots + A^k\mathbf{d}_k, \] with $k\in\mathbb{N}$ and digits $\mathbf{d}_j \in \mathcal{D}$ for $0\le j\le k$. We prove that for a given matrix $A \in M_n(\mathbb{Q})$ there is a finite set $\mathcal{D}\subset\mathbb{Z}^n[A]$ such that $(A, \mathcal{D})$ has the finiteness property if and only if $A$ has no eigenvalue of absolute value $&lt, 1$. This result is the matrix analogue of the height reducing property of algebraic numbers. In proving this result we also characterize integer polynomials $P \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ that admit digit systems having the finiteness property in the quotient ring $\mathbb{Z}[x]/(P)$.;math.NT
1801.01850;Hyperbolic HHS II: Graphs of hierarchically hyperbolic groups;In this paper we consider a large family of graphs of hierarchically hyperbolic groups (HHG) and show that their fundamental groups admit HHG structures. To do that, we will investigate the notion of hierarchical quasi convexity and show that for a hyperbolic HHS it coincides with the notion of quasi-convexity. The main technical result, for which we expect further applications, is that it is possible to incorporate the HHG structure of a hierarchically hyperbolically embedded subgroup into the HHG structure of the ambient group. This generalizes and provides some additional details to a procedure described in [DHS17].;math.GR
1801.01857;On the Kahler-Einstein metric at strictly pseudoconvex points;We prove a local boundary regularity result for the complete Kahler-Einstein metrics of negative Ricci curvature near strictly pseudoconvex boundary point. We also study the asymptotic behaviour of their holomorphic bisectional curvatures near such points.;math.DG
1801.01858;Special moves for open book decompositions of 3-manifolds;We provide a complete set of two moves that suffice to relate any two open book decompositions of a given 3-manifold. One of the moves is the usual plumbing with a positive or negative Hopf band, while the other one is a special local version of Harer's twisting, which is presented in two different (but stably equivalent) forms. Our approach relies on 4-dimensional Lefschetz fibrations, and on 3-dimensional contact topology, via the Giroux-Goodman stable equivalence theorem for open book decompositions representing homologous contact structures.;math.GT
1801.01859;The Arbitrarily Varying Relay Channel;We study the arbitrarily varying relay channel, and establish the cutset bound and partial decode-forward bound on the random code capacity. We further determine the random code capacity for special cases. Then, we consider conditions under which the deterministic code capacity is determined as well.;cs.IT
1801.01860;Controllability of the Navier-Stokes equation in a rectangle with a little help of a distributed phantom force;We consider the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation in a rectangle with the usual no-slip boundary condition prescribed on the upper and lower boundaries. We prove that for any positive time, for any finite energy initial data, there exist controls on the left and right boundaries and a distributed force, which can be chosen arbitrarily small in any Sobolev norm in space, such that the corresponding solution is at rest at the given final time. <br />Our work improves earlier results where the distributed force is small only in a negative Sobolev space. It is a further step towards an answer to Jacques-Louis Lions' question about the small-time global exact boundary controllability of the Navier-Stokes equation with the no-slip boundary condition, for which no distributed force is allowed. <br />Our analysis relies on the well-prepared dissipation method already used for Burgers and for Navier-Stokes in the case of the Navier slip-with-friction boundary condition. In order to handle the larger boundary layers associated with the no-slip boundary condition, we perform a preliminary regularization into analytic functions with arbitrarily large analytic radius and prove a long-time nonlinear Cauchy-Kovalevskaya estimate relying only on horizontal analyticity.;math.AP
1801.01864;An asymptotic bound for Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of certain Ext modules over graded complete intersection rings;Set $ A := Q/({\bf z}) $, where $ Q $ is a polynomial ring over a field, and $ {\bf z} = z_1,\ldots,z_c $ is a homogeneous $ Q $-regular sequence. Let $ M $ and $ N $ be finitely generated graded $ A $-modules, and $ I $ be a homogeneous ideal of $ A $. We show that <br />(1) $ \mathrm{reg}\left( \mathrm{Ext}_A^{i}(M, I^nN) \right) \le \rho_N(I) \cdot n - f \cdot \left\lfloor \frac{i}{2} \right\rfloor + b \mbox{ for all } i, n \ge 0 $, <br />(2) $ \mathrm{reg}\left( \mathrm{Ext}_A^{i}(M,N/I^nN) \right) \le \rho_N(I) \cdot n - f \cdot \left\lfloor \frac{i}{2} \right\rfloor + b' \mbox{ for all } i, n \ge 0 $, <br />where $ b $ and $ b' $ are some constants, $ f := \mathrm{min}\{ \mathrm{deg}(z_j) : 1 \le j \le c \} $, and $ \rho_N(I) $ is an invariant defined in terms of reduction ideals of $ I $ with respect to $ N $. There are explicit examples which show that these inequalities are sharp.;math.AC
1801.01866;The Reeb Graph Edit Distance is Universal;We consider the setting of Reeb graphs of piecewise linear functions and study distances between them that are stable, meaning that functions which are similar in the supremum norm ought to have similar Reeb graphs. We define an edit distance for Reeb graphs and prove that it is stable and universal, meaning that it provides an upper bound to any other stable distance. In contrast, via a specific construction, we show that the interleaving distance and the functional distortion distance on Reeb graphs are not universal.;math.AT
1801.01867;Limit-Periodic Schr&#xf6,dinger Operators With Lipschitz Continuous IDS;We show that there exist limit-periodic Schr\"odinger operators such that the associated integrated density of states is Lipschitz continuous. These operators arise in the inverse spectral theoretic KAM approach of P\"oschel.;math.SP
1801.01868;Multiplicity results and qualitative properties for semilinear elliptic problems with Neumann boundary conditions;In this paper we study multiplicity and qualitative behavior of solutions for semilinear elliptic problems with neumann boundary condition and asymptotically linear smooth nonlinearity. We provide sufficient conditions on the number of eigenvalues the derivative of the nonlinearity crosses to guarantee existence of at least five nontrivial solutions. The techniques we use are a combination of minimization, Leray-Schauder degree, Morse Theory and Reduction method a la Castro-Lazer.;math.AP
1801.01873;When is $X\times Y$ homeomorphic to $X\times_l Y$?;We identify a class of linearly ordered topological spaces $X$ that may satisfy the property that $X\times X$ is homeomorphic to $X\times_l X$ or can be embedded into a linearly ordered space with the stated property. We justify the conjectures by partial results.;math.GN
1801.01875;Near Optimal Coded Data Shuffling for Distributed Learning;Data shuffling between distributed cluster of nodes is one of the critical steps in implementing large-scale learning algorithms. Randomly shuffling the data-set among a cluster of workers allows different nodes to obtain fresh data assignments at each learning epoch. This process has been shown to provide improvements in the learning process. However, the statistical benefits of distributed data shuffling come at the cost of extra communication overhead from the master node to worker nodes, and can act as one of the major bottlenecks in the overall time for computation. There has been significant recent interest in devising approaches to minimize this communication overhead. One approach is to provision for extra storage at the computing nodes. The other emerging approach is to leverage coded communication to minimize the overall communication overhead. <br />The focus of this work is to understand the fundamental trade-off between the amount of storage and the communication overhead for distributed data shuffling. In this work, we first present an information theoretic formulation for the data shuffling problem, accounting for the underlying problem parameters (number of workers, $K$, number of data points, $N$, and the available storage, $S$ per node). We then present an information theoretic lower bound on the communication overhead for data shuffling as a function of these parameters. We next present a novel coded communication scheme and show that the resulting communication overhead of the proposed scheme is within a multiplicative factor of at most $\frac{K}{K-1}$ from the information-theoretic lower bound. Furthermore, we present the aligned coded shuffling scheme for some storage values, which achieves the optimal storage vs communication trade-off for $K&lt,5$, and further reduces the maximum multiplicative gap down to $\frac{K-\frac{1}{3}}{K-1}$, for $K\geq 5$.;cs.IT
1801.01878;A rank 2 Dijkgraaf-Moore-Verlinde-Verlinde formula;We conjecture a formula for the virtual elliptic genera of moduli spaces of rank 2 sheaves on minimal surfaces $S$ of general type. We express our conjecture in terms of the Igusa cusp form $\chi_{10}$ and Borcherds type lifts of three quasi-Jacobi forms which are all related to the Weierstrass elliptic function. We also conjecture that the generating function of virtual cobordism classes of these moduli spaces depends only on $\chi(\mathcal{O}_S)$ and $K_S^2$ via two universal functions, one of which is determined by the cobordism classes of Hilbert schemes of points on $K3$. We present generalizations of these conjectures, e.g. to arbitrary surfaces with $p_g&gt,0$ and $b_1=0$. <br />We use a result of J. Shen to express the virtual cobordism class in terms of descendent Donaldson invariants. In a prequel we used T. Mochizuki's formula, universality, and toric calculations to compute such Donaldson invariants in the setting of virtual $\chi_y$-genera. Similar techniques allow us to verify our new conjectures in many cases.;math.AG
1801.01897;Power Kripke-Platek set theory and the axiom of choice;Whilst Power Kripke-Platek set theory, KPP, shares many properties with ordinary Kripke-Platek set theory, KP, in several ways it behaves quite differently from KP. This is perhaps most strikingly demonstrated by a result, due to Mathias, to the effect that adding the axiom of constructibility to KPP gives rise to a much stronger theory, whereas in the case of KP the constructible hierarchy provides an inner model, so that KP and KP+V=L have the same strength. This paper will be concerned with the relationship between KPP and KPP plus the axiom of choice or even the global axiom of choice, GAC. Since L is the standard vehicle to furnish a model in which this axiom holds, the usual argument for demonstrating that the addition of AC or GAC to KPP does not increase proof-theoretic strength does not apply in any obvious way. Among other tools, the paper uses techniques from ordinal analysis to show that KPP+GAC has the same strength as KPP, thereby answering a question of Mathias. Moreover, it is shown that KPP+GAC is conservative over KPP for Pi-1-4 statements of analysis. The method of ordinal analysis for theories with power set was developed in an earlier paper. The technique allows one to compute witnessing information from infinitary proofs, providing bounds for the transfinite iterations of the power set operation that are provable in a theory. As the theory KPP+GAC provides a very useful tool for defining models and realizability models of other theories that are hard to construct without access to a uniform selection mechanism, it is desirable to determine its exact proof-theoretic strength. This knowledge can for instance be used to determine the strength of Feferman's operational set theory with power set operation as well as constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice.;math.LO
1801.01898;Natural proof of the characterization of relatively compact families in $L^p-$spaces on locally compact groups;In the paper we look for an elegant proof of the characterization of relatively compact families in $L^p-$spaces. At first glance, the suggested approach may seem convoluted and lengthy, but we spare no effort to argue that our proof is in fact more natural than the ones existent in the literature. The key idea is that the three properties which characterize relative compactness in $L^p-$spaces ($L^p-$boundedness, $L^p-$equicontinuity and $L^p-$equivanishing) are "preserved" (or rather "inherited") when the family $\Ffamily\subset L^p$ is convolved with a continuous and compactly supported function. This new family turns out to be relatively compact in $C_0-$space and it remains to be demonstrated that relative compactness in $C_0-$space implies relative compactness of the original family $\Ffamily.$;math.FA
1801.01906;Rankin-Cohen brackets and Serre derivatives as Poincar&#xe9, series;We give expressions for the Serre derivatives of Eisenstein and Poincar\'e series as well as their Rankin-Cohen brackets with arbitrary modular forms in terms of the Poincar\'e averaging construction, and derive several identities for the Ramanujan tau function as applications.;math.NT
1801.01908;Structural Logic and Abstract Elementary Classes with Intersection;We give a syntactic characterization of abstract elementary classes (AECs) closed under intersections using a new logic with a quantifier for isomorphism types that we call structural logic: we prove that AECs with intersections correspond to classes of models of a universal theory in structural logic. This generalizes Tarski's syntactic characterization of universal classes. As a corollary, we obtain that any AEC with countable L\"owenheim-Skolem number is axiomatizable in $\mathbb{L}_{\infty, \omega} (Q)$, where $Q$ is the quantifier "there exists uncountably many".;math.LO
1801.01911;Descriptive Cellular Homology;This article introduces descriptive cellular homology on cell complexes, which is an extension of J.H.C. Whitehead's CW topology. A main result is that a descriptive cellular complex is a topology on fibres in a fibre bundle. An application of two forms of cellular homology is given in terms of the persistence of shapes in CW spaces.;math.GT
1801.01915;An application of the partial r-Bell polynomials on some family of bivariate polynomials;The aim of this paper is to give some combinatorial relations linked polynomials generalizing those of Appell type to the partial r-Bell polynomials. We give an inverse relation, recurrence relations involving some family of polynomials and their exact expressions at rational values in terms of the partial r-Bell polynomials. We illustrate the obtained results by various comprehensive examples.;math.CO
1801.01917;Multiplicative operators in the spectral problem of integrable systems;We consider the spectral problem of the Lax pair associated to periodic integrable partial differential equations. We assume this spectral problem to be a polynomial of degree $d$ in the spectral parameter $\lambda$. From this assumption, we find the conservation laws as well as the hyperelliptic curve required to solve the periodic inverse problem. A recursion formula is developed, as well as $d$ additional conditions which give additional information to integrate the equations under consideration. We also include two examples to show how the techniques developed work. For the Korteweg-deVries (KdV) equation, the degree of the multiplicative equation is $d=1$. Hence, we only have one condition and one recursion formula. The condition gives in each degree of the recursion the conserved densities for KdV equation, recovering the Lax hierarchy. For the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation, the degree of the multiplicative operator is $d=2$. Hence, we have a couple of conditions that we use to deduce conserved density constants and the Lax hierarchy for such equation. Additionally, we explicitely write down the hyper-elliptic curve associted to the NLS equation. Our approach can be use for other completely integrable differential equations, as long as we have a polynomial multiplicative operator associated to them.;math.AP
1801.01918;Homogenization of some degenerate pseudoparabolic variational inequalities;Multiscale analysis of a degenerate pseudoparabolic variational inequality, modelling the two-phase flow with dynamical capillary pressure in a perforated domain, is the main topic of this work. Regularisation and penalty operator methods are applied to show the existence of a solution of the nonlinear degenerate pseudoparabolic variational inequality defined in a domain with microscopic perforations, as well as to derive a priori estimates for solutions of the microscopic problem. The main challenge is the derivation of a priori estimates for solutions of the variational inequality, uniformly with respect to the regularisation parameter and to the small parameter defining the scale of the microstructure. The method of two-scale convergence is used to derive the corresponding macroscopic obstacle problem.;math.AP
1801.01924;Green matrix estimates of block Jacobi matrices I: Unbounded gap in the essential spectrum;This work deals with decay bounds for Green matrices and generalized eigenvectors of block Jacobi matrices when the real part of the spectral parameter lies in an infinite gap of the operator's essential spectrum. We consider the cases of commutative and noncommutative matrix entries separately. An example of a block Jacobi operator with noncommutative entries and nonnegative essential spectrum is given to illustrate the results.;math-ph
1801.01925;The reciprocal sum of primitive nondeficient numbers;We investigate the reciprocal sum of primitive nondeficient numbers, or pnds. In 1934, Erdos showed that the reciprocal sum of pnds converges, which he used to prove that the abundant numbers have a natural density. We show the reciprocal sum of pnds is between 0.348 and 0.380.;math.NT
1801.01931;Magnetic oscillations in a model of graphene;We consider a quantum graph as a model of graphene in constant magnetic field and describe the density of states in terms of relativistic Landau levels satisfying a Bohr--Sommerfeld quantization condition. That provides semiclassical corrections (with the magnetic flux as the semiclassical parameter) in the study of magnetic oscillations.;math-ph
1801.01934;Universality results for kinetically constrained spin models in two dimensions;Kinetically constrained models (KCM) are reversible interacting particle systems on $\mathbb Z^d$ with continuous time Markov dynamics of Glauber type, which represent a natural stochastic (and non-monotone) counterpart of the family of cellular automata known as $\mathcal U$-bootstrap percolation. KCM also display some of the peculiar features of the so-called "glassy dynamics", and as such they are extensively used in the physics literature to model the liquid-glass transition, a major and longstanding open problem in condensed matter physics. <br />We consider two-dimensional KCM with update rule $\mathcal U$, and focus on proving universality results for the mean infection time of the origin, in the same spirit as those recently established in the setting of $\mathcal U$-bootstrap percolation. We first identify what we believe are the correct universality classes, which turn out to be different from those of $\mathcal U$-bootstrap percolation. We then prove universal upper bounds on the mean infection time within each class, which we conjecture to be sharp up to logarithmic corrections. In certain cases, including all supercritical models, and the well-known Duarte model, our conjecture has recently been confirmed in [MMT]. In fact, in these cases our upper bound is sharp up to a constant factor in the exponent. For certain classes of update rules, it turns out that the infection time of the KCM diverges much faster than for the corresponding $\mathcal U$-bootstrap process when the equilibrium density of infected sites goes to zero. This is due to the occurrence of energy barriers which determine the dominant behaviour for KCM, but which do not matter for the monotone bootstrap dynamics.;math.PR
1801.01938;A note on Arithmetic Diophantine series;We consider some asymptotic analysis for series related to the work of Hardy and Littlewood on Diophantine approximation, as well as Davenport. In particular, we expand on ideas from some previous work on arithmetic series and the RH.;math.NT
1801.01940;A spiral interface with positive Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman limit at the origin;We give an example of a pair of nonnegative subharmonic functions with disjoint support for which the Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman monotonicity formula has strictly positive limit at the origin, and yet the interface between their supports lacks a (unique) tangent there. This clarifies a remark appearing in the literature (see \cite{cs05}) that the positivity of the limit of the ACF formula implies unique tangents, this is true under some additional assumptions, but false in general. In our example, blow-ups converge to the expected piecewise linear two-plane function along subsequences, but the limiting function depends on the subsequence due to the spiraling nature of the interface.;math.AP
1801.01942;Vanishing theorems for representation homology and the derived cotangent complex;Let $G$ be a reductive affine algebraic group defined over a field $k$ of characteristic zero. In this paper, we study the cotangent complex of the derived $G$-representation scheme $ {\rm DRep}_G(X)$ of a pointed connected topological space $X$. We use an (algebraic version of) unstable Adams spectral sequence relating the cotangent homology of $ {\rm DRep}_G(X) $ to the representation homology $ {\rm HR}_*(X,G) := \pi_*{\mathcal O}[{\rm DRep}_G(X)] $ to prove some vanishing theorems for groups and geometrically interesting spaces. Our examples include virtually free groups, Riemann surfaces, link complements in $ {\mathbb R}^3 $ and generalized lens spaces. In particular, for any f.g. virtually free group $ \Gamma $, we show that $\, {\rm HR}_i({\rm B}\Gamma, G) = 0 \,$ for all $ i &gt, 0 $. For a closed Riemann surface $\Sigma_g $ of genus $ g \ge 1 $, we have $\, {\rm HR}_i(\Sigma_g, G) = 0 \,$ for all $ i &gt, \dim G $. The sharp vanishing bounds for $ \Sigma_g $ depend actually on the genus: we conjecture that if $ g = 1 $, then $\, {\rm HR}_i(\Sigma_g, G) = 0 \,$ for $ i &gt, {\rm rank}\,G $, and if $ g \ge 2 $, then $\, {\rm HR}_i(\Sigma_g, G) = 0 \,$ for $ i &gt, \dim\,{\mathcal Z}(G) \,$, where $ {\mathcal Z}(G) $ is the center of $G$. We prove these bounds locally on the smooth locus of the representation scheme $ {\rm Rep}_G[\pi_1(\Sigma_g)]\,$ in the case of complex connected reductive groups. One important consequence of our results is the existence of a well-defined $K$-theoretic virtual fundamental class for $ {\rm DRep}_G(X)$ in the sense of Ciocan-Fontanine and Kapranov. We give a new `Tor formula' for this class in terms of functor homology.;math.AT
1801.01945;Quadrilaterals inscribed in convex curves;We classify the set of quadrilaterals that can be inscribed in convex Jordan curves, in the continuous as well as in the smooth case. This answers a question of Makeev in the special case of convex curves. The difficulty of this problem comes from the fact that standard topological arguments to prove the existence of solutions do not apply here due to the lack of sufficient symmetry. Instead, the proof makes use of an area argument of Karasev and Tao, which we furthermore simplify and elaborate on. The continuous case requires an additional analysis of the singular points, and a small miracle, which then extends to show that the problems of inscribing isosceles trapezoids in smooth curves and in piecewise $C^1$ curves are equivalent.;math.MG
1801.01962;Expansion of Iterated Stratonovich Stochastic Integrals of Multiplicity 2 Based on Double Fourier-Legendre Series Summarized by Pringsheim Method;The article is devoted to the expansion of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of second multiplicity into the double series of products of standard Gaussian random variables. The proof of expansion is based on the application of double Fourier-Legendre series summarized by Pringsheim method. The results of the article can be applied to the numerical integration of Ito stochastic differential equations.;math.PR
1801.01963;Cluster algebra structures on Poisson nilpotent algebras;Various coordinate rings of varieties appearing in the theory of Poisson Lie groups and Poisson homogeneous spaces belong to the large, axiomatically defined class of symmetric Poisson nilpotent algebras, e.g. coordinate rings of Schubert cells for symmetrizable Kac--Moody groups. We prove that every Poisson nilpotent algebra satisfying a mild condition on certain scalars is canonically isomorphic to a cluster algebra which coincides with the corresponding upper cluster algebra, without additional localizations by frozen variables. The constructed cluster structure is compatible with the Poisson structure in the sense of Gekhtman, Shapiro and Vainshtein. All Poisson nilpotent algebras are proved to be equivariant Poisson Unique Factorization Domains. Their seeds are constructed from sequences of Poisson-prime elements for chains of Poisson UFDs, mutation matrices are effectively determined from linear systems in terms of the underlying Poisson structure. Uniqueness, existence, mutation, and other properties are established for these sequences of Poisson-prime elements.;math.AC
1801.01965;Restrictions on Potential Automatic Structures on Thompson&#x27,s Group F;We show that a large class of languages in the standard finite generating set X = {$x_0, x_1, x_0^{-1}, x_1^{-1}$} cannot be part of an automatic structure for Thompson's Group F. These languages are ones that accept at least one representative of each element of F of word length that is within a fixed constant of a geodesic representative of the element. To accomplish this, we look at a specific element of F and trace two different paths through the Cayley graph to that element. We show that staying within the length restrictions along these two paths would force that element to have contradictory properties.;math.GR
1801.01975;A construction of sequentially Cohen-Macaulay graphs;For every simple graph $G$, a class of multiple clique cluster-whiskered graphs $G^{md}$ is introduced, and it is shown that all graphs $G^{md}$ are vertex decomposable, thus the independence simplicial complex ${\rm Ind}\,G^{md}$ is sequentially Cohen-Macaulay, the properties of the graphs $G^{md}$ and the clique-whiskered graph $G^\pi$ are studied, including the enumeration of facets of the complex ${\rm Ind}\, G^{\pi}$ and, the calculation of Betti numbers of the cover ideal $I_c(G^{md})$.;math.AC
1801.01976;Standing waves for quasilinear Schr&#xf6,inger equations with indefinite potentials;We consider quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ of the form% \[ -\Delta u+V(x)u-u\Delta(u^{2})=g(u)\text{,}% \] where $g(u)$ is $4$-superlinear. Unlike all known results in the literature, the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $-\Delta+V$ is allowed to be indefinite, hence the variational functional does not satisfy the mountain pass geometry. By a local linking argument and Morse theory, we obtain a nontrivial solution for the problem. In case that $g$ is odd, we get an unbounded sequence of solutions.;math.AP
1801.01977;On varieties of groups generated by wreath products of abelian groups;Generalizing results of Higman and Houghton on varieties generated by wreath products of finite cycles, we prove that the (direct or cartesian) wreath product of arbitrary abelian groups $A$ and $B$ generates the product variety $var (A) \cdot var (B)$ if and only if one of the groups $A$ and $B$ is not of finite exponent, or if $A$ and $B$ are of finite exponents $m$ and $n$ respectively and for all primes $p$ dividing both $m$ and $n$, the factors $B[p^k]/B[p^{k-1}]$ are infinite, where $B[s]=\langle b\in B|\,b^{s}=1 \rangle$ and where $p^k$ is the highest power of $p$ dividing $n$.;math.GR
1801.01978;Trainable ISTA for Sparse Signal Recovery;In this paper, we propose a novel sparse signal recovery algorithm called Trainable ISTA (TISTA). The proposed algorithm consists of two estimation units such as a linear estimation unit and a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimator-based shrinkage unit. The estimated error variance required in the MMSE shrinkage unit is precisely estimated from a tentative estimate of the original signal. The remarkable feature of the proposed scheme is that TISTA includes adjustable variables controlling a step size and the error variance for the MMSE shrinkage. The variables are adjusted by standard deep learning techniques. The number of trainable variables of TISTA is equal to the number of iteration rounds and it is much smaller than that of known learnable sparse signal recovery algorithms. This feature leads to highly stable and fast training processes of TISTA. Computer experiments show that TISTA is applicable to various classes of sensing matrices such as Gaussian matrices, binary matrices and matrices with large condition numbers. Numerical results also demonstrate that TISTA shows significantly faster convergence than those of AMP and LISTA in many cases.;cs.IT
1801.01982;Refinements of Levenshtein bounds in $q$-ary Hamming spaces;We develop refinements of the Levenshtein bound in $q$-ary Hamming spaces by taking into account the discrete nature of the distances versus the continuous behavior of certain parameters used by Levenshtein. The first relevant cases are investigated in detail and new bounds are presented. In particular, we derive generalizations and $q$-ary analogs of a MacEliece bound. We provide evidence that our approach is as good as the complete linear programming and discuss how faster are our calculations. Finally, we present a table with parameters of codes which, if exist, would attain our bounds.;cs.IT
1801.01985;Algebraic curves $A^{\circ l}(x)-U(y)=0$ and arithmetic of orbits of rational functions;We give a description of pairs of complex rational functions $A$ and $U$ of degree at least two such that for every $d\geq 1$ the algebraic curve $A^{\circ d}(x)-U(y)=0$ has a factor of genus zero or one. In particular, we show that if $A$ is not a `generalized Latt\`es map', then this condition is satisfied if and only if there exists a rational function $V$ such that $U\circ V=A^{\circ l}$ for some $l\geq 1.$ We also prove a version of the dynamical Mordell-Lang conjecture, concerning intersections of orbits of points from $\mathbb P^1(K)$ under iterates of $A$ with the value set $U(\mathbb P^1(K))$, where $A$ and $U$ are rational functions defined over a number field $K.$;math.DS
1801.01992;Locally convex spaces and Schur type properties;In the main result of the paper we extend Rosenthal's characterization of Banach spaces with the Schur property by showing that for a quasi-complete locally convex space $E$ whose separable bounded sets are metrizable the following conditions are equivalent: (1) $E$ has the Schur property, (2) $E$ and $E_w$ have the same sequentially compact sets, where $E_w$ is the space $E$ with the weak topology, (3) $E$ and $E_w$ have the same compact sets, (4) $E$ and $E_w$ have the same countably compact sets, (5) $E$ and $E_w$ have the same pseudocompact sets, (6) $E$ and $E_w$ have the same functionally bounded sets, (7) every bounded non-precompact sequence in $E$ has a subsequence which is equivalent to the unit basis of $\ell_1$ and (8) every bounded non-precompact sequence in $E$ has a subsequence which is discrete and $C$-embedded in $E_w$.;math.FA
1801.01994;The proximal alternating direction method of multipliers in the nonconvex setting: convergence analysis and rates;We propose two numerical algorithms in the fully nonconvex setting for the minimization of the sum of a smooth function and the composition of a nonsmooth function with a linear operator. The iterative schemes are formulated in the spirit of the proximal alternating direction method of multipliers and its linearized variant, respectively. The proximal terms are introduced via variable metrics, a fact which allows us to derive new proximal splitting algorithms for nonconvex structured optimization problems, as particular instances of the general schemes. Under mild conditions on the sequence of variable metrics and by assuming that a regularization of the associated augmented Lagrangian has the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property, we prove that the iterates converge to a KKT point of the objective function. By assuming that the augmented Lagrangian has the Lojasiewicz property, we also derive convergence rates for both the augmented Lagrangian and the iterates.;math.OC
1801.01998;On locally compact semitopological graph inverse semigroups;In this paper we investigate locally compact semitopological graph inverse semigroups. Our main result is the following: if a directed graph $E$ is strongly connected and contains a finite amount of vertices then a locally compact semitopological graph inverse semigroup $G(E)$ is either compact or discrete. This result generalizes results of Gutik and Bardyla who proved the above dichotomy for locally compact semitopological polycyclic monoids $\mathcal{P}_1$ and $\mathcal{P}_{\lambda}$, respectively.;math.GN
1801.02002;Antipodal sets in infinite dimensional Banach spaces;The following strengthening of the Elton-Odell theorem on the existence of a $(1+\epsilon)-$separated sequences in the unit sphere $S_X$ of an infinite dimensional Banach space $X$ is proved: There exists an infinite subset $S\subseteq S_X$ and a constant $d&gt,1$, satisfying the property that for every $x,y\in S$ with $x\neq y$ there exists $f\in B_{X^*}$ such that $d\leq f(x)-f(y)$ and $f(y)\leq f(z)\leq f(x)$, for all $z\in S$.;math.FA
1801.02006;Products of locally compact spaces are k_R-spaces;A theorem by Norman L. Noble from 1970 asserts that every product of completely regular, locally pseudo-compact k_R-spaces is a k_R-space. As a consequence, all direct products of locally compact Hausdorff spaces are k_R-spaces. We provide a streamlined proof for this fact.;math.GN
1801.02008;Recovery of an embedded obstacle and the surrounding medium for Maxwell&#x27,s system;In this paper, we are concerned with the inverse electromagnetic scattering problem of recovering a complex scatterer by the corresponding electric far-field data. The complex scatterer consists of an inhomogeneous medium and a possibly embedded perfectly electric conducting (PEC) obstacle. The far-field data are collected corresponding to incident plane waves with a fixed incident direction and a fixed polarisation, but frequencies from an open interval. It is shown that the embedded obstacle can be uniquely recovered by the aforementioned far-field data, independent of the surrounding medium. Furthermore, if the surrounding medium is piecewise homogeneous, then the medium can be recovered as well. Those unique recovery results are new to the literature. Our argument is based on low-frequency expansions of the electromagnetic fields and certain harmonic analysis techniques.;math.AP
1801.02009;Probabilistic DHP Adaptive Critic for Nonlinear Stochastic Control Systems;Following the recently developed algorithms for fully probabilistic control design for general dynamic stochastic systems [15], [18], this paper presents the solution to the probabilistic dual heuristic programming (DHP) adaptive critic method [15] and randomized control algorithm for stochastic nonlinear dynamical systems. The purpose of the randomized control input design is to make the joint probability density function of the closed loop system as close as possible to a predetermined ideal joint probability density function. This paper completes the previous work [15], [18] by formulating and solving the fully probabilistic control design problem on the more general case of nonlinear stochastic discrete time systems. A simulated example is used to demonstrate the use of the algorithm and encouraging results have been obtained.;math.OC
1801.02010;On decoding procedures of intertwining codes;One of the main weakness of the family of centralizer codes is that its length is always $n^2$. Thus we have taken a new matrix equation code called intertwining code. Specialty of this code is the length of it, which is of the form $nk$. We establish two decoding methods which can be fitted to intertwining codes as well as for any linear codes. We also show an inclusion of linear codes into a special class of intertwining codes.;cs.IT
1801.02011;Wave model of the regular Sturm-Liouville operator;We describe the wave functional model for the minimal (symmetric) Sturm-Liouville operator on the finite interval. We construct the wave spectrum of this operator, then, following the abstract scheme, we construct the model space of functions on the wave spectrum and introduce in that space the model operator. The latter is a matrix Sturm-Liouville operator which is unitarily equivalent to the original.;math-ph
1801.02012;The Absolute of finitely generated groups: I. Commutative groups;We give a complete description of the absolute of commutative finitely generated groups and semigroups. The absolute (previously called the exit boundary) is a further elaboration of the notion of the boundary of a random walk on a group (the Poisson--Furstenberg boundary), namely, the absolute of a (semi)group is the set of ergodic central measures on the compactum of all infinite trajectories of a simple random walk on the group. Related notions have been discussed in the probability literature: Martin boundary, entrance and exit boundaries (Dynkin), central measures on path spaces of graphs (Vershik--Kerov). A central measure (with respect to a finite system of generators of a group or semigroup) is a Markov measure on the space of trajectories whose cotransition distribution at every point is the uniform distribution on the generators (i.e., a measure of maximal entropy). For a more general notion of measures with a given cocycle. For the group~$\Bbb Z$, the problem of describing the absolute is solved exactly by the classical de~Finetti's theorem. The main result of this paper, which is a far-reaching generalization of de~Finetti's theorem, is as follows: the absolute of a commutative semigroup coincides with the set of central measures corresponding to (nonstationary) Markov chains with independent identically distributed increments. Topologically, the absolute is (in the main case) a closed disk of finite dimension.;math.GR
1801.02013;Multiscale Sparse Microcanonical Models;We study approximations of non-Gaussian stationary processes having long range correlations with microcanonical models. These models are conditioned by the empirical value of an energy vector, evaluated on a single realization. Asymptotic properties of maximum entropy microcanonical and macrocanonical processes and their convergence to Gibbs measures are reviewed. We show that the Jacobian of the energy vector controls the entropy rate of microcanonical processes. <br />Sampling maximum entropy processes through MCMC algorithms require too many operations when the number of constraints is large. We define microcanonical gradient descent processes by transporting a maximum entropy measure with a gradient descent algorithm which enforces the energy conditions. Convergence and symmetries are analyzed. Approximations of non-Gaussian processes with long range interactions are defined with multiscale energy vectors computed with wavelet and scattering transforms. Sparsity properties are captured with $\bf l^1$ norms. Approximations of Gaussian, Ising and point processes are studied, as well as image and audio texture synthesis.;math-ph
1801.02014;A Class of MSR Codes for Clustered Distributed Storage;Clustered distributed storage models real data centers where intra- and cross-cluster repair bandwidths are different. In this paper, exact-repair minimum-storage-regenerating (MSR) codes achieving capacity of clustered distributed storage are designed. Focus is given on two cases: $\epsilon=0$ and $\epsilon=1/(n-k)$, where $\epsilon$ is the ratio of the available cross- and intra-cluster repair bandwidths, $n$ is the total number of distributed nodes and $k$ is the number of contact nodes in data retrieval. The former represents the scenario where cross-cluster communication is not allowed, while the latter corresponds to the case of minimum cross-cluster bandwidth that is possible under the minimum storage overhead constraint. For the $\epsilon=0$ case, two types of locally repairable codes are proven to achieve the MSR point. As for $\epsilon=1/(n-k)$, an explicit MSR coding scheme is suggested for the two-cluster situation under the specific condition of $n = 2k$.;cs.IT
1801.02015;Reverse and Forward Engineering of Local Voltage Control in Distribution Networks;The increasing penetration of renewable and distributed energy resources in distribution networks calls for real-time and distributed voltage control. In this paper we investigate local Volt/VAR control with a general class of control functions, and show that the power system dynamics with non-incremental local voltage control can be seen as distributed algorithm for solving a well-defined optimization problem (reverse engineering). The reverse engineering further reveals a fundamental limitation of the non-incremental voltage control: the convergence condition is restrictive and prevents better voltage regulation at equilibrium. This motivates us to design two incremental local voltage control schemes based on the subgradient and pseudo-gradient algorithms respectively for solving the same optimization problem (forward engineering). The new control schemes decouple the dynamical property from the equilibrium property, and have much less restrictive convergence conditions. This work presents another step towards developing a new foundation -- network dynamics as optimization algorithms -- for distributed realtime control and optimization of future power networks.;math.OC
1801.02017;On Variational Properties of Quadratic Curvature Functionals;In this paper, we investigate a class of quadratic Riemannian curvature functionals on closed smooth manifold $M$ of dimension $n\ge 3$ on the space of Riemannian metrics on $M$ with unit volume. We study the stability of these functionals at the metric with constant sectional curvature as its critical point.;math.DG
1801.02023;Degree powers in graphs with a forbidden forest;Given a positive integer $p$ and a graph $G$ with degree sequence $d_1,\dots,d_n$, we define $e_p(G)=\sum_{i=1}^n d_i^p$. Caro and Yuster introduced a Tur\'an-type problem for $e_p(G)$: Given a positive integer $p$ and a graph $H$, determine the function $ex_p(n,H)$, which is the maximum value of $e_p(G)$ taken over all graphs $G$ on $n$ vertices that do not contain $H$ as a subgraph. Clearly, $ex_1(n,H)=2ex(n,H)$, where $ex(n,H)$ denotes the classical Tur\'an number. Caro and Yuster determined the function $ex_p(n, P_\ell)$ for sufficiently large $n$, where $p\geq 2$ and $P_\ell$ denotes the path on $\ell$ vertices. In this paper, we generalise this result and determine $ex_p(n,F)$ for sufficiently large $n$, where $p\geq 2$ and $F$ is a linear forest. We also determine $ex_p(n,S)$, where $S$ is a star forest, and $ex_p(n,B)$, where $B$ is a broom graph with diameter at most six.;math.CO
1801.02028;Characterization and Efficient Search of Non-Elementary Trapping Sets of LDPC Codes with Applications to Stopping Sets;In this paper, we propose a characterization for non-elementary trapping sets (NETSs) of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The characterization is based on viewing a NETS as a hierarchy of embedded graphs starting from an ETS. The characterization corresponds to an efficient search algorithm that under certain conditions is exhaustive. As an application of the proposed characterization/search, we obtain lower and upper bounds on the stopping distance $s_{min}$ of LDPC codes. <br />We examine a large number of regular and irregular LDPC codes, and demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of our technique in finding lower and upper bounds on, and in many cases the exact value of, $s_{min}$. Finding $s_{min}$, or establishing search-based lower or upper bounds, for many of the examined codes are out of the reach of any existing algorithm.;cs.IT
1801.02030;Improvements of some operator inequalities involving positive linear maps via the Kantorovich constant;We present some operator inequalities for positive linear maps that generalize and improve the derived results in some recent years. For instant, if $A$ and $B$ are positive operators and $m,m^{'},M,M^{'}$ are positive real numbers satisfying either one of the condition $ 0&lt,m \leq B \leq m^{'} &lt,M^{'} \leq A \leq M $ or $0&lt,m \leq A \leq m^{'} &lt,M^{'} \leq B \leq M$, then \begin{align*} \Phi ^{p} \big(A \nabla _{v} B+2 r Mm (A^{-1}\nabla B^{-1}- &amp,A^{-1} \sharp B^{-1} )\big)\\ &amp, \leq \left( \frac{K(h)}{ 4^{\frac{2}{p}-1} K^{r_{1}} \left( \sqrt {h^{'}}\right)} \right) ^{p} \Phi^{p} (A \sharp_{\nu} B) \end{align*} and \begin{align*} \Phi ^{p} \big(A \nabla _{v} B+2 r Mm (A^{-1}\nabla B^{-1}-&amp, A^{-1} \sharp B^{-1} )\big) \\ &amp,\leq \left( \frac{K(h)}{ 4^{\frac{2}{p}-1} K^{r_{1}}\left( \sqrt {h^{'}}\right)}\right) ^{p} (\Phi(A) \sharp_{\nu} \Phi (B))^{p}, \end{align*} where $\Phi$ is a positive unital linear map, $ 0 \leq \nu \leq 1$, $p \geq 2,$ $r=\min\{\nu,1-\nu\},$ $h=\frac{M}{m},$ $h^{'}=\frac{M^{'}}{m^{'}}$, $K(h)=\frac{(1+h)^{2}}{4h}$ and $r_{1}=\min\{2r,1-2r\}.$ We also obtain a reverse of the Ando inequality for positive linear maps via the Kantorovich constant.;math.FA
1801.02036;Multiscale analysis of semilinear damped stochastic wave equations;In this paper we proceed with the multiscale analysis of semilinear damped stochastic wave motions. The analysis is made by combining the well-known sigma convergence method with its stochastic counterpart, associated to some compactness results such as the Prokhorov and Skorokhod theorems. We derive the equivalent model, which is of the same type as the micro-model.;math.AP
1801.02039;On the existence of global-in-time weak solutions and scaling laws for Kolmogorov&#x27,s two-equation model of turbulence;This paper is concerned with Kolmogorov's two-equation model for the free turbulence in three dimensions. We first discuss scaling laws for slightly more general two-equation models to highlight the special role of the model devised by Kolmogorov in 1942. The main part of the paper consists in proving the existence of weak solutions of Kolmogorov's under space-periodic boundary conditions in a cube. To this end, we provide new a priori estimates and invoke existence result for pseudo-monotone operators.;math.AP

1801.02043;Algorithms for orbit closure separation for invariants and semi-invariants of matrices;We consider two group actions on $m$-tuples of $n \times n$ matrices. The first is simultaneous conjugation by $\operatorname{GL}_n$ and the second is the left-right action of $\operatorname{SL}_n \times \operatorname{SL}_n$. We give efficient algorithms to decide if the orbit closures of two points intersect. We also improve the known bounds for the degree of separating invariants in these cases.;math.RA
1801.02044;Multilabeled versions of Sperner&#x27,s and Fan&#x27,s lemmas and applications;We propose a general technique related to the polytopal Sperner lemma for proving old and new multilabeled versions of Sperner's lemma. A notable application of this technique yields a cake-cutting theorem where the number of players and the number of pieces can be independently chosen. We also prove multilabeled versions of Fan's lemma, a combinatorial analogue of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem, and exhibit applications to fair division and graph coloring.;math.CO
1801.02046;Checking Admissibility Using Natural Dualities;This paper presents a new method for obtaining small algebras to check the admissibility-equivalently, validity in free algebras-of quasi-identities in a finitely generated quasivariety. Unlike a previous algebraic approach of Metcalfe and Rothlisberger that is feasible only when the relevant free algebra is not too large, this method exploits natural dualities for quasivarieties to work with structures of smaller cardinality and surjective rather than injective morphisms. A number of case studies are described here that could not be be solved using the algebraic approach, including (quasi)varieties of MS-algebras, double Stone algebras, and involutive Stone algebras.;math.LO
1801.02050;Statistical estimation of the Shannon entropy;The behavior of the Kozachenko - Leonenko estimates for the (differential) Shannon entropy is studied when the number of i.i.d. vector-valued observations tends to infinity. The asymptotic unbiasedness and L^2-consistency of the estimates are established. The conditions employed involve the analogues of the Hardy - Littlewood maximal function. It is shown that the results are valid in particular for the entropy estimation of any nondegenerate Gaussian vector.;math.ST
1801.02051;Stochastic B-series and order conditions for exponential integrators;We discuss stochastic differential equations with a stiff linear part and their approximation by stochastic exponential integrators. Representing the exact and approximate solutions using B-series and rooted trees, we derive the order conditions for stochastic exponential integrators. The resulting general order theory covers both It\^{o} and Stratonovich integration.;math.NA
1801.02061;Optimal Error Correcting Delivery Scheme for an Optimal Coded Caching Scheme with Small Buffers;Optimal delivery scheme for coded caching problems with small buffer sizes and the number of users no less than the amount of files in the server was proposed by Chen, Fan and Letaief ["Fundamental limits of caching: improved bounds for users with small buffers," (IET Communications), 2016]. This scheme is referred to as the CFL scheme. In this paper, the link between the server and the users is assumed to be error prone only during the delivery phase. Closed form expressions for average rate and peak rate of error correcting delivery scheme for CFL prefetching scheme is obtained. An optimal error correcting delivery scheme for caching problems employing CFL prefetching is proposed.;cs.IT
1801.02066;Resource Optimization with Flexible Numerology and Frame Structure for Heterogeneous Services;We explore the potential of optimizing resource allocation with flexible numerology in frequency domain and variable frame structure in time domain, in presence of services with different types of requirements. We analyze the computational complexity and propose a scalable optimization algorithm based on searching in both the primal space and dual space that are complementary to each other. Numerical results show significant advantages of adopting flexibility in both time and frequency domains for capacity enhancement and meeting the requirements of mission critical services.;cs.IT
1801.02070;Error analysis of one-stage explicit extended RKN integrators for semilinear wave equations;In this paper, we present an error analysis of one-stage explicit extended Runge--Kutta--Nystr\"{o}m integrators for semilinear wave equations. These equations are analysed by using spatial semidiscretizations with periodic boundary conditions in one space dimension. Optimal second-order convergence is proved without requiring Lipschitz continuous and higher regularity of the exact solution. Moreover, the error analysis is not restricted to the spectral semidiscretization in space.;math.NA
1801.02071;$n$-Ary generalized Lie-type color algebras admitting a quasi-multiplicative basis;The class of generalized Lie-type color algebras contains the ones of generalized Lie-type algebras, of $n$-Lie algebras and superalgebras, commutative Leibniz $n$-ary algebras and superalgebras, among others. We focus on the class of generalized Lie-type color algebras $\frak L$ admitting a quasi-multiplicative basis, with restrictions neither on the dimensions nor on the base field $\mathbb F$ and study its structure. If we write $\frak L = \mathbb V \oplus \mathbb W$ with $\mathbb V$ and $0 \neq \mathbb W$ linear subspaces, we say that a basis of homogeneous elements $\mathfrak{B} = \{e_i\}_{i \in I}$ of $\mathbb W$ is quasi-multiplicative if given $0 &lt, k &lt, n,$ for $i_1,\dots,i_k \in I$ and $\sigma \in \mathbb S_n$ satisfies $\langle e_{i_1}, \dots, e_{i_k}, \mathbb V, \dots, \mathbb V \rangle_{\sigma} \subset \mathbb{F}e_{j_{\sigma}}$ for some $j_{\sigma} \in I,$ the product of elements of the basis $\langle e_{i_1}, \dots, e_{i_n} \rangle$ belongs to $\mathbb{F}e_j$ for some $j \in I$ or to $\mathbb V$, and a similar condition is verified for the product $\langle \mathbb V, \dots,\mathbb V \rangle$. We state that if $\frak L$ admits a quasi-multiplicative basis then it decomposes as $\mathfrak{L} ={\mathcal U} \oplus (\sum\limits {\frak J}_{k})$ with any ${\frak J}_k$ a well described color gLt-ideal of $\frak L$ admitting also a quasi-multiplicative basis, and ${\mathcal U}$ a linear subspace of $\mathbb V$. <br />Also the minimality of $\frak L$ is characterized in terms of the connections and it is shown that the above direct sum is by means of the family of its minimal color gLt-ideals, admitting each one a $\mu$-quasi-multiplicative basis inherited by the one of $\frak L$.;math.RA
1801.02074;Probabilistic Control for Uncertain Systems;In this paper a new framework has been applied to the design of controllers which encompasses nonlinearity, hysteresis and arbitrary density functions of forward models and inverse controllers. Using mixture density networks, the probabilistic models of both the forward and inverse dynamics are estimated such that they are dependent on the state and the control input. The optimal control strategy is then derived which minimizes uncertainty of the closed loop system. In the absence of reliable plant models, the proposed control algorithm incorporates uncertainties in model parameters, observations, and latent processes. The local stability of the closed loop system has been established. The efficacy of the control algorithm is demonstrated on two nonlinear stochastic control examples with additive and multiplicative noise.;math.OC
1801.02083;Delta-problems for the generalized Euler-Darboux equation;Degenerate hyperbolic equations are dealing with many important issues for applied nature. While a variety of degenerate equations and boundary conditions, successfully matched to these differential equation, most in the characteristic coordinates reduced to Euler-Darboux one. Some boundary value problems, in particular Cauchy problem, for the specified equation demanded the introduction of special classes in which formulae are simple and can be used to meet the new challenges, including Delta-problems in squares that contain singularity line for equation coefficients with data on adjacent or parallel sides of the square. In this short communication the generalized Euler-Darboux equation with negative parameters in the rectangular region is considered.;math.AP
1801.02088;Mobi algebra as an abstraction to the unit interval and its comparison to rings;We begin by introducing an algebraic structure with three constants and one ternary operation to which we call mobi algebra. This structure has been designed to capture the most relevant properties of the unit interval that are needed in the study of geodesic paths. Another algebraic structure, called involutive medial monoid (IMM), can be derived from a mobi algebra. We prove several results on the interplay between mobi algebras, IMM algebras and unitary rings. It turns out that every unitary ring with one half uniquely determines and is uniquely determined by a mobi algebra with one double. This paper is the second of a planned series of papers dedicated to the study of geodesic paths from an algebraic point of view.;math.RA
1801.02089;The tropical analogue of the Helton-Nie conjecture is true;Helton and Nie conjectured that every convex semialgebraic set over the field of real numbers can be written as the projection of a spectrahedron. Recently, Scheiderer disproved this conjecture. We show, however, that the following result, which may be thought of as a tropical analogue of this conjecture, is true: over a real closed nonarchimedean field of Puiseux series, the convex semialgebraic sets and the projections of spectrahedra have precisely the same images by the nonarchimedean valuation. The proof relies on game theory methods.;math.AG
1801.02090;Testing equality in distribution of random convex compact sets via theory of N-distances and its application to assessing similarity of general random sets;This paper concerns a method of testing equality of distribution of random convex compact sets and the way how to use the test to distinguish between two realisations of general random sets. The family of metrics on the space of distributions of random convex compact sets is constructed using the theory of N-distances and characteristic functions of random convex compact sets. Further, the approximation of the metrics through its finite dimensional counterparts is proposed, which lead to a new statistical test for testing equality in distribution of two random convex compact sets. Then, it is described how to approximate a realisation of a general random set by a union of convex compact sets, and it is shown how to determine whether two realisations of general random sets come from the same process using the constructed test. The procedure is justified by an extensive simulation study.;math.ST
1801.02092;Imperfect bifurcation for the quasi-geostrophic shallow-water equations;We study analytical and numerical aspects of the bifurcation diagram of simply-connected rotating vortex patch equilibria for the quasi-geostrophic shallow-water (QGSW) equations. The QGSW equations are a generalisation of the Euler equations and contain an additional parameter, the Rossby deformation length $\EE^{-1}$, which enters in the relation between streamfunction and (potential) vorticity. The Euler equations are recovered in the limit $\EE\to 0$. We prove, close to circular (Rankine) vortices, the persistence of the bifurcation diagram for arbitrary Rossby deformation length. However we show that the two-fold branch, corresponding to Kirchhoff ellipses for the Euler equations, is never connected even for small values $\EE$, and indeed is split into a countable set of disjoint connected branches. Accurate numerical calculations of the global structure of the bifurcation diagram and of the limiting equilibrium states are also presented to complement the mathematical analysis.;math.AP
1801.02097;Operator-norm convergence estimates for elliptic homogenisation problems on periodic singular structures;For a an arbitrary periodic Borel measure $\mu$, we prove order $O(\varepsilon)$ operator-norm resolvent estimates for the solutions to scalar elliptic problems in $L^2({\mathbb R}^d, d\mu^\varepsilon)$ with $\varepsilon$-periodic coefficients, $\varepsilon&gt,0.$ Here $\mu^\varepsilon$ is the measure obtained by $\varepsilon$-scaling of $\mu.$ Our analysis includes both the case of a measure absolutely continuous with respect to the standard Lebesgue measure and the case of "singular" periodic structures (or "multistructures"), when $\mu$ is supported by lower-dimensional manifolds.;math.AP
1801.02102;On the interplay among maximum principles, compact support principles and Keller-Osserman conditions on manifolds;This paper is about the influence of Geometry on the qualitative behaviour of solutions of quasilinear PDEs on Riemannian manifolds. Motivated by examples arising, among others, from the theory of submanifolds, in particular by the study of entire graphs with prescribed mean curvature, we consider classes of coercive differential inequalities of the form $$ \mathrm{div}\left( \frac{\varphi(|\nabla u|)}{|\nabla u|} \nabla u\right) \ge b(x)f(u) l(|\nabla u|) \qquad \text{(respectively, $\le$ or $=$)} $$ on domains of a manifold $M$, for suitable $\varphi,b,f,l$, with emphasis on mean curvature type operators. We investigate the validity of strong maximum principles, compact support principles and Liouville type theorems, in particular, the goal is to identify sharp thresholds, involving curvatures or volume growth of geodesic balls in $M$, to guarantee the above properties under appropriate Keller-Osserman type conditions, and to discuss the geometric reasons behind the existence of such thresholds. The paper also aims to give a unified view of recent results in the literature. The bridge with Geometry is realized by studying the validity of weak and strong maximum principles at infinity, in the spirit of Omori-Yau's Hessian and Laplacian principles and subsequent improvements.;math.AP
1801.02103;Continuous generalization of Clarkson-McCarthy inequalities;Let $G$ be a compact abelian group, let $\mu$ be the corresponding Haar measure, and let $\hat G$ be the Pontryagin dual of $G$. Further, let $C_p$ denote the Schatten class of operators on some separable infinite dimensional Hilbert space, and let $L^p(G,C_p)$ denote the corresponding Bochner space. If $G\ni\theta\mapsto A_\theta$ is the mapping belonging to $L^p(G,C_p)$ then, $$\sum_{k\in\hat G}\left\|\int_G\overline{k(\theta)}A_\theta\,\mathrm{d}\theta\right\|_p^p\le\int_G\|A_\theta\|_p^p\,\mathrm{d}\theta,\qquad p\ge2$$ $$\sum_{k\in\hat G}\left\|\int_G\overline{k(\theta)}A_\theta\,\mathrm{d}\theta\right\|_p^p\le\left(\int_G\|A_\theta\|_p^q\,\mathrm{d}\theta\right)^{p/q},\qquad p\ge2.$$ $$\sum_{k\in\hat G}\left\|\int_G\overline{k(\theta)}A_\theta\,\mathrm{d}\theta\right\|_p^q\le\left(\int_G\|A_\theta\|_p^p\,\mathrm{d}\theta\right)^{q/p},\qquad p\le2.$$ <br />If $G$ is a finite group, the previous comprises several earlier obtained generalizations of Clarkson-McCarthy inequalities (e.g. $G=\mathbf{Z}_n$ or $G=\mathbf{Z}_2^n$), as well as the original inequalities, for $G=\mathbf{Z}_2$. <br />Other related inequalities are also obtained.;math.FA
1801.02105;Twisted conjugacy and quasi-isometric rigidity of irreducible lattices in semisimple Lie groups;Let $G$ be a non-compact semisimple Lie group with finite centre and finitely many components. We show that any finitely generated group $\Gamma$ which is quasi-isometric to an irreducible lattice in $G$ has the $R_\infty$-property, namely, that there are infinitely $\phi$-twisted conjugacy classes for every automorphism $\phi$ of $\Gamma$. Also, we show that any lattice in $G$ has the $R_\infty$-property, extending our earlier result for irreducible lattices.;math.GR
1801.02110;Equivariant dendroidal Segal spaces and $G$-$\infty$-operads;We introduce the analogues of the notions of complete Segal space and of Segal category in the context of equivariant operads with norm maps, and build model categories with these as the fibrant objects. We then show that these model categories are Quillen equivalent to each other and to the model category for $G$-$\infty$-operads built in a previous paper. Moreover, we establish variants of these results for the Blumberg-Hill indexing systems. In an appendix, we discuss Reedy categories in the equivariant context.;math.AT
1801.02111;Convergence of the empirical spectral distribution of Gaussian matrix-valued processes;For a given normalized Gaussian symmetric matrix-valued process $Y^{(n)}$, we consider the process of its eigenvalues $\{(\lambda_{1}^{(n)}(t),\dots, \lambda_{n}^{(n)}(t)), t\ge 0\}$ as well as its corresponding process of empirical spectral measures $\mu^{(n)}=(\mu_{t}^{(n)}, t\geq0)$. Under some mild conditions on the covariance function associated to $Y^{(n)}$, we prove that the process $\mu^{(n)}$ converges in probability to a deterministic limit $\mu$, in the topology of uniform convergence over compact sets. We show that the process $\mu$ is characterized by its Cauchy transform, which is a rescaling of the solution of a Burgers' equation. Our results extend those of Rogers and Shi for the free Brownian motion and Pardo et al. for the non-commutative fractional Brownian motion when $H&gt,1/2$ whose arguments use strongly the non-collision of the eigenvalues. Our methodology does not require the latter property and in particular explains the remaining case of the non-commutative fractional Brownian motion for $H&lt, 1/2$ which, up to our knowledge, was unknown.;math.PR

1801.02114;Measure Upper Bounds of Nodal Sets of Robin Eigenfunctions;In this paper, we obtain the upper bounds for the Hausdorff measures of nodal sets of eigenfunctions with the Robin boundary conditions, i.e., <br />\begin{equation*} {\left\{\begin{array}{l} <br />\triangle u+\lambda u=0,\quad in\quad \Omega,\\ u_{\nu}+\mu u=0,\quad on\quad\partial\Omega, \end{array} \right.} \end{equation*} where the domain $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$, $u_{\nu}$ means the derivative of $u$ along the outer normal direction of $\partial\Omega$. We show that, if $\Omega$ is bounded and analytic, and the corresponding eigenvalue $\lambda$ is large enough,then the measure upper bounds for the nodal sets of eigenfunctions are $C\sqrt{\lambda}$, where $C$ is a positive constant depending only on $n$ and $\Omega$ but not on $\mu$ We also show that, if $\partial\Omega$ is $C^{\infty}$ smooth and $\partial\Omega\setminus\Gamma$ is piecewise analytic, where $\Gamma\subseteq\partial\Omega$ is a union of some $n-2$ dimensional submanifolds of $\partial\Omega$, $\mu&gt,0$, and $\lambda$ is large enough, then the corresponding measure upper bounds for the nodal sets of $u$ are $C(\sqrt{\lambda}+\mu^{\alpha}+\mu^{-c\alpha})$ for some positive number $\alpha$, where $c$ is a positive constant depending only on $n$, and $C$ is a positive constant depending on $n$, $\Omega$, $\Gamma$ and $\alpha$.;math.AP
1801.02126;Relative Equilibria in curved restricted 4-body problems;We consider the curved 4-body problems on spheres and hyperbolic spheres. After obtaining a criterion for the existence of quadrilateral configu- rations on the equator of the sphere, we study two restricted 4-body problems, one in which two masses are negligible, and another in which only one mass is negligible. In the former we prove the evidence square-like relative equilibria, whereas in the latter we discuss the existence of kite-shaped relative equilibria.;math.CA
1801.02130;Dynamic Traffic Assignment using the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram: A Review of Vehicular and Pedestrian Flow Models;Traditional DTA models of large cities suffer from prohibitive computation times and calibration/validation can become major challenges faced by practitioners. The empirical evidence in 2008 in support of the existence of a Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) on urban networks led to the formulation of discrete-space models, where the city is divided into a collection of reservoirs. Prior to 2008, a large body of DTA models based on pedestrian flow models had been formulated in continuum space as 2-dimensional conservation laws where the speed-density relationship can now be interpreted as the MFD. Perhaps surprisingly, we found that this continuum-space literature has been mostly unaware of MFD theory, and no attempts exist to verify the assumptions of MFD theory. This has the potential to create significant inconsistencies, and research is needed to analyze their extent and ways to resolve them. We also find that further research is needed to (i) incorporate departure time choice, (ii) improve existing numerical methods, possibly extending recent advances on the one-dimensional kinematic wave (LWR) model, (iii) study the properties of system optimum solutions, (iv) examine the real-time applicability of current continuum-space models compared to traditional DTA methods, and (v) formulate anisotropic models for the interaction of intersecting flows.;math.AP
1801.02142;Tiltan;We prove that tiltan is consistent with the negation of Galvin's property. On the other hand, superclub implies Galvin's property. We also show that tiltan is consistent with a large value of the splitting number at kappa, where kappa is supercompact.;math.LO
1801.02145;Depth-graded motivic Lie algebra;Consider the neutral Tannakian category mixed Tate motives over Z, in this paper we suggest a way to understand the structure of depth-graded motivic Lie subalgebra generated by the depth one part. We will show that from an isomorphism conjecture proposed by K. Tasaka we can deduce the F. Brown matrix conjecture and the non-degenerated conjecture about depth-graded motivic Lie subalgebra generated by the depth one part.;math.NT
1801.02146;Polyharmonic weak Maass forms of higher depth for SL_2(Z);The space of polyharmonic Maass forms was introduced by Lagarias-Rhoades, recently. They constructed its basis from the Taylor coefficients of the real analytic Eisenstein series. In this paper, we introduce polyharmonic weak Maass forms, that is, we relax the moderate growth condition at cusp, and we construct a basis as a generalization of Lagarias-Rhoades' works. As a corollary, we can obtain a preimage of an arbitrary polyharmonic weak Maass form under the xi-operator.;math.NT
1801.02152;Characterization of matrices $B$ such that $(I,B,B^2)$ generates a digital net with $t$-value zero;We study $3$-dimensional digital nets over $\mathbb{F}_2$ generated by matrices $(I,B,B^2)$ where $I$ is the identity matrix and $B$ is a square matrix. We give a characterization of $B$ for which the $t$-value of the digital net is $0$. As a corollary, we prove that such $B$ satisfies $B^3=I$.;math.NT
1801.02157;Concentration of the spectral norm of Erd&#x151,s-R&#xe9,nyi random graphs;We present results on the concentration properties of the spectral norm $\|A_p\|$ of the adjacency matrix $A_p$ of an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$. First we consider the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph process and prove that $\|A_p\|$ is uniformly concentrated over the range $p\in [C\log n/n,1]$. The analysis is based on delocalization arguments, uniform laws of large numbers, together with the entropy method to prove concentration inequalities. As an application of our techniques we prove sharp sub-Gaussian moment inequalities for $\|A_p\|$ for all $p\in [c\log^3n/n,1]$ that improve the general bounds of Alon, Krivelevich, and Vu (2001) and some of the more recent results of Erd\H{o}s et al. (2013). Both results are consistent with the asymptotic result of F\"uredi and Koml\'os (1981) that holds for fixed $p$ as $n\to \infty$.;math.PR
1801.02158;Blind Demixing for Low-Latency Communication;In the next generation wireless networks, lowlatency communication is critical to support emerging diversified applications, e.g., Tactile Internet and Virtual Reality. In this paper, a novel blind demixing approach is developed to reduce the channel signaling overhead, thereby supporting low-latency communication. Specifically, we develop a low-rank approach to recover the original information only based on a single observed vector without any channel estimation. Unfortunately, this problem turns out to be a highly intractable non-convex optimization problem due to the multiple non-convex rankone constraints. To address the unique challenges, the quotient manifold geometry of product of complex asymmetric rankone matrices is exploited by equivalently reformulating original complex asymmetric matrices to the Hermitian positive semidefinite matrices. We further generalize the geometric concepts of the complex product manifolds via element-wise extension of the geometric concepts of the individual manifolds. A scalable Riemannian trust-region algorithm is then developed to solve the blind demixing problem efficiently with fast convergence rates and low iteration cost. Numerical results will demonstrate the algorithmic advantages and admirable performance of the proposed algorithm compared with the state-of-art methods.;cs.IT
1801.02159;Supergrassmannians as Homogeneous Superspaces;A homogeneous space is a manifold on which a Lie group acts transitively. Super generalization of this concept is also studied in [2] and [4]. In this paper we explicitly show that super Lie group GL(m|n) acts transitively on supergrassmannian G_{k|l}(m|n). In this regard, by using functor of point approach, this action is constructed by gluing local actions.;math.DG
1801.02161;Metastability in Stochastic Replicator Dynamics;We consider a novel model of stochastic replicator dynamics for potential games that converts to a Langevin equation on a sphere after a change of variables. This is distinct from the models studied earlier. In particular, it is ill-posed due to non-uniqueness of solutions, but is amenable to a natural selection principle that picks a unique solution. The model allows us to make specific statements regarding metastable states such as small noise asymptotics for mean exit times from their domain of attraction, and quasi-stationary measures. We illustrate the general results by specializing them to replicator dynamics on graphs and demonstrate that the numerical experiments support theoretical predictions.;math.PR
1801.02164;Spectrality of product domains and Fuglede&#x27,s conjecture for convex polytopes;A set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is said to be spectral if the space $L^2(\Omega)$ has an orthogonal basis of exponential functions. It is well-known that in many respects, spectral sets "behave like" sets which can tile the space by translations. This suggests a conjecture that a product set $\Omega = A \times B$ is spectral if and only if the factors $A$ and $B$ are both spectral sets. We recently proved this in the case when $A$ is an interval in dimension one. The main result of the present paper is that the conjecture is true also when $A$ is a convex polygon in two dimensions. We discuss this result in connection with the conjecture that a convex polytope $\Omega$ is spectral if and only if it can tile by translations.;math.CA
1801.02172;Market-based Control of Air-Conditioning Loads with Switching Constraints for Providing Ancillary Services;Air-conditioning loads (ACLs) are among the most promising demand side resources for their thermal storage capacity and fast response potential. This paper adopts the principle of market-based control (MBC) for the ACLs to participate in the ancillary services. The MBC method is suitable for the control of distributed ACLs because it can satisfy diversified requirements, reduce the communication bandwidth and protect users' privacy. The modified bidding and clearing strategies proposed in this paper makes it possible to adjust the switching frequency and strictly satisfy the lockout time constraint for mechanical wear reduction and device protection, without increasing the communication traffic and computational cost of the control center. The performance of the ACL cluster in two typical ancillary services is studied to demonstrate the effect of the proposed method. The case studies also investigate how the control parameters affect the response performance, comfort level and switching frequency.;math.OC
1801.02173;Weighted estimates for the Calder&#xf3,n commutator;In this paper, the authors establish some weighted estimates for the Calder\'on commutator defined by \begin{eqnarray*} &amp,&amp,\mathcal{C}_{m+1,\,A}(a_1,\dots,a_{m},f)(x) &amp,&amp,\quad={\rm p.\,v.}\,\int_{\mathbb{R}}\frac{P_2(A,\,x,\,y)\prod_{j=1}^m(A_j(x)-A_j(y))}{(x-y)^{m+2}}f(y){\rm d}y, \end{eqnarray*} with $P_2(A,\,x,\,y)=A(x)-A(y)-A'(y)(x-y)$. Dominating this operator by multi(sub)linear sparse operators, the authors establish the weighted bounds from $L^{p_1}(\mathbb{R},w_1)$ $\times\dots\times L^{p_m}(\mathbb{R},w_m)$ to $L^{p}(\mathbb{R},\nu_{\vec{w}})$, with $p_1,\dots,p_m \in (1,\,\infty)$, $1/p=1/p_1+\dots+1/p_m$, and $\vec{w}=(w_1,\,\dots,\,w_m)\in A_{\vec{P}}(\mathbb{R}^{m+1})$. The authors also obtain the weighted weak type endpoint estimates for this operator;math.CA
1801.02177;Accuracy of noisy Spike-Train Reconstruction: a Singularity Theory point of view;This is a survey paper discussing one specific (and classical) system of algebraic equations - the so called "Prony system". We provide a short overview of its unusually wide connections with many different fields of Mathematics, stressing the role of Singularity Theory. We reformulate Prony System as the problem of reconstruction of "Spike-train" signals of the form $F(x)=\sum_{j=1}^d a_j\delta(x-x_j)$ from the noisy moment measurements. We provide an overview of some recent results of [1-3, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 5] on the "geometry of the error amplification" in the reconstruction process, in situations where the nodes $x_j$ near-collide. Some algebraic-geometric structures, underlying the error amplification, are described (Prony, Vieta, and Hankel mappings, Prony varieties), as well as their connection with Vandermonde mappings and varieties. Our main goal is to present some promising fields of possible applications of Singulary Theory.;math.NA
1801.02179;Effective strong convergence of the proximal point algorithm in CAT(0) spaces;We apply methods of proof mining to obtain uniform quantitative bounds on the strong convergence of the proximal point algorithm for finding minimizers of convex, lower semicontinuous proper functions in CAT(0) spaces. Thus, for uniformly convex functions we compute rates of convergence, while, for totally bounded CAT(0) spaces we apply methods introduced by Kohlenbach, the first author and Nicolae to compute rates of metastability.;math.OC
1801.02180;Contact (+1)-surgeries along Legendrian Two-component Links;In this paper, we study contact surgeries along Legendrian links in the standard contact 3-sphere. On one hand, we use algebraic methods to prove the vanishing of the contact Ozsv\'{a}th-Szab\'{o} invariant for contact $(+1)$-surgery along certain Legendrian two-component links. The main tool is a link surgery formula for Heegaard Floer homology developed by Manolescu and Ozsv\'{a}th. On the other hand, we use contact-geometric argument to show the overtwistedness of the contact 3-manifolds obtained by contact $(+1)$-surgeries along Legendrian two-component links whose two components are linked in some special configurations.;math.GT
1801.02182;On Laporta&#x27,s 4-loop sunrise formulae;We prove Laporta's conjecture\begin{align*}&amp,\int_0^\infty\frac{\mathrm d\, x_1}{x_1}\int_0^\infty\frac{\mathrm d\, x_2}{x_2}\int_0^\infty\frac{\mathrm d\, x_3}{x_3}\int_0^\infty\frac{\mathrm d\, x_4}{x_4}\frac{1}{\left(1+\sum^4_{k=1}x_k\right)\left(1+\sum^4_{k=1}\frac{1}{x_{k}} \right)-1}\\={}&amp,\frac43 \int_{0}^\pi\mathrm d\, \phi_1 \int_{0}^\pi\mathrm d\, \phi_2\int_{0}^\pi\mathrm d\, \phi_3 \int_{0}^\pi\mathrm d\, \phi_4\frac{1}{4-\sum_{k=1}^4\cos \phi_k}, \end{align*} which relates the 4-loop sunrise diagram in 2-dimensional quantum field theory to Watson's integral for 4-dimensional hypercubic lattice. We also establish several related integral identities proposed by Laporta, including a reduction of the 4-loop sunrise diagram to special values of Euler's gamma function and generalized hypergeometric series:\begin{align*} \frac{4 \pi ^{5/2}}{\sqrt{3}}\left\{ \frac{\sqrt{3} }{2^6 }\left[\frac{\Gamma \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)}{\sqrt{\pi}}\right]^9\, _4F_3\left(\left. \begin{array}{c}\frac{1}{6},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2}\\[4pt]\frac{2}{3},\frac{5}{6},\frac{5}{6}\end{array} \right|1\right)-\frac{2^{4}}{3}\left[\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{\Gamma \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)}\right]^9\, _4F_3\left(\left. \begin{array}{c}\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{3},\frac{2}{3},\frac{5}{6}\\[4pt]\frac{7}{6},\frac{7}{6},\frac{4}{3}\end{array} \right|1\right) \right\}. \end{align*};math.CA
1801.02183;Varadhan Asymptotics for the Heat Kernel on Finite Graphs;Let $G$ be a simple, finite graph and let $p_t(x,y)$ denote the heat kernel on $G$. The purpose of this short note is to show that for $t \rightarrow 0^+$ $$ p_t(x,y) = \# \left\{\mbox{paths of length}~d(x,y)~\mbox{between}~x~\mbox{and}~y\right\} \frac{t^{d(x,y)}}{d(x,y)!} + \mathcal{O}(t^{d(x,y)+1}),$$ where $d(x,y)$ is the usual Graph distance. This is the discrete analogue of the classical Varadhan asymptotic for the heat kernel on manifolds and refines a result of Keller, Lenz, M\"unch, Schmidt and Telcs. The asymptotic behavior encapsulates additional geometric information: if the Graph is bipartite, then the next term in the expansion is negative.;math.AP
1801.02186;Clique-coloring of $K_{3,3}$-minor free graphs;A clique-coloring of a given graph $G$ is a coloring of the vertices of $G$ such that no maximal clique of size at least two is monocolored. The clique-chromatic number of $G$ is the least number of colors for which $G$ admits a clique-coloring. It has been proved that every planar graph is $3$-clique colorable and every claw-free planar graph, different from an odd cycle, is $2$-clique colorable. In this paper, we generalize these results to $K_{3,3}$-minor free ($K_{3,3}$-subdivision free) graphs.;math.CO
1801.02194;Private Computation of Systematically Encoded Data with Colluding Servers;Private Computation (PC), recently introduced by Sun and Jafar, is a generalization of Private Information Retrieval (PIR) in which a user wishes to privately compute an arbitrary function of data stored across several servers. We construct a PC scheme which accounts for server collusion, coded data, and non-linear functions. For data replicated over several possibly colluding servers, our scheme computes arbitrary functions of the data with rate equal to the asymptotic capacity of PIR for this setup. For systematically encoded data stored over colluding servers, we privately compute arbitrary functions of the columns of the data matrix and calculate the rate explicitly for polynomial functions. The scheme is a generalization of previously studied star-product PIR schemes.;cs.IT
1801.02207;On the role of curvature in the elastic energy of non-Euclidean thin bodies;We prove a relation between the scaling $h^\beta$ of the elastic energies of shrinking non-Euclidean bodies $S_h$ of thickness $h\to 0$, and the curvature along their mid-surface $S$. This extends and generalizes similar results for plates [BLS16, LRR] to any dimension and co-dimension. In particular, it proves that the natural scaling for non-Euclidean rods with smooth metric is $h^4$, as claimed in [AAE+12] using a formal asymptotic expansion. The proof involves calculating the $\Gamma$-limit for the elastic energies of small balls $B_h(p)$, scaled by $h^4$, and showing that the limit infimum energy is given by a square of a norm of the curvature at a point $p$. This $\Gamma$-limit proves asymptotics calculated in [AKM+16].;math.AP
1801.02208;Johnson pseudo-contractibility and pseudo-amenability of $ &#x3b8,$-Lau product of Banach algebras;Given Banach algebras $ A $ and $ B $ with $ \theta\in\Delta(B) $. We shall study the Johnson pseudo-contractibility and pseudo-amenability of $ \theta $-Lau product $ A\times_{\theta} B $. We show that if $ A\times_{\theta} B $ is Johnson pseudo-contractible, then $ A $ is Johnson pseudo-contractible and has a bounded approximate identity and $ B $ is Johnson pseudo-contractible. In some particular cases complete characterization of Johnson pseudo-contractibility of $ A\times_{\theta} B $ are given. Also, we show that pseudo-amenability of $ A\times_{\theta} B $ implies approximate amenability of $ A $ and pseudo-amenability of $ B $.;math.FA
1801.02212;The fifth moment of Hecke L-functions in the weight aspect;We prove an upper bound for the fifth moment of Hecke L-functions associated to holomorphic Hecke cusp forms of full level and weight k in a dyadic interval K &lt, k &lt, 2K, as K tends to infinity. The bound is sharp on Selberg's eigenvalue conjecture.;math.NT
1801.02213;On the divisibility of some truncated hypergeometric series;Let $p$ be an odd prime and $r\geq 1$. Suppose that $\alpha$ is a $p$-adic integer with $\alpha\equiv2a\pmod p$ for some $1\leq a&lt,(p+r)/(2r+1)$. We confirm a conjecture of Sun and prove that $${}_{2r+1}F_{2r}\bigg[\begin{matrix}\alpha&amp,\alpha&amp,\ldots&amp,\alpha\\ &amp,1&amp,\ldots&amp,1\end{matrix}\bigg|\,1\bigg]_{p-1}\equiv0\pmod{p^2},$$ where the truncated hypergeometric series $$ {}_{q+1}F_{q}\bigg[\begin{matrix}x_0&amp,x_1&amp,\ldots&amp,x_{q}\\ &amp,y_1&amp,\ldots&amp,y_q\end{matrix}\bigg|\,z\bigg]_{n}:=\sum_{k=0}^n\frac{(x_0)_k(x_1)_k\cdots(x_q)_k}{(y_1)_k\cdot (y_q)_k}\cdot\frac{z^k}{k!}. $$;math.NT
1801.02214;Linear algebra properties of dissipative Hamiltonian descriptor systems;A wide class of matrix pencils connected with dissipative Hamiltonian descriptor systems is investigated. In particular, the following properties are shown: all eigenvalues are in the closed left half plane, the nonzero finite eigenvalues on the imaginary axis are semisimple, the index is at most two, and there are restrictions for the possible left and right minimal indices. For the case that the eigenvalue zero is not semisimple, a structure-preserving method is presented that perturbs the given system into a Lyapunov stable system.;math.NA
1801.02218;Critical Multipliers in Semidefinite Programming;It was proved in [14] that the existence of a noncritical multiplier for a (smooth) nonlinear programming problem is equivalent to an error bound condition for the Karush-Kuhn-Thcker (KKT) system without any assumptions. This paper investigates whether this result still holds true for a (smooth) nonlinear semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. We first introduce the notion of critical and noncritical multipliers for a SDP problem and obtain their complete characterizations in terms of the problem data. We prove for the SDP problem, the noncriticality property can be derived from the error bound condition for the KKT system without any assumptions, and this fact is revealed by some simple examples. Besides we give an appropriate second-order sufficient optimality condition characterizing noncriticality explicitly. We propose a set of assumptions from which the error bound condition for the KKT system can be derived from the noncriticality property. Finally we establish a new error bound for x-part, which is expressed by both perturbation and the multiplier estimation.;math.OC
1801.02228;On cubic Thue equations and the common index divisors of cyclic cubic fields;In this paper, we investigate the common index divisors of cyclic cubic fields. Let $a,b,c,d$ and $k$ are integers, we then solve the following Thue cubic equations:: \[ax^3+bx^2y+cxy^2+dy^3= k\ \] when $a,bc+d$ are odd and $3$ doesn't divide $v_2(k)$.;math.NT
1801.02229;Packet Speed and Cost in Mobile Wireless Delay-Tolerant Networks;A mobile wireless delay-tolerant network (DTN) model is proposed and analyzed, in which infinitely many nodes are initially placed on R^2 according to a uniform Poisson point process (PPP) and subsequently travel, independently of each other, along trajectories comprised of line segments, changing travel direction at time instances that form a Poisson process, each time selecting a new travel direction from an arbitrary distribution, all nodes maintain constant speed. A single information packet is traveling towards a given direction using both wireless transmissions and sojourns on node buffers, according to a member of a broad class of possible routing rules. For this model, we compute the long-term averages of the speed with which the packet travels towards its destination and the rate with which the wireless transmission cost accumulates. Because of the complexity of the problem, we employ two intuitive, simplifying approximations, simulations verify that the approximation error is typically small. Our results quantify the fundamental trade-off that exists in mobile wireless DTNs between the packet speed and the packet delivery cost. The framework developed here is both general and versatile, and can be used as a starting point for further investigation.;cs.IT
1801.02231;Common Divisors of Values Polynomials and common factors of indices in a Number Field;Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a number field of degree $n$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. Let $\widehat{\mathbb{A}}$ be the set of integers of $\mathbb{K}$ which are primitive over $\mathbb{Q}$ and $I(\mathbb{K})$ be its index. Gunji and McQuillan defined the following integer $i(\mathbb{K})=\underset{\theta\in \widehat{\mathbb{A}}}{\text{lcm}}\,i(\theta)$, where $i(\theta)=\underset{x\in \mathbb{Z}}{\text{gcd}}\,F_\theta(x)$ and $F_\theta(x)$ is the characteristic polynomial of $\theta$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. We prove that if $p$ is a prime number less than or equal to $n$ then there exists a number field $\mathbb{K}$ of degree $n$ for which $p$ divides $i(\mathbb{K})$. We compute $i(\mathbb{K})$ for cubic fields. Also we determine $I(\mathbb{K})$ and $i(\mathbb{K})$ for families of simplest number fields of degree less than $7$. We give also answers to questions one and two in \cite{Kihel}. Furthermore, we give a counter example to Theorem 11 in \cite{Kihel} and we discuss their conjecture.;math.NT
1801.02232;Index, Prime Ideal Factorization in simplest Quartic Fields and counting their discriminants;We consider the simplest quartic number fields $\mathbb{K}_m$ defined by the irreducible quartic polynomials $$x^4-mx^3-6x^2+mx+1,$$ where $m$ runs over the positive rational integers such that the odd part of $m^2+16$ is squarefree. In this paper, we study the common index divisor $I(\mathbb K_m)$ and determine explicitly the prime ideal decomposition for any prime number in any simplest quartic number fields $\mathbb{K}_m$. On the other hand, we establish an asymptotic formula for the number of simplest quartic fields with discriminant $\leq x$ and given index.;math.NT
1801.02244;Symmetric Khovanov--Rozansky link homologies;We provide a finite dimensional categorification of the symmetric evaluation of $\mathfrak{sl}_N$-webs using foam technology. As an output we obtain a symmetric link homology theory categorifying the link invariant associated to symmetric powers of the standard representation of $\mathfrak{sl}_N$. In addition, the construction is actually made in an equivariant setting. We prove also that there is a spectral sequence from the Khovanov-Rozansky triply graded link homology to the symmetric one and provide along the way a foam interpretation of Soergel bimodules.;math.GT
1801.02245;Essential dimension in mixed characteristic;Suppose $G$ is a finite group and $p$ is either a prime number or $0$. For $p$ positive, we say that $G$ is weakly tame at $p$ if $G$ has no non-trivial normal $p$-subgroups. By convention we say that every finite group is weakly tame at $0$. Now suppose that $G$ is a finite group which is weakly tame at the residue characteristic of a discrete valuation ring $R$. Our main result shows that the essential dimension of $G$ over the fraction field $K$ of $R$ is at least as large as the essential dimension of $G$ over the residue field $k$. We also prove a more general statement of this type for a class of \'etale gerbes over $R$. <br />As a corollary, we show that, if $G$ is weakly tame at $p$ and $k$ is any field of characteristic $p &gt,0$ containing the algebraic closure of $\mathbb{F}_p$, then the essential dimension of $G$ over $k$ is less than or equal to the essential dimension of $G$ over any characteristic $0$ field. A conjecture of A. Ledet asserts that the essential dimension, $\mathrm{ed}_k(\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z})$, of the cyclic group of order $p^n$ over a field $k$ is equal to $n$ whenever $k$ is a field of characteristic $p$. We show that this conjecture implies that $\mathrm{ed}_{\mathbb{C}}(G) \geq n$ for any finite group $G$ which is weakly tame at $p$ and contains an element of order $p^n$. To the best of our knowledge, an unconditional proof of the last inequality is out of the reach of all presently known techniques.;math.AG
1801.02247;A sharpening of a problem on Bernstein polynomials and convex function and related results;We present a short proof of a conjecture proposed by I. Ra\c{s}a (2017), which is an inequality involving basic Bernstein polynomials and convex functions. This proof was given in the letter to I. Ra\c{s}a (2017). The methods of our proof allow us to obtain some extended versions of this inequality as well as other inequalities given by I. Ra\c{s}a. As a tool we use stochastic convex ordering relations. We propose also some generalizations of the binomial convex concentration inequality. We use it to insert some additional expressions between left and right sides of the Ra\c{s}a inequalities.;math.CA
1801.02252;Spaces with polynomial hulls that contain no analytic discs;Extensions of the notions of polynomially and rationally convex hulls are introduced. Using these notions, a generalization of a result of Duval and Levenberg on polynomially convex hulls containing no analytic discs is presented. As a consequence it is shown that there exists a Cantor set $X$ in ${\mathbb C}^3$ with a nontrivial polynomially convex hull that contains no analytic discs. Using this Cantor set, it is shown that there exist arcs and curves in ${\mathbb C}^4$ with nontrivial polynomially convex hulls that contain no analytic discs. This answers a question raised a few years ago by Bercovici and can be regarded as a partial answer to a question raised by Wermer over 60 years ago. More generally, it is shown that every uncountable, compact subspace of a Euclidean space can be embedded as a subspace $X$ of ${\mathbb C}^N$, for some N, in such a way as to have a nontrivial polynomially convex hull that contains no analytic discs. In the case when the topological dimension of the space is at most one, $X$ can be chosen so as to have the stronger property that $P(X)$ has a dense set of invertible elements.;math.CV
1801.02259;A Dual Approximate Dynamic Programming Approach to Multi-stage Stochastic Unit Commitment;We study the multi-stage stochastic unit commitment problem in which commitment and generation decisions can be made and adjusted in each time period. We formulate this problem as a Markov decision process, which is "weakly-coupled" in the sense that if the demand constraint is relaxed, the problem decomposes into a separate, low-dimensional, Markov decision process for each generator. We demonstrate how the dual approximate dynamic programming method of Barty, Carpentier, and Girardeau (RAIRO Operations Research, 44:167-183, 2010) can be adapted to obtain bounds and a policy for this problem. Previous approaches have let the Lagrange multipliers depend only on time, this can result in weak lower bounds. Other approaches have let the multipliers depend on the entire history of past random observations, although this provides a strong lower bound, its ability to handle a large number of sample paths or scenarios is limited. We demonstrate how to bridge these approaches for the stochastic unit commitment problem by letting the multipliers depend on the current observed demand. This allows a good tradeoff between strong lower bounds and good scalability with the number of scenarios. We illustrate this approach numerically on a 168-stage stochastic unit commitment problem, including minimum uptime, downtime, and ramping constraints.;math.OC
1801.02260;Divisibility classes are seldom closed under flat covers;It is well-known that a class of all modules, which are torsion-free with respect to a set of ideals, is closed under injective envelopes. In this paper, we consider a kind of a dual to this statement - are the divisibility classes closed under flat covers? - and argue that this is seldom the case. More precisely, we show that the class of all divisible modules over an integral domain R is closed under flat covers if and only if R is almost perfect. Also, we show that if the class of all s-divisible modules, where s is a regular element of a commutative ring R, is closed under flat covers then the quotient ring R/sR satisfies some rather restrictive properties. The question is motivated by the recent classification [11] of tilting classes over commutative rings.;math.AC

Furthermore, this paper will examine the existence of magic polygons, along with several other properties inherent to magic polygons.;math.CO

1801.02274;Cancellation for surfaces revisited. II;Let $X$ and $X'$ be affine algebraic varieties over a field $\mathbb{k}$. The celebrated Zariski Cancellation Problem asks as to when the existence of an isomorphism $X\times\mathbb{A}^n\cong X'\times\mathbb{A}^n$ implies $X\cong X'$. In Part I of this paper (<a href="/abs/1610.01805">arXiv:1610.01805</a>) we provided a criterion for cancellation in the case where $X$ is a normal affine surface admitting an $\mathbb{A}^1$-fibration $X\to B$ over a smooth affine curve $B$. If $X$ does not admit such an $\mathbb{A}^1$-fibration then the cancellation by the affine line is known to hold for $X$ by a result of Bandman and Makar-Limanov. In the present Part II we classify all pairs $(X,X')$ of smooth affine surfaces $\mathbb{A}^1$-fibered over $B$ with only reduced fibers whose cylinders $X\times\mathbb{A}^1$, $X'\times\mathbb{A}^1$ are isomorphic over $B$. Our criterion of isomorphism of cylinders over $B$ is expressed in terms of linear equivalence of certain divisors on the Danielewski-Fieseler quotient of $X$ over $B$. Under a mild restriction we construct a coarse moduli of such surfaces.;math.AG

We give a explicit construction of Verma modules over the ${\mathbb Z}_2 \otimes {\mathbb Z}_2$ graded superalgebra and show their reducibility by using singular vectors. The explicit formula of singular vectors are given and are used to derive partial differential equations invariant under the color supergroup generated by the ${\mathbb Z}_2 \otimes {\mathbb Z}_2$ graded superalgebra.;math-ph
1801.02276;Bounds for Laplace eigenvalues of Kaehler metrics;We prove inequalities for Laplace eigenvalues of Kaehler manifolds generalising to higher eigenvalues the classical inequality for the first Laplace eigenvalue due to Bourguignon, Li, and Yau in 1994. We also obtain similar inequalities for analytic varieties in Kaehler manifolds.;math.DG
1801.02278;Banach Spaces from Barriers in High Dimensional Ellentuck Spaces;A new hierarchy of Banach spaces $T_k(d,\theta)$, $k$ any positive integer, is constructed using barriers in high dimensional Ellentuck spaces \cite{DobrinenJSL15} following the classical framework under which a Tsirelson type norm is defined from a barrier in the Ellentuck space \cite{Argyros/TodorcevicBK}. The following structural properties of these spaces are proved. Each of these spaces contains arbitrarily large copies of $\ell_\infty^n$, with the bound constant for all $n$. For each fixed pair $d$ and $\theta$, the spaces $T_k(d,\theta)$, $k\ge 1$, are $\ell_p$-saturated, forming natural extensions of the $\ell_p$ space, where $p$ satisfies $d\theta=d^{1/p}$. Moreover, they form a strict hierarchy over the $\ell_p$ space: For any $j&lt,k$, the space $T_j(d,\theta)$ embeds isometrically into $T_k(d,\theta)$ as a subspace which is non-isomorphic to $T_k(d,\theta)$.;math.LO
1801.02282;Arithmetic surfaces and adelic quotient groups;We explicitly calculate an arithmetic adelic quotient group for a locally free sheaf on an arithmetic surface when the fiber over the infinite point of the base is taken into account. The calculations are presented via a short exact sequence. We relate the last term of this short exact sequence with the projective limit of groups which are finite direct products of copies of one-dimensional real torus and are connected with first cohomology groups of locally free sheaves on the arithmetic surface.;math.AG
1801.02283;Computing the average root number of an elliptic surface;By considering a one-parameter family of elliptic curves defined over $\mathbb{Q}$, we might ask ourselves if there is any bias in the distribution (or parity) of the root numbers at each specialization. From the work of Helfgott, we know (at least conjecturally) that the average root number of an elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb{Q}(T)$ is zero as soon as there is a place of multiplicative reduction over $\mathbb{Q}(T)$ other than $-$deg. Recently, Helfgott's work was extended by Desjardins, where she relaxes some of Helfgott's hypotheses and is able to provide unconditional results on the variation of the root number for many elliptic surfaces. <br />In this paper, we are concerned with elliptic curves defined over $\mathbb{Q}(T)$ with no place of multiplicative reduction over $\mathbb{Q}(T)$, except possibly at $-$deg. More precisely, we will use the work of Helfgott to compute the average root number of an explicit family of elliptic curves defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ and show that this family is "parity-biased" infinitely-often.;math.NT
1801.02285;Global existence and well-posedness for the Doi-Edwards polymer model;In this paper we mainly investigate the Cauchy problem of the Doi-Edwards polymer model with dimension $d\geq2$. The model was derived in the late 1970s to describe the dynamics of polymers in melts. The system contain a Navier-Stokes equation with an additional stress tensor which depend on the deformation gradient tensor and the memory function. The deformation gradient tensor satisfies a transport equation and the memory function satisfies a degenerate parabolic equation. We first proved the local well-posedness for the Doi-Edwards polymer model in Besov spaces by using the Littlewood-Paley theory. Moreover, if the initial velocity and the initial memory is small enough, we obtain a global existence result.;math.AP
1801.02287;Explicit Constructions of MBR and MSR Codes for Clustered Distributed Storage;This paper considers capacity-achieving coding for the clustered form of distributed storage that reflects practical storage networks. To reflect the clustered structure with limited cross-cluster communication bandwidths, nodes in the same cluster are set to communicate $\beta_I$ symbols, while nodes in other clusters can communicate $\beta_c \leq \beta_I$ symbols with one another. We provide two types of exact regenerating codes which achieve the capacity of clustered distributed storage: the minimum-bandwidth-regenerating (MBR) codes and the minimum-storage-regenerating (MSR) codes. First, we construct MBR codes for general parameter settings of clustered distributed storage. The suggested MBR code is a generalization of an existing code proposed by Rashmi et al., for scenarios where storage nodes are dispersed into L &gt, 1 clusters. The proposed MBR code for the $\beta_c = 0$ case requires a much smaller field size compared to existing local MBR codes. Secondly, we devise MSR codes for clustered distributed storage. Focus is given on two important cases:$\epsilon=0$ and $\epsilon \in [1/(n-k), 1]$, where $\epsilon=\beta_c/\beta_I$ is the ratio of the available cross- to intra-cluster repair bandwidths, n is the total number of distributed nodes and k is the number of contact nodes in data retrieval. The former represents the scenario where cross-cluster communication is not allowed, while the latter corresponds to the case of minimum node storage overhead. For $\epsilon=0$, two existing locally repairable codes are proven to be MSR codes for the clustered model. For $\epsilon \in [1/(n-k), 1]$, existing MSR codes for the non-clustered model are applicable to clustered scenarios with a simple modification.;cs.IT
1801.02297;Convergence rates in homogenization of higher order parabolic systems;This paper is concerned with the optimal convergence rate in homogenization of higher order parabolic systems with bounded measurable, rapidly oscillating periodic coefficients. The sharp $O(\va)$ convergence rate in the space $L^2(0,T, H^{m-1}(\Om))$ is obtained for both the initial-Dirichlet problem and the initial-Neumann problem. The duality argument inspired by \cite{suslinaD2013} is used here.;math.AP
1801.02298;Depth Sequence Coding with Hierarchical Partitioning and Spatial-domain Quantisation;Depth coding in 3D-HEVC for the multiview video plus depth (MVD) architecture (i) deforms object shapes due to block-level edge-approximation, (ii) misses an opportunity for high compressibility at near-lossless quality by failing to exploit strong homogeneity (clustering tendency) in depth syntax, motion vector components, and residuals at frame-level, and (iii) restricts interactivity and limits responsiveness of independent use of depth information for "non-viewing" applications due to texture-depth coding dependency. This paper presents a standalone depth sequence coder, which operates in the lossless to near-lossless quality range while compressing depth data superior to lossy 3D-HEVC. It preserves edges implicitly by limiting quantisation to the spatial-domain and exploits clustering tendency efficiently at frame-level with a novel binary tree based decomposition (BTBD) technique. For mono-view coding of standard MVD test sequences, on average, (i) lossless BTBD achieved $\times 42.2$ compression-ratio and $-60.0\%$ coding gain against the pseudo-lossless 3D-HEVC, using the lowest quantisation parameter $QP = 1$, and (ii) near-lossless BTBD achieved $-79.4\%$ and $6.98$ dB Bj{\o}ntegaard delta bitrate (BD-BR) and distortion (BD-PSNR), respectively, against 3D-HEVC. In view-synthesis applications, decoded depth maps from BTBD rendered superior quality synthetic-views, compared to 3D-HEVC, with $-18.9\%$ depth BD-BR and $0.43$ dB synthetic-texture BD-PSNR on average.;cs.IT
1801.02301;An estimate on energy of min-max Seiberg-Witten Floer generators;Previously, Cristofaro-Gardiner, Hutchings and Ramos have proved that embedded contact homology (ECH) capacities can recover the volume of a contact 3-manifod in their paper "the asymptotics of ECH capacities" . There were two main steps to proving this theorem: The first step used an estimate for the energy of min-max Seiberg-Witten Floer generators. The second step used embedded balls in a certain symplectic four manifold. <br />In this paper, stronger estimates on the energy of min-max Seiberg-Witten Floer generators are derived. This stronger estimate implies directly the "ECH capacities recover volume" theorem (without the help of embedded balls in a certain symplectic four manifold), and moreover, gives an estimate on its speed.;math.SG
1801.02306;Linear-Quadratic Mean Field Control: The Hamiltonian Matrix and Invariant Subspace Method;This paper studies the existence and uniqueness of a solution to linear quadratic (LQ) mean field social optimization problems with uniform agents.

1801.02307;Geometric Quantization;Geometric quantization is an attempt at using the differential-geometric ingredients of classical phase spaces regarded as symplectic manifolds in order to define a corresponding quantum theory. Generally, the process of geometric quantization is applicable to other symplectic manifolds, not only cotangent spaces. The resulting formalism provides a way of looking at quantum theory that is distinct from conventional approaches to the subject, e.g., the Dirac bra-ket formalism. In particular, such familiar features as the quantization of spin, the canonical quantization of position and momentum, and the Schr\"{o}dinger equation all emerge from geometric quantization. This paper serves as a review of the subject written in an informal style, often taking an example-based approach to exposition, and attempts to present the material without assuming the reader is an expert in differential geometry.;math-ph
1801.02308;Joint Transmitter and Receiver Design for Pattern Division Multiple Access;In this paper, a joint transmitter and receiver design for pattern division multiple access (PDMA) is proposed. At the transmitter, pattern mapping utilizes power allocation to improve the overall sum rate, and beam allocation to enhance the access connectivity. At the receiver, hybrid detection utilizes a spatial filter to suppress the inter-beam interference caused by beam domain multiplexing, and successive interference cancellation to remove the intra-beam interference caused by power domain multiplexing. Furthermore, we propose a PDMA joint design approach to optimize pattern mapping based on both the power domain and beam domain. The optimization of power allocation is achieved by maximizing the overall sum rate, and the corresponding optimization problem is shown to be convex theoretically. The optimization of beam allocation is achieved by minimizing the maximum of the inner product of any two beam allocation vectors, and an effective dimension reduction method is proposed through the analysis of pattern structure and proper mathematical manipulations. Simulation results show that the proposed PDMA approach outperforms the orthogonal multiple access and power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access approaches even without any optimization of pattern mapping, and that the optimization of beam allocation yields a significant performance improvement than the optimization of power allocation.;cs.IT
1801.02310;Efficient Encoding/Decoding of Irreducible Words for Codes Correcting Tandem Duplications;Tandem duplication is the process of inserting a copy of a segment of DNA adjacent to the original position. Motivated by applications that store data in living organisms, Jain et al. (2017) proposed the study of codes that correct tandem duplications. Known code constructions are based on {\em irreducible words}. <br />We study efficient encoding/decoding methods for irreducible words. First, we describe an $(\ell,m)$-finite state encoder and show that when $m=\Theta(1/\epsilon)$ and $\ell=\Theta(1/\epsilon)$, the encoder achieves rate that is $\epsilon$ away from the optimal. Next, we provide ranking/unranking algorithms for irreducible words and modify the algorithms to reduce the space requirements for the finite state encoder.;cs.IT
1801.02312;Newton diagram of positivity for ${}_1F_2$ generalized hypergeometric functions;As for the positivity of ${}_1F_2$ generalized hypergeometric functions, we present a list of necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of parameters and determine the region of positivity by certain Newton diagram.;math.CA
1801.02313;Probability distributions of multi-species q-TAZRP and ASEP as double cosets of parabolic subgroups;We write explicit contour integral formulas for probability distributions of the multi-species q-TAZRP and the multi-species ASEP starting with q-exchangeable initial conditions. The formulas are equal to the corresponding explicit contour integral formulas for the single-species q-TAZRP ([Korhonen-Lee 2014, Wang-Waugh 2016]) and ASEP [Tracy-Widom 2007], with a factor in front of the integral. <br />For the multi-species q-TAZRP, we use a decomposition theorem for elements of double cosets of parabolic subgroups in a Coxeter group. The set of distinguished double coset representatives with minimal length is viewed as a particle configuration. For the multi-species ASEP we use a more direct proof.;math.PR
1801.02314;A Mixed Finite Element Method for Multi-Cavity Computation in Incompressible Nonlinear Elasticity;A mixed finite element method combining an iso-parametric $Q_2$-$P_1$ element and an iso-parametric $P_2^+$-$P_1$ element is developed for the computation of multiple cavities in incompressible nonlinear elasticity. The method is analytically proved to be locking-free and convergent, and it is also shown to be numerically accurate and efficient by numerical experiments. Furthermore, the newly developed accurate method enables us to find an interesting new bifurcation phenomenon in multi-cavity growth.;math.AP
1801.02315;Generalized Reed-Solomon Codes with Sparsest and Balanced Generator Matrices;We prove that for any positive integers $n$ and $k$ such that $n\!\geq\! k\!\geq\! 1$, there exists an $[n,k]$ generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) code that has a sparsest and balanced generator matrix (SBGM) over any finite field of size $q\!\geq\! n\!+\!\lceil\frac{k(k-1)}{n}\rceil$, where sparsest means that each row of the generator matrix has the least possible number of nonzeros, while balanced means that the number of nonzeros in any two columns differ by at most one. Previous work by Dau et al (ISIT'13) showed that there always exists an MDS code that has an SBGM over any finite field of size $q\geq {n-1\choose k-1}$, and Halbawi et al (ISIT'16, ITW'16) showed that there exists a cyclic Reed-Solomon code (i.e., $n=q-1$) with an SBGM for any prime power $q$. Hence, this work extends both of the previous results.;cs.IT
1801.02321;Log-Scale Shrinkage Priors and Adaptive Bayesian Global-Local Shrinkage Estimation;Global-local shrinkage hierarchies are an important innovation in Bayesian estimation. We propose the use of log-scale distributions as a novel basis for generating familes of prior distributions for local shrinkage hyperparameters. By varying the scale parameter one may vary the degree to which the prior distribution promotes sparsity in the coefficient estimates. By examining the class of distributions over the logarithm of the local shrinkage parameter that have log-linear, or sub-log-linear tails, we show that many standard prior distributions for local shrinkage parameters can be unified in terms of the tail behaviour and concentration properties of their corresponding marginal distributions over the coefficients $\beta_j$. We derive upper bounds on the rate of concentration around $|\beta_j|=0$, and the tail decay as $|\beta_j| \to \infty$, achievable by this wide class of prior distributions. <br />We then propose a new type of ultra-heavy tailed prior, called the log-$t$ prior with the property that, irrespective of the choice of associated scale parameter, the marginal distribution always diverges at $\beta_j = 0$, and always possesses super-Cauchy tails. We develop results demonstrating when prior distributions with (sub)-log-linear tails attain Kullback--Leibler super-efficiency and prove that the log-$t$ prior distribution is always super-efficient. We show that the log-$t$ prior is less sensitive to misspecification of the global shrinkage parameter than the horseshoe or lasso priors. By incorporating the scale parameter of the log-scale prior distributions into the Bayesian hierarchy we derive novel adaptive shrinkage procedures. Simulations show that the adaptive log-$t$ procedure appears to always perform well, irrespective of the level of sparsity or signal-to-noise ratio of the underlying model.;math.ST
1801.02323;Representation category of the quantum double of ${\rm SL}(2,q)$;For each odd prime power $q$ with $q\ge 5$ and $4\mid q-1$, we investigate the structure of the representation category of the quantum double of ${\rm SL}(2,q)$, determining its tensor products and braidings.;math.RT
1801.02324;Building Capacity-Achieving PIR Schemes with Optimal Sub-Packetization over Small Fields;Suppose a database containing $M$ records is replicated across $N$ servers, and a user wants to privately retrieve one record by accessing the servers such that identity of the retrieved record is secret against any up to $T$ servers. A scheme designed for this purpose is called a $T$-private information retrieval ($T$-PIR) scheme. Three indexes are concerned for PIR schemes: (1)rate, indicating the amount of retrieved information per unit of downloaded data. The highest achievable rate is characterized by the capacity, (2) sub-packetization, reflexing the implementation complexity for linear schemes, (3) field size. We consider linear schemes over a finite field. In this paper, a general $T$-PIR scheme simultaneously attaining the optimality of almost all of the three indexes is presented. Specifically, we design a linear capacity-achieving $T$-PIR scheme with sub-packetization $\!dn^{M-1}\!$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, $q\geq N$. The sub-packetization $\!dn^{M-1}\!$, where $\!d\!=\!{\rm gcd}(N,T)\!$ and $\!n\!=\!N/d$, has been proved to be optimal in our previous work. The field size of all existing capacity-achieving $T$-PIR schemes must be larger than $Nt^{M-2}$ where $t=T/d$, while our scheme reduces the field size by an exponential factor.;cs.IT

1801.02329;Grassmannian Codes with New Distance Measures for Network Coding;Grassmannian codes are known to be useful in error-correction for random network coding. Recently, they were used to prove that vector network codes outperform scalar linear network codes, on multicast networks, with respect to the alphabet size. The multicast networks which were used for this purpose are generalized combination networks. In both the scalar and the vector network coding solutions, the subspace distance is used as the distance measure for the codes which solve the network coding problem in the generalized combination networks. In this work we show that the subspace distance can be replaced with two other possible distance measures which generalize the subspace distance. These two distance measures are shown to be equivalent under an orthogonal transformation. It is proved that the Grassmannian codes with the new distance measures generalize the Grassmannian codes with the subspace distance and the subspace designs with the strength of the design. Furthermore, optimal Grassmannian codes with the new distance measureshave minimal requirements for network coding solutions of some generalized combination networks. The coding problems related to these two distance measures, especially with respect to network coding, are discussed. Finally, by using these new concepts it is proved that codes in the Hamming scheme form a subfamily of the Grassmannian codes.;cs.IT
1801.02331;Global Asymptotic Stability for General Linear MIMO Distributed Systems: An Approach Based on Robust-Adaptive Controllers;Stability is a critical feature of distributed linear multi-input-multi-output systems. Global asymptotic stability usually can be guaranteed when using decentralised or distributed control architectures, if: (i) conservative controllers are designed, (ii) collective stability conditions are satisfied, or (iii) interaction terms are neutral. This paper extends the collective stability method to incorporate adaptive controllers, and shows that this method is insufficient for systems with large-gain interconnections. Subsequently, we show that global asymptotic stability can be systematically ensured by exploiting vector Lyapunov functions and algebraic Riccati equations. This leads to a scalable distributed architecture where local controllers require information from corresponding subsystems and neighbouring controllers. Conveniently, the communication flow has the same topology as the interconnection graph. Theoretical results are validated through application of the proposed architecture to voltage control of a DC power network.;math.OC
1801.02333;The inertialess limit of particle sedimentation modeled by the Vlasov-Stokes equations;We study the Vlasov-Stokes equations which macroscopically model the sedimentation of a cloud of particles in a fluid, where particle inertia are taken into account but fluid inertia are assumed to be negligible. We consider the limit when the inertia of the particles tends to zero, and obtain convergence of the dynamics to the solution of an associated inertialess system of equations. This system coincides with the model that can be derived as the homogenization limit of the microscopic inertialess dynamics.;math.AP
1801.02339;A correction of the decomposability result in a paper by Meyer-Neutsch;In this short note, it is shown that there is a gap in the proof of Theorem 11 in the paper of Meyer and Neutsch (J. of Algebra, 1993). We prove, nevertheless, that the statement of the theorem is true and fix the proof by using a certain extremal property of idempotents which has an independent interest.;math.RA
1801.02340;Lifting a prescribed group of automorphisms of graphs;In this paper we are interested in lifting a prescribed group of automorphisms of a finite graph via regular covering projections. Here we describe with an example the problems we address and refer to the introductory section for the correct statements of our results. <br />Let $P$ be the Petersen graph, say, and let $\wp:\tilde{P}\to P$ be a regular covering projection. With the current covering machinery, it is straightforward to find $\wp$ with the property that every subgroup of $\Aut(P)$ lifts via $\wp$. However, for constructing peculiar examples and in applications, this is usually not enough. Sometimes it is important, given a subgroup $G$ of $\Aut(P)$, to find $\wp$ along which $G$ lifts but no further automorphism of $P$ does. For instance, in this concrete example, it is interesting to find a covering of the Petersen graph lifting the alternating group $A_5$ but not the whole symmetric group $S_5$. (Recall that $\Aut(P)\cong S_5$.) Some other time it is important, given a subgroup $G$ of $\Aut(P)$, to find $\wp$ with the property that $\Aut(\tilde{P})$ is the lift of $G$. Typically, it is desirable to find $\wp$ satisfying both conditions. In a very broad sense, this might remind wallpaper patterns on surfaces: the group of symmetries of the dodecahedron is $S_5$, and there is a nice colouring of the dodecahedron (found also by Escher) whose group of symmetries is just $A_5$. <br />In this paper, we address this problem in full generality.;math.CO

Hereinafter the conditions are determined for convergence of Galerkin and collocation methods for solving Fredholm integral equations of the first kind for simple layer potential that is equivalent to Dirichlet problem for Laplace equation in R3. Estimation is determined for the error of approximate solution of this problem obtained using potential theory methods.;math.NA

1801.02347;Groups acting on rooted trees and their representations on the boundary;We consider groups that act on spherically symmetric rooted trees and study the associated representation of the group on the space of locally constant functions on the boundary of the tree. We introduce and discuss the new notion of locally 2-transitive actions. Assuming local 2-transitivity our main theorem yields a precise decomposition of the boundary representation into irreducible constituents. <br />The method can be used to study Gelfand pairs and enables us to answer a question of Grigorchuk. To provide examples, we analyse in detail the local 2-transitivity of GGS-groups. Moreover, our results can be used to determine explicit formulae for zeta functions of induced representations defined by Klopsch and the author.;math.GR

To achieve this, first we propose a suitable meaning of a weak solution, show their existence and uniqueness, and establish a probabilistic representation in terms of time-changed Brownian motion. As an application, we also discuss an inverse source problem.;math.AP

In this paper, we formulate a game when NOMA is applied to ALOHA to decide the transmission probability. We consider a payoff function based on an energy-efficiency metric and drive the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (NE).;cs.IT
1801.02353;Exponential stability of general 1-D quasilinear systems with source terms for the $C^1$ norm under boundary conditions;We address the question of the exponential stability for the $C^{1}$ norm of general 1-D quasilinear systems with source terms under boundary conditions. To reach this aim, we introduce the notion of basic $C^{1}$ Lyapunov functions, a generic kind of exponentially decreasing function whose existence ensures the exponential stability of the system for the $C^{1}$ norm. We show that the existence of a basic $C^{1}$ Lyapunov function is subject to two conditions: an interior condition, intrinsic to the system, and a condition on the boundary controls. We give explicit sufficient interior and boundary conditions such that the system is exponentially stable for the $C^{1}$ norm and we show that the interior condition is also necessary to the existence of a basic $C^{1}$ Lyapunov function. Finally, we show that the results conducted in this article are also true under the same conditions for the exponential stability in the $C^{p}$ norm, for any $p\geq1$.;math.AP
1801.02357;Numerically destabilizing minimal discs;When calculating the index of a minimal surface, the set of smooth functions on a domain with compact support is the standard setting to describe admissible variations. We show that the set of admissible variations can be widened in a geometrically meaningful manner by considering the difference of area functional, leading to a more general notion of index. This allows us to produce explicit examples of destabilizing perturbations for the fundamental Scherk surface and dihedral Enneper surfaces. In the case of dihedral Enneper surfaces we show that both the classical and our modified index can be explicitly determined.;math.DG

Observed time series are subordinated to long-range dependent Gaussian processes and characterized by arbitrary marginal copula distributions. First of all, we establish limit theorems for the marginal and quantile marginal empirical processes of multivariate stationary long-range dependent sequences under Gaussian subordination. Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic behavior of sequential empirical copula processes under non-restrictive smoothness assumptions. The limiting processes in the case of long-memory sequences are quite different from the cases of of i.i.d. and weakly dependent observations.;math.ST

We establish the conditions under which the trace $i^!(\Phi)$ is also a Fourier integral operator and calculate its amplitude in canonical local coordinates.;math.AP
1801.02369;Elementary matrix factorizations over B&#xe9,zout domains;We study the homotopy category $\mathrm{hef}(R,W)$ (and its $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded version $\mathrm{HEF}(R,W)$) of elementary factorizations, where $R$ is a B\'ezout domain which has prime elements and $W=W_0 W_c$, where $W_0\in R^\times$ is a square-free element of $R$ and $W_c\in R^\times$ is a finite product of primes with order at least two. In this situation, we give criteria for detecting isomorphisms in $\mathrm{hef}(R,W)$ and $\mathrm{HEF}(R,W)$ and formulas for the number of isomorphism classes of objects. We also study the full subcategory $\mathbf{hef}(R,W)$ of the homotopy category $\mathrm{hmf}(R,W)$ of finite rank matrix factorizations of $W$ which is additively generated by elementary factorizations. We show that $\mathbf{hef}(R,W)$ is Krull-Schmidt and we conjecture that it coincides with $\mathrm{hmf}(R,W)$. Finally, we discuss a few classes of examples.;math.AC
1801.02370;Approximately locating an invisible agent in a graph with relative distance queries;In a pursuit evasion game on a finite, simple, undirected, and connected graph $G$, a first player visits vertices $m_1,m_2,\ldots$ of $G$, where $m_{i+1}$ is in the closed neighborhood of $m_i$ for every $i$, and a second player probes arbitrary vertices $c_1,c_2,\ldots$ of $G$, and learns whether or not the distance between $c_{i+1}$ and $m_{i+1}$ is at most the distance between $c_i$ and $m_i$. Up to what distance $d$ can the second player determine the position of the first? For trees of bounded maximum degree and grids, we show that $d$ is bounded by a constant. We conjecture that $d=O(\log n)$ for every graph $G$ of order $n$, and show that $d=0$ if $m_{i+1}$ may differ from $m_i$ only if $i$ is a multiple of some sufficiently large integer.;math.CO
1801.02373;Discrete Gaussian distributions via theta functions;We study a discrete analogue of the classical multivariate Gaussian distribution. It is supported on the integer lattice and is parametrized by the Riemann theta function. Over the reals, the discrete Gaussian is characterized by the property of maximizing entropy, just as its continuous counterpart. We capitalize on the theta function representation to derive statistical properties. Throughout, we exhibit strong connections to the study of abelian varieties in algebraic geometry.;math.AG
1801.02376;The Explicit Coding Rate Region of Symmetric Multilevel Diversity Coding;It is well known that {\em superposition coding}, namely separately encoding the independent sources, is optimal for symmetric multilevel diversity coding (SMDC) (Yeung-Zhang 1999). However, the characterization of the coding rate region therein involves uncountably many linear inequalities and the constant term (i.e., the lower bound) in each inequality is given in terms of the solution of a linear optimization problem. Thus this implicit characterization of the coding rate region does not enable the determination of the achievability of a given rate tuple. In this paper, we first obtain closed-form expressions of these uncountably many inequalities. Then we identify a finite subset of inequalities that is sufficient for characterizing the coding rate region. This gives an explicit characterization of the coding rate region. We further show by the symmetry of the problem that only a much smaller subset of this finite set of inequalities needs to be verified in determining the achievability of a given rate tuple. Yet, the cardinality of this smaller set grows at least exponentially fast with $L$. We also present a subset entropy inequality, which together with our explicit characterization of the coding rate region, is sufficient for proving the optimality of superposition coding.;cs.IT
1801.02379;How fast planar maps get swallowed by a peeling process;The peeling process is an algorithmic procedure that discovers a random planar map step by step. In generic cases such as the UIPT or the UIPQ, it is known [Curien &amp, Le Gall, Scaling limits for the peeling process on random maps, Ann. Inst. Henri Poincar\'e Probab. Stat. 53, 1 (2017), 322-357] that any peeling process will eventually discover the whole map. In this paper we study the probability that the origin is not swallowed by the peeling process until time $n$ and show it decays at least as $n^{-2c/3}$ where \[c \approx 0.12831235141783245423674486573872854933142662048339843...\] is defined via an integral equation derived using the Lamperti representation of the spectrally negative $3/2$-stable L\'evy process conditioned to remain positive [Chaumont, Kyprianou &amp, Pardo, Some explicit identities associated with positive self-similar Markov processes, Stochastic Process. Appl. 119, 3 (2009), 980-1000] which appears as a scaling limit for the perimeter process. As an application we sharpen the upper bound of the sub-diffusivity exponent for random walk of [Benjamini &amp, Curien, Simple random walk on the uniform infinite planar quadrangulation: subdiffusivity via pioneer points, Geom. Funct. Anal. 23, 2 (2013), 501-531].;math.PR
1801.02380;Generalized P&#xf3,lya Urn Schemes with Negative but Linear Reinforcements;In this paper, we consider a new type of urn scheme, where the selection probabilities are proportional to a weight function, which is linear but decreasing in the proportion of existing colours. We refer to it as the \emph{negatively reinforced} urn scheme. We establish almost sure limit of the random configuration for any \emph{balanced} replacement matrix $R$. In particular, we show that the limiting configuration is uniform on the set of colours, if and only if, $R$ is a \emph{doubly stochastic} matrix. We further establish almost sure limit of the vector of colour counts and prove central limit theorems for the random configuration, as well as, for the colour counts.;math.PR
1801.02394;Age-Optimal Updates of Multiple Information Flows;In this paper, we study an age of information minimization problem, where multiple flows of update packets are sent over multiple servers to their destinations. Two online scheduling policies are proposed. When the packet generation and arrival times are synchronized across the flows, the proposed policies are shown to be (near) optimal for minimizing any time-dependent, symmetric, and non-decreasing penalty function of the ages of the flows over time in a stochastic ordering sense.;cs.IT
1801.02401;The Extremal Function for the Complex Ball for Generalized Notions of Degree and Multivariate Polynomial Approximation;We discuss the Siciak-Zaharjuta extremal function of pluripotential theory for the unit ball in C^d for spaces of polynomials with the notion of degree determined by a convex body P. We then use it to analyze the approximation properties of such polynomial spaces, and how these may differ depending on the function f to be approximated.;math.CV
1801.02402;Higher solutions of Hitchin&#x27,s self-duality equations;Solutions of Hitchin's self-duality equations corresponds to special real sections in the Deligne-Hitchin moduli space -- twistor lines. A question posed by Simpson in 1997 asks whether all real sections give rise to global solutions of the self-duality equations. An affirmative answer would allow for complex analytic procedure to obtain all solutions of the self-duality equations. The purpose of this paper is to construct counter examples given by certain (branched) Willmore surfaces in $3$-space (with monodromy) via the generalized Whitham flow. Though these higher solutions do not give rise to global solutions of the self-duality equations on the whole Riemann surface $M$, they are solutions on an open dense subset of it. This suggest a deeper connection between Willmore surfaces, i.e., rank $4$ harmonic maps theory, with the rank $2$ self-duality theory.;math.DG
1801.02405;Distinguishing density and the Distinct Spheres Condition;If a graph $G$ has distinguishing number 2, then there exists a partition of its vertex set into two parts, such that no nontrivial automorphism of $G$ fixes setwise the two parts. Such a partition is called a 2-distinguishing coloring of $G$, and the parts are called its color classes. If $G$ admits such a coloring, it is often possible to find another in which one of the color classes is sparse in a certain sense. In this case we say that $G$ has 2-distinguishing density zero. An extreme example of this would be an infinite graph admitting a 2-distinguishing coloring in which one of the color classes is finite. <br />If a graph $G$ contains a vertex $v$ such that, for all $n \in \mathbb N$, any two distinct vertices equidistant from $v$ have nonequal $n$-spheres, then we say that $G$ satisfies the Distinct Spheres Condition. In this paper we prove a general result: any countable connected graph that satisfies the Distinct Spheres Condition is 2-distinguishable with density zero. We present two proofs of this, one that uses a deterministic coloring, and another (that applies only to locally finite graphs) using a random coloring. From this result, we deduce that several important families of countably infinite and connected graphs are 2-distinguishable with density zero, including those that are locally finite and primitive. Furthermore, we prove that any connected graph with infinite motion and subquadratic growth is 2-distinguishable with density zero.;math.CO
1801.02406;Tate&#x27,s conjecture and the Tate-Shafarevich group over global function fields;Let $\mathcal X$ be a regular variety, flat and proper over a complete regular curve over a finite field, such that the generic fiber $X$ is smooth and geometrically connected. We prove that the Brauer group of $\mathcal X$ is finite if and only Tate's conjecture for divisors on $X$ holds and the Tate-Shafarevich group of the Albanese variety of $X$ is finite, generalizing a theorem of Artin and Grothendieck for surfaces to arbitrary relative dimension. We also give a formula relating the orders of the group under the assumption that they are finite, generalizing the formula given for a surface.;math.NT
1801.02410;Chains of P-points;It is proved that the Continuum Hypothesis implies that any sequence of rapid P-points of length $&lt,{\mathfrak c}^{+}$ which is increasing with respect to the Rudin-Keisler ordering is bounded above by a rapid P-point. This is an improvement of a result from [Kuzeljevi\'c, Raghavan: A long chain of P-points, arxiv:<a href="/abs/1607.07188">1607.07188</a> [math.LO]]. It is also proved that the notion of a $\delta$-generic sequence is equivalent to an apparently much weaker notion. This allows the central definition used in the construction in [Kuzeljevi\'c, Raghavan: A long chain of P-points, arxiv:<a href="/abs/1607.07188">1607.07188</a> [math.LO]] to be considerably simplified.;math.LO
1801.02412;p-adic limits of renormalized logarithmic Euler characteristics;Given a countable residually finite group $\Gamma$, we write $\Gamma_n \to e$ if $(\Gamma_n)$ is a sequence of normal subgroups of finite index such that any infinite intersection of $\Gamma_n$'s contains only the unit element $e$ of $\Gamma$. Given a $\Gamma$-module $M$ we are interested in the multiplicative Euler characteristics \begin{equation} \chi (\Gamma_n , M) = \prod_i |H_i (\Gamma_n , M)|^{(-1)^i} \end{equation} and the limit in the field $\mathbb{Q}_p$ of $p$-adic numbers \begin{equation} h_p := \lim_{n\to\infty} (\Gamma : \Gamma_n)^{-1} \log_p \chi (\Gamma_n , M) \, . \end{equation} Here $\log_p : \mathbb{Q}^{\times}_p \to \mathbb{Z}_p$ is the branch of the $p$-adic logarithm with $\log_p (p) = 0$. Of course, neither expression will exist in general. We isolate conditions on $M$, in particular $p$-adic expansiveness which guarantee that the Euler characteristics $\chi (\Gamma_n , M)$ are well defined. That notion is a $p$-adic analogue of expansiveness of the dynamical system given by the $\Gamma$-action on the compact Pontrjagin dual $X = M^*$ of $M$. Under further conditions on $\Gamma$ we also show that the renormalized $p$-adic limit in the second formula exists and equals the $p$-adic $R$-torsion of $M$. The latter is a $p$-adic analogue of the Li--Thom $L^2$ $R$-torsion of a $\Gamma$-module $M$ which they related to the entropy $h$ of the $\Gamma$-action on $X$. We view the limit $h_p$ as a version of entropy which values in the $p$-adic numbers and the equality with $p$-adic $R$-torsion as an analogue of the Li--Thom formula in the expansive case. We discuss the case $\Gamma = \mathbb{Z}^N$ in more detail where our theory is related to Serre's intersection numbers on arithmetic schemes.;math.GR
1801.02413;On flexible sequences;In the setting of nonstandard analysis we introduce the notion of flexible sequence. The terms of flexible sequences are external numbers. These are a sort of analogue for the classical \emph{O$ (\cdot ) $} and \emph{o$ (\cdot ) $} notation for functions, and have algebraic properties similar to those of real numbers. The flexibility originates from the fact that external numbers are stable under some shifts, additions and multiplications. We introduce two forms of convergence, and study their relation. We show that the usual properties of convergence of sequences hold or can be adapted to these new notions of convergence and give some applications.;math.LO
1801.02421;The N=2 supersymmetric Calogero-Sutherland model and its eigenfunctions;In a recent work, we have initiated the theory of N=2 symmetric superpolynomials. As far as the classical bases are concerned, this is a rather straightforward generalization of the N=1 case. However this construction could not be generalized to the formulation of Jack superpolynomials. The origin of this obstruction is unraveled here, opening the path for building the desired Jack extension. Those are shown to be obtained from the non-symmetric Jack polynomials by a suitable symmetrization procedure and an appropriate dressing by the anticommuting variables. This construction is substantiated by the characterization of the N=2 Jack superpolynomials as the eigenfunctions of the N=2 supersymmetric version of the Calogero-Sutherland model, for which, as a side result, we demonstrate the complete integrability by displaying the explicit form of four towers of mutually commuting (bosonic) conserved quantities. The N=2 Jack superpolynomials are orthogonal with respect to the analytical scalar product (induced by the quantum-mechanical formulation) as well as a new combinatorial scalar product defined on a suitable deformation of the power-sum basis.;math-ph
1801.02423;Enumeration and randomized constructions of hypertrees;Over thirty years ago, Kalai proved a beautiful $d$-dimensional analog of Cayley's formula for the number of $n$-vertex trees. He enumerated $d$-dimensional hypertrees weighted by the squared size of their $(d-1)$-dimensional homology group. This, however, does not answer the more basic problem of unweighted enumeration of $d$-hypertrees, which is our concern here. Our main result, Theorem 1.4, significantly improves the lower bound for the number of $d$-hypertrees. In addition, we study a random $1$-out model of $d$-complexes where every $(d-1)$-dimensional face selects a random $d$-face containing it, and show it has a negligible $d$-dimensional homology.;math.CO
1801.02425;Symmetric solutions for a partial differential elliptic equation that arises in stochastic production planning with production constraints;In this article we consider the question of the existence of positive symmetric solutions to the problems of the following type $\Delta u=a\left( \left\vert x\right\vert \right) h\left( u\right) +b\left( \left\vert x\right\vert \right) g\left( u\right) $ for $x\in \mathbb{R}^{N}$, which are called entire large solutions. Here $N\geq 3$, and we assume that $a$ and $b$ are nonnegative continuous spherically symmetric functions on $\mathbb{R}% ^{N} $. We extend results previously obtained for special cases of $h$ and $% g $ and we will describe a real-world model in which such problems may arise.;math.OC
1801.02428;Quadratic Transformations of Hypergeometric Function and Series with Harmonic Numbers;In this brief note, we show how to apply Kummer's and other quadratic transformation formulas for Gauss' and generalized hypergeometric functions in order to obtain transformation and summation formulas for series with harmonic numbers that contain one or two continuous parameters. We also give a generating function of the sequence $\frac{(a)_n (1-a)_n}{(n!)^2}H_n$ as a combination of Gauss hypergeometric function and elementary functions.;math.CA
1801.02431;Hessian of the Ricci Calabi functional;The Ricci Calabi functional is a functional on the space of K\"ahler metrics of Fano manifolds. Its critical points are called generalized K\"ahler Einstein metrics. In this article, we show that the Hessian of the Ricci Calabi functional is non-negative at generalized K\"ahler Einstein metrics. As its application, we give another proof of a Matsushima's type decomposition theorem for holomorphic vector fields, which was originally proved by Mabuchi. We also discuss a relation to the inverse Monge-Amp\`ere flow developed recently by Collins-Hisamoto-Takahashi.;math.DG
1801.02432;On Absolutely Norm attaining Operators;We give necessary and sufficient conditions for a bounded operator defined between complex Hilbert spaces to be absolutely norm attaining.

1801.02442;Precoding via Approximate Message Passing with Instantaneous Signal Constraints;This paper proposes a low complexity precoding algorithm based on the recently proposed Generalized Least Square Error (GLSE) scheme with generic penalty and support. The algorithm iteratively constructs the transmit vector via Approximate Message Passing (AMP). Using the asymptotic decoupling property of GLSE precoders, we derive closed form fixed point equations to tune the parameters in the proposed algorithm for a general set of instantaneous signal constraints. The tuning strategy is then utilized to construct transmit vectors with restricted peak-to-average power ratios and to efficiently select a subset of transmit antennas. The numerical investigations show that the proposed algorithm tracks the large-system performance of GLSE precoders even for a moderate number of antennas.;cs.IT
1801.02446;Convergence in variation of solutions of nonlinear Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations to stationary measures;We study convergence in variation of probability solutions of nonlinear Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations to stationary solutions. We obtain sufficient conditions for the exponential convergence of solutions to the stationary solution in case of coefficients that can have an arbitrary growth at infinity and depend on the solutions through convolutions with unbounded discontinuous kernels. In addition, we study a more difficult case where the nonlinear equation has several stationary solutions and convergence to a stationary solution depends on initial data. Finally, we obtain sufficient conditions for solvability of nonlinear Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations.;math.PR
1801.02456;Coprime Subdegrees of Twisted Wreath Permutation Groups;Dolfi, Guralnick, Praeger and Spiga asked if there exist infinitely many primitive groups of twisted wreath type with nontrivial coprime subdegrees. Here we settle this question in the affirmative. We construct infinite families of primitive twisted wreath permutation groups with nontrivial coprime subdegrees. In particular, we define a primitive twisted wreath group $G(m,q)$ constructed from the nonabelian simple group $\text{PSL}(2,q)$ and a primitive permutation group of diagonal type with socle $\text{PSL}(2,q)^m$, and determine all values of $m$ and $q$ for which $G(m,q)$ has nontrivial coprime subdegrees. In the case where $m=2$ and $q\notin\{7,11,29\}$ we obtain a full classification of all pairs of nontrivial coprime subdegrees.;math.GR
1801.02465;Extremes of vector-valued Gaussian processes with Trend;Let $X(t)=(X_1(t), \dots, X_n(t)), t\in \mathcal{T}\subset \mathbb{R} $ be a centered vector-valued Gaussian process with independent components and continuous trajectories, and $h(t)=(h_1(t),\dots, h_n(t)), t\in \mathcal{T} $ be a vector-valued continuous function. We investigate the asymptotics of $$\mathbb{P}\left(\sup_{t\in \mathcal{T} } \min_{1\leq i\leq n}(X_i(t)+h_i(t))&gt,u\right)$$ as $u\to\infty$. As an illustration to the derived results we analyze two important classes of $X(t)$: with locally-stationary structure and with varying variances of the coordinates, and calculate exact asymptotics of simultaneous ruin probability and ruin time in a Gaussian risk model.;math.PR
1801.02467;Fixed Points of anti-attracting maps and Eigenforms on Fractals;An important problem in analysis on fractals is the existence of a self-similar energy on finitely ramified fractals. The self-similar energies are constructed in terms of eigenforms, that is, eigenvectors of a special nonlinear operator. Previous results by C. Sabot and V. Metz give conditions for the existence of an eigenform. In this paper, I give a different and probably shorter proof of the previous results, which appears to be suitable for improvements. Such a proof is based on a fixed-point theorem for anti-attracting maps on a convex set.;math.FA
1801.02469;The time of ultimate recovery in Gaussian risk model;We analyze the distance $\mathcal{R}_T(u)$ between the first and the last passage time of $\{X(t)-ct:t\in [0,T]\}$ at level $u$ in time horizon $T\in(0,\infty]$, where $X$ is a centered Gaussian process with stationary increments and $c\in\mathbb{R}$, given that the first passage time occurred before $T$. Under some tractable assumptions on $X$, we find $\Delta(u)$ and $G(x)$ such that $$\lim_{u\to\infty}\mathbb{P}\left(\mathcal{R}_T(u)&gt,\Delta(u)x\right)=G(x),$$ for $x\geq 0$. We distinguish two scenarios: $T&lt,\infty$ and $T=\infty$, that lead to qualitatively different asymptotics. The obtained results provide exact asymptotics of the ultimate recovery time after the ruin in Gaussian risk model.;math.PR
1801.02473;A survey on Tingley&#x27,s problem for operator algebras;We survey the most recent results on extension of isometries between special subsets of the unit spheres of C$^*$-algebras, von Neumann algebras, trace class operators, preduals of von Neumann algebras, and $p$-Schatten-von Neumann spaces, with special interest on Tingley's problem.;math.OA
1801.02479;Hyperbolicity notions for varieties defined over a non-Archimedean field;Firstly, we pursue the work of W. Cherry on the analogue of the Kobayashi semi distance dCK that he introduced for analytic spaces defined over a non-Archimedean metrized field k. We prove various characterizations of smooth projective varieties for which dCK is an actual distance. Secondly, we explore several notions of hyperbolicity for a smooth algebraic curve X defined over k. We prove a non-Archimedean analogue of the equivalence between having negative Euler characteristic and the normality of certain families of analytic maps taking values in X.;math.AG
1801.02481;Combinatorial Proofs of Two Overpartition Theorems Connected by a Universal Mock Theta Function;In 2015, Bringmann, Lovejoy and Mahlburg considered certain kinds overpartitions, which can been seen as the overpartition analogue of Schur's partition. The motivation of their work is that the difference between the generating function of Schur's classical partitions and the generating functions of the partitions in which the smallest part is excluded. The difference between the two generating functions of partitions is a specialization of the "universal" mock theta function g_3 which introduced by Hickerson. To give an analogue of this, by using another universal mock theta function g_2 instead of g_3, Bringmann Lovejoy and Mahlburg introduced two kinds of overpartitions, which satisfy certain congruence conditions and difference conditions with the smallest parts different. They prove these theorems by using the q-differential equations. In this paper, we will give the generating functions of these two kinds of overpartitions by combinatorial technique.;math.CO
1801.02486;Tail Asymptotic Behavior of the supremum of a class of chi-square processes;In this paper, we analyze a multivariate counterpart of the generalized weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, which is the supremum of weighted locally stationary chi-square process over non-compact interval. The boundedness and the exact tail asymptotic behavior of the statistics are derived. <br />We illustrate our findings by two examples where the statistic is defined by Brownian bridge and fractional Brownian motion respectively.;math.PR
1801.02487;A Poincar&#x27,e-Hopf Type Formula for A Pair of Vector Fields;We extend the reslut about Poincar\'e-Hopf type formula for the difference of the Chern character numbers (cf.[3]) to the non-isolated singularities, and establish a Poincar\'e-Hopf type formula for a pair of vector field with the function $h^{T_{\mathbb{C}}M}(\cdot,\cdot)$ has non-isolated zero points over a closed, oriented smooth manifold of dimension $2n$.;math.DG
1801.02491;On Carlson&#x27,s Depth Conjecture;J.F. Carlson conjectured in 1995 that if G is a finite group and k is a field whose characteristic p divides the order of G that the depth of H*(G,k) equals the minimum of the dimensions of associated primes of H*(G,k). This is obviously true if H*(G,k) is Cohen-Macaulay and definitely false for arbitrary finitely generated k-algebras. It was shown by Carlson to be true if the dimension of H*(G,k) equals 2 and by D.J. Green to be true if the depth of H*(G,k) is equal to its possible minimum value, namely the maximum of the dimensions of elementary abelian p-groups contained in the center of G. In this paper we show the conjecture is true if dimension(H*(G,k))-depth(H*(G,k))=1. Known examples show the conjecture to be false for arbitrary finitely generated k-algebras satisfying this condition.;math.AC
1801.02493;Further results on the structure of (co)ends in finite tensor categories;Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a finite tensor category, and let $\mathcal{M}$ be an exact left $\mathcal{C}$-module category. The action of $\mathcal{C}$ on $\mathcal{M}$ induces a functor $\rho: \mathcal{C} \to \mathrm{Rex}(\mathcal{M})$, where $\mathrm{Rex}(\mathcal{M})$ is the category of $k$-linear right exact endofunctors on $\mathcal{M}$. Our key observation is that $\rho$ has a right adjoint $\rho^{\mathrm{ra}}$ given by the end $\rho^{\mathrm{ra}}(F) = \int_{M \in \mathcal{M}} \underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(M, M)$. As an application, we establish the following results: (1) We give a description of the composition of the induction functor $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{M}}^* \to \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{M}}^*)$ and Schauenburg's equivalence $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{M}}^*) \approx \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})$. (2) We introduce the space $\mathrm{CF}(\mathcal{M})$ of `class functions' of $\mathcal{M}$ and initiate the character theory for pivotal module categories. (3) We introduce a filtration for $\mathrm{CF}(\mathcal{M})$ and discuss its relation with some ring-theoretic notions, such as the Reynolds ideal and its generalizations. (4) We show that $\mathrm{Ext}_{\mathcal{C}}^{\bullet}(1, \rho^{\mathrm{ra}}(\mathrm{id}_{\mathcal{M}}))$ is isomorphic to the Hochschild cohomology of $\mathcal{M}$. As an application, we show that the modular group acts projectively on the Hochschild cohomology of a modular tensor category.;math.QA
1801.02494;On the Cauchy problem with large data for the space-dependent Boltzmann Nordheim equation III;This paper studies the quantum Boltzmann Nordheim equation from a Boltzmann equation for Haldane statistics. Strong solutions are obtained for the Cauchy problem with initial data in L1 and uniformly bounded on a one (resp. two or three)-dimensional torus for three-dimensional velocities and pseudo-Maxwellian (resp. very soft) forces. The main results are existence, uniqueness and stability of solutions conserving mass, momentum, and energy, with the uniform bound exploding if the solutions are only local in time.;math-ph
1801.02496;Cumulant Generating Function of Codeword Lengths in Variable-Length Lossy Compression Allowing Positive Excess Distortion Probability;This paper considers the problem of variable-length lossy source coding. The performance criteria are the excess distortion probability and the cumulant generating function of codeword lengths. We derive a non-asymptotic fundamental limit of the cumulant generating function of codeword lengths allowing positive excess distortion probability. It is shown that the achievability and converse bounds are characterized by the R\'enyi entropy-based quantity. In the proof of the achievability result, the explicit code construction is provided. Further, we investigate an asymptotic single-letter characterization of the fundamental limit for a stationary memoryless source.;cs.IT
1801.02497;Closures of locally divergent orbits of maximal tori and values of homogeneous forms;Let $\G$ be a semisimple algebraic group over a number field $K$, $\mathcal{S}$ a finite set of places of $K$, $K_\mathcal{S}$ the direct product of the completions $K_v, v \in \mathcal{S}$, and $\OO$ the ring of $\mathcal{S}$-integers of $K$. Let $G = \G(K_\mathcal{S})$, $\Gamma = \G(\OO)$ and $\pi:G \rightarrow G/\Gamma$ the quotient map. We describe the closures of the locally divergent orbits ${T\pi(g)}$ %in $G/\Gamma$ where $T$ is a maximal $K_\mathcal{S}$-split torus in $G$. If $\# S = 2$ then the closure $\overline{T\pi(g)}$ is a finite union of $T$-orbits stratified in terms of parabolic subgroups of $\G \times \G$ and, consequently, $\overline{T\pi(g)}$ is homogeneous (i.e., $\overline{T\pi(g)}= H\pi(g)$ for a subgroup $H$ of $G$) if and only if ${T\pi(g)}$ is closed. On the other hand, if $\# \mathcal{S} &gt, 2$ and $K$ is not a $\mathrm{CM}$-field then $\overline{T\pi(g)}$ is homogeneous for $\G = \mathbf{SL}_{n}$ and, generally, non-homogeneous but squeezed between closed orbits of two reductive subgroups of equal semisimple $K$-ranks for $\G \neq \mathbf{SL}_{n}$. As an application, we prove that $\overline{f(\OO^{n})} = K_{\mathcal{S}}$ for the class of non-rational locally $K$-decomposable homogeneous forms $f \in K_{\mathcal{S}}[x_1, \cdots, x_{n}]$.;math.DS
1801.02502;Optimal distributed control of two-dimensional nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes systems with degenerate mobility and singular potential;In this paper, we consider a two-dimensional diffuse interface model for the phase separation of an incompressible and isothermal binary fluid mixture with matched densities. This model consists of the Navier--Stokes equations, nonlinearly coupled with a convective nonlocal Cahn--Hilliard equation. The system rules the evolution of the volume-averaged velocity $\uvec$ of the mixture and the (relative) concentration difference $\varphi$ of the two phases. The aim of this work is to study an optimal control problem for such a system, the control being a time-dependent external force acting on the fluid. We first prove the existence of an optimal control for a given tracking type cost functional. Then we study the differentiability properties of the control-to-state map $\vvec \mapsto [\uvec,\varphi]$, and we establish first-order necessary optimality conditions. These results generalize the ones obtained by the first and the third authors jointly with E.~Rocca in [19]. There the authors assumed a constant mobility and a regular potential with polynomially controlled growth. Here, we analyze the physically more relevant case of a degenerate mobility and a singular (e.g., logarithmic) potential. This is made possible by the existence of a unique strong solution which was recently proved by the authors and C.\,G.~Gal in [14].;math.AP
1801.02504;On the consistency of adaptive multiple tests;Much effort has been done to control the "false discovery rate" (FDR) when $m$ hypotheses are tested simultaneously. The FDR is the expectation of the "false discovery proportion" $\text{FDP}=V/R$ given by the ratio of the number of false rejections $V$ and all rejections $R$. In this paper, we have a closer look at the FDP for adaptive linear step-up multiple tests. These tests extend the well known Benjamini and Hochberg test by estimating the unknown amount $m_0$ of the true null hypotheses. We give exact finite sample formulas for higher moments of the FDP and, in particular, for its variance. Using these allows us a precise discussion about the consistency of adaptive step-up tests. We present sufficient and necessary conditions for consistency on the estimators $\widehat m_0$ and the underlying probability regime. We apply our results to convex combinations of generalized Storey type estimators with various tuning parameters and (possibly) data-driven weights. The corresponding step-up tests allow a flexible adaptation. Moreover, these tests control the FDR at finite sample size. We compare these tests to the classical Benjamini and Hochberg test and discuss the advantages of it.;math.ST
1801.02505;Optimal Utility-Privacy Trade-off with Total Variation Distance as a Privacy Measure;The total variation distance is proposed as a privacy measure in an information disclosure scenario when the goal is to reveal some information about available data in return of utility, while retaining the privacy of certain sensitive latent variables from the legitimate receiver. The total variation distance is introduced as a measure of privacy-leakage by showing that: i) it satisfies the post-processing and linkage inequalities, which makes it consistent with an intuitive notion of a privacy measure, ii) the optimal utility-privacy trade-off can be solved through a standard linear program when total variation distance is employed as the privacy measure, iii) it provides a bound on the privacy-leakage measured by mutual information, maximal leakage, or the improvement in an inference attack with a bounded cost function.;cs.IT

Based on the representation of S-parameters when an anomaly exists, we design a direct sampling method (DSM) for imaging an anomaly and establishing a relationship between the indicator function of DSM and an infinite series of Bessel functions of integer order. Simulation results using synthetic data at f=1GHz of angular frequency are illustrated to support the identified structure of the indicator function.;math.NA
1801.02513;Genus zero Gopakumar-Vafa type invariants for Calabi-Yau 4-folds;In analogy with the Gopakumar-Vafa conjecture on CY 3-folds, Klemm and Pandharipande defined GV type invariants on Calabi-Yau 4-folds using Gromov-Witten theory and conjectured their integrality. In this paper, we propose a sheaf-theoretic interpretation of their genus zero invariants using Donaldson-Thomas theory on CY 4-folds. More specifically, we conjecture genus zero GV type invariants are $\mathrm{DT_{4}}$ invariants for one-dimensional stable sheaves on CY 4-folds. Some examples are computed for both compact and non-compact CY 4-folds to support our conjectures. We also propose an equivariant version of the conjectures for local curves and verify them in certain cases.;math.AG
1801.02515;Data-driven semi-parametric detection of multiple changes in long-range dependent processes;This paper is devoted to the offline multiple changes detection for long-range dependence processes. The observations are supposed to satisfy a semi-parametric long-range dependence assumption with distinct memory parameters on each stage. A penalized local Whittle contrast is considered for estimating all the parameters, notably the number of changes. The consistency as well as convergence rates are obtained. Monte-Carlo experiments exhibit the accuracy of the estimators. They also show that the estimation of the number of breaks is improved by using a data-driven slope heuristic procedure of choice of the penalization parameter.;math.ST
1801.02516;Detection of small inhomogeneities via direct sampling method in transverse electric polarization;Various studies have confirmed the possibility of identifying the location of a set of small inhomogeneities via a direct sampling method, however, when their permeability differs from that of the background, their location cannot be satisfactorily identified. However, no theoretical explanation for this phenomenon has been verified. In this study, we demonstrate that the indicator function of the direct sampling method can be expressed by the Bessel function of order one of the first kind and explain why the exact locations of inhomogeneities cannot be identified. Numerical results with noisy data are exhibited to support our examination.;math.NA
1801.02517;On the cofinality of the splitting number;The splitting number can be singular.

Math., 65, (1989);math.LO
1801.02519;Fano Kaleidoscopes and their generalizations;In this work we introduce Fano Kaleidoscopes, Hesse Kaleidoscopes and their generalizations. These are a particular kind of colored designs for which we will discuss general theory, present some constructions and prove existence results. In particular, using difference methods we show the existence of both a Fano and a Hesse Kaleidoscope on $v$ points when $v$ is a prime or prime power congruent to 1$\pmod{6}$, $v\ne13$. In the Fano case this, together with known results on pairwise balanced designs, allows us to prove the existence of Kaleidoscopes of order $v$ for many other values of $v$, we discuss what the situation is, on the other hand, in the Hesse and general case.;math.CO
1801.02520;On the Szeg&#x151, formulas for truncated Wiener-Hopf operators;We consider functions of multi-dimensional versions of truncated Wiener--Hopf operators with smooth symbols, and study the scaling asymptotics of their traces. The obtained results extend the asymptotic formulas obtained by H. Widom in the 1980's to non-smooth functions, and non-smooth truncation domains. The obtained asymptotic formulas are used to analyse the scaling limit of the spatially bipartite entanglement entropy of thermal equilibrium states of non-interacting fermions at positive temperature.;math.SP
1801.02521;Cohomological Property of Vector Bundles on Biprojective Spaces;This paper investigates the cohomological property of vector bundles on biprojective space.

1801.02523;Asymmetric tie-points and almost clopen subsets of N*;A tie-point of a compact space is analogous to a cut-point: the complement of the point falls apart into two relatively clopen non-compact subsets. Set-theoretically a tie-point of N* is an ultrafilter whose dual maximal ideal can be generated by the union of two non-principal mod finite orthogonal ideals. We review some of the many consistency results that have depended on the construction of tie-points of N*. One especially important application, due to Velickovic, was to the existence of non-trivial involutions on N*. A tie-point of N* has been called symmetric if it is the unique fixed point of an involution. We define the notion of an almost clopen set to be the closure of one of the proper relatively clopen subsets of the complement of a tie-point. We explore asymmetries of almost clopen subsets of N* in the sense of how may an almost clopen set differ from its natural complementary almost clopen set.;math.GN
1801.02525;Refined Tail Asymptotic Properties for the $M^X/G/1$ Retrial Queue;In the literature, retrial queues with batch arrivals and heavy service times have been studied and the so-called equivalence theorem has been established under the condition that the service time is heavier than the batch size. The equivalence theorem provides the distribution (or tail) equivalence between the total number of customers in the system for the retrial queue and the total number of customers in the corresponding standard (non-retrial) queue. In this paper, under the assumption of regularly varying tails, we eliminate this condition by allowing that the service time can be either heavier or lighter than the batch size. The main contribution made in this paper is an asymptotic characterization of the difference between two tail probabilities: the probability of the total number of customers in the system for the $M^X/G/1$ retrial queue and the probability of the total number of customers in the corresponding standard (non-retrial) queue. The equivalence theorem by allowing a heavier batch size is another contribution in this paper.;math.PR
1801.02526;Probing non-orthogonality of eigenvectors in non-Hermitian matrix models: diagrammatic approach;Using large $N$ arguments, we propose a scheme for calculating the two-point eigenvector correlation function for non-normal random matrices in the large $N$ limit. The setting generalizes the quaternionic extension of free probability to two-point functions. In the particular case of biunitarily invariant random matrices, we obtain a simple, general expression for the two-point eigenvector correlation function, which can be viewed as a further generalization of the single ring theorem. This construction has some striking similarities to the freeness of the second kind known for the Hermitian ensembles in large $N$. On the basis of several solved examples, we conjecture two kinds of microscopic universality of the eigenvectors - one in the bulk, and one at the rim. The form of the conjectured bulk universality agrees with the scaling limit found by Chalker and Mehlig [JT Chalker, B Mehlig, PRL, \textbf{81}, 3367 (1998)] in the case of the complex Ginibre ensemble.;math-ph
1801.02528;Positive solutions for a second order multi-point boundary value problem with delay;In this work, we investigate the existence of positive solutions for a multi-point boundary value problem for a second order delay differential equation. Under certain growth conditions on the nonlinearity, and by the mean of Leray-Schauder fixed point theorem, sufficient conditions for the existence of nontrivial solution are obtained, which improve the results of J. Chen et al. [3].;math.AP
1801.02529;Finitary coding for the sub-critical Ising model with finite expected coding volume;It has been shown by van den Berg and Steif that the sub-critical Ising model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is a finitary factor of a finite-valued i.i.d. process. We strengthen this by showing that the factor map can be made to have finite expected coding volume (in fact, stretched-exponential tails), answering a question of van den Berg and Steif. The result holds at any temperature above the critical temperature. An analogous result holds for Markov random fields satisfying a high-noise assumption and for proper colorings with a large number of colors.;math.PR
1801.02530;The local limit theorem on nilpotent Lie groups;A local limit theorem is proven on connected, simply connected nilpotent Lie groups, for a class of generating measures satisfying a moment condition and a condition on the characteristic function of the abelianization. The result extends an earlier local limit theorems of Alexopoulos which treated absolutely continuous measures with a continuous density of compact support, and also extends local limit theorems of Breuillard and Diaconis-Hough which treated general measures on the Heisenberg group.;math.PR
1801.02532;On the Discrepancy Between Two Zagreb Indices;We examine the quantity \[S(G) = \sum_{uv\in E(G)} \min(\text{deg } u, \text{deg } v)\] over sets of graphs with a fixed number of edges. The main result shows the maximum possible value of $S(G)$ is achieved by three different classes of constructions, depending on the distance between the number of edges and the nearest triangular number. Furthermore we determine the maximum possible value when the set of graphs is restricted to be bipartite, a forest or to be planar given sufficiently many edges. The quantity $S(G)$ corresponds to the difference between two well studied indices, the irregularity of a graph and the sum of the squares of the degrees in a graph. These are known as the first and third Zagreb indices in the area of mathematical chemistry.;math.CO
1801.02538;Equivalence of the Rothberger and $2$-Rothberger Games for Hausdorff Spaces;We prove that in any Hausdorff space, the Rothberger game is equivalent to the $k$-Rothberger game, i.e. the game in which player II chooses $k$ open sets in each move. This result follows from a more general theorem in which we show these games are equivalent to a game we call the restricted Menger game. In this game I knows immediately in advance of playing each open cover how many open sets II will choose from that open cover. This result illuminates the relationship between the Rothberger and Menger games in Hausdorff spaces. The equivalence of these games answers a question posed by Aurichi, Bella, and Dias, at least in the context of Hausdorff spaces.;math.GN
1801.02539;Bayesian estimation of a decreasing density;Suppose $X_1,\dots, X_n$ is a random sample from a bounded and decreasing density $f_0$ on $[0,\infty)$. We are interested in estimating such $f_0$, with special interest in $f_0(0)$. This problem is encountered in various statistical applications and has gained quite some attention in the statistical literature. It is well known that the maximum likelihood estimator is inconsistent at zero. This has led several authors to propose alternative estimators which are consistent. As any decreasing density can be represented as a scale mixture of uniform densities, a Bayesian estimator is obtained by endowing the mixture distribution with the Dirichlet process prior. Assuming this prior, we derive contraction rates of the posterior density at zero by carefully revising arguments presented in Salomond (2014). Various methods for estimating the density are compared using a simulation study. We apply the Bayesian procedure to the current durations data described in Keiding et al.(2012).;math.ST
1801.02545;Quasiregular semigroups with examples;Rational semigroups were introduced by Hinkkanen and Martin as a generalization of the iteration of a single rational map. There has subsequently been much interest in the study of rational semigroups. Quasiregular semigroups were introduced shortly after rational semigroups as analogues in higher real dimensions, but have received far less attention. Each map in a quasiregular semigroup must necessarily be a uniformly quasiregular map. While there is a completely viable theory for the iteration of uniformly quasiregular maps, it is a highly non-trivial matter to construct them. In this paper, we study properties of the Julia and Fatou sets of quasiregular semigroups and, equally as importantly, give several families of examples illustrating some of the behaviours that can arise.;math.DS
1801.02553;Gaussian 1-2-1 Networks: Capacity Results for mmWave Communications;This paper proposes a new model for wireless relay networks referred to as "1-2-1 network", where two nodes can communicate only if they point "beams" at each other, while if they do not point beams at each other, no signal can be exchanged or interference can be generated. This model is motivated by millimeter wave communications where, due to the high path loss, a link between two nodes can exist only if beamforming gain at both sides is established, while in the absence of beamforming gain the signal is received well below the thermal noise floor. The main result in this paper is that the 1-2-1 network capacity can be approximated by routing information along at most $2N+2$ paths, where $N$ is the number of relays connecting a source and a destination through an arbitrary topology.;cs.IT
1801.02561;Flux reconstructions in the Lehmann-Goerisch method for lower bounds on eigenvalues;The standard application of the Lehmann-Goerisch method for lower bounds on eigenvalues of symmetric elliptic second-order partial differential operators relies on determination of fluxes $\sigma_i$ that approximate co-gradients of exact eigenfunctions scaled by corresponding eigenvalues. Fluxes $\sigma_i$ are usually computed by a global saddle point problem solved by mixed finite element methods. In this paper we propose a simpler global problem that yields fluxes $\sigma_i$ of the same quality. The simplified problem is smaller, it is positive definite, and any $H(\mathrm{div},\Omega)$ conforming finite elements, such as Raviart-Thomas elements, can be used for its solution. In addition, these global problems can be split into a number of independent local problems on patches, which allows for trivial parallelization. The computational performance of these approaches is illustrated by numerical examples for Laplace and Steklov type eigenvalue problems. These examples also show that local flux reconstructions enable to compute lower bounds on eigenvalues on considerably finer meshes than the traditional global reconstructions.;math.NA
1801.02562;Vanishing theorems for parabolic Higgs bundles;This is a sequel to "Kodaira-Saito vanishing via Higgs bundles in positive characteristic" (<a href="/abs/1611.09880">arXiv:1611.09880</a>). However, unlike the previous paper, all the arguments here are in characteristic zero. The main result is a Kodaira vanishing theorem for semistable parabolic Higgs bundles with trivial parabolic Chern classes. This implies a general semipositivity theorem. This also implies a Kodaira-Saito vanishing theorem for complex variations of Hodge structure.;math.AG
1801.02563;Information Theoretic Security for Side-Channel Attacks to the Shannon Cipher System;We study side-channel attacks for the Shannon cipher system. To pose side channel-attacks to the Shannon cipher system, we regard them as a signal estimation via encoded data from two distributed sensors. This can be formulated as the one helper source coding problem posed and investigated by Ahlswede, K\"orner(1975), and Wyner(1975). We further investigate the posed problem to derive new secrecy bounds. Our results are derived by a coupling of the result Watanabe and Oohama(2012) obtained on bounded storage evasdropper with the exponential strong converse theorem Oohama(2015) established for the one helper source coding problem.;cs.IT
1801.02564;Sampling Almost Periodic and related Functions;We consider certain finite sets of circle-valued functions defined on intervals of real numbers and estimate how large the intervals must be for the values of these functions to be uniformly distributed in an approximate way. <br />This is used to establish some general conditions under which a random construction introduced by Katznelson for the integers yields sets that are dense in the Bohr group. We obtain in this way very sparse sets of real numbers (and of integers) on which two different almost periodic functions cannot agree, what makes them amenable to be used in sampling theorems for these functions. These sets can be made as sparse as to have zero asymptotic density or as to be t-sets, i.e., to be sets that intersect any of their translates in a bounded set. Many of these results are proved not only for almost periodic functions but also for classes of functions generated by more general complex exponential functions, including chirps.;math.FA
1801.02566;Equivalences between learning of data and probability distributions, and their applications;Algorithmic learning theory traditionally studies the learnability of effective infinite binary sequences (reals), while recent work by [Vitanyi and Chater, 2017] and [Bienvenu et al., 2014] has adapted this framework to the study of learnability of effective probability distributions from random data. We prove that for certain families of probability measures that are parametrized by reals, learnability of a subclass of probability measures is equivalent to learnability of the class of the corresponding real parameters. This equivalence allows to transfer results from classical algorithmic theory to learning theory of probability measures. We present a number of such applications, providing many new results regarding EX and BC learnability of classes of measures, thus drawing parallels between the two learning theories.;math.LO
1801.02572;Gaps in the spectrum of a cuboidal periodic lattice graph;We locate gaps in the spectrum of a Hamiltonian on a periodic cuboidal (and generally hyperrectangular) lattice graph with $\delta$ couplings in the vertices. We formulate sufficient conditions under which the number of gaps is finite. As the main result, we find a connection between the arrangement of the gaps and the coefficients in a continued fraction associated with the ratio of edge lengths of the lattice. This knowledge enables a straightforward construction of a periodic quantum graph with any required number of spectral gaps and---to some degree---to control their positions, i.e., to partially solve the inverse spectral problem.;math-ph

1801.02585;Khovanov homology and binary dihedral representations for marked links;We introduce a version of Khovanov homology for alternating links with marking data, $\omega$, inspired by instanton theory. We show that the analogue of the spectral sequence from Khovanov homology to singular instanton homology introduced in \cite{KM_unknot} for this marked Khovanov homology collapses on the $E_2$ page for alternating links. We moreover show that for non-split links the Khovanov homology we introduce for alternating links does not depend on $\omega$, thus, the instanton homology also does not depend on $\omega$ for non-split alternating links. <br />Finally, we study a version of binary dihedral representations for links with markings, and show that for links of non-zero determinant, this also does not depend on $\omega$.;math.GT
1801.02587;Quenched phantom distribution functions for Markov chains;It is known that random walk Metropolis algorithms with heavy-tailed target densities can model atypical (slow) growth of maxima, which in general is exhibited by processes with the extremal index zero. The asymptotics of maxima of such sequences can be analyzed in terms of continuous phantom distribution functions. We show that in a large class of positive Harris recurrent Markov chains (containing the above Metropolis chains) a phantom distribution function can be recovered by starting "at the point" rather than from the stationary distribution.;math.PR
1801.02590;Number and Stability of Relaxation Oscillations for Predator-Prey Systems with Small Death Rates;We consider planar systems of predator-prey models with small predator death rate $\epsilon&gt,0$. Using geometric singular perturbation theory and Floquet theory, we derive characteristic functions that determines the location and the stability of relaxation oscillations as $\epsilon\to 0$. When the prey-isocline has a single interior local extremum, we prove that the system has a unique nontrivial periodic orbit, which forms a relaxation oscillation. For some systems with prey-isocline possessing two interior local extrema, we show that either the positive equilibrium is globally stable, or the system has exact two periodic orbits. In particular, for a predator-prey model with the Holling type IV functional response we derive a threshold value of the carrying capacity that separates these two outcomes. This result supports the so-called paradox of enrichment.;math.CA
1801.02594;Utility Optimal Scheduling for Coded Caching in General Topologies;We consider coded caching over the fading broadcast channel, where the users, equipped with a memory of finite size, experience asymmetric fading statistics. It is known that a naive application of coded caching over the channel at hand performs poorly especially in the regime of a large number of users due to a vanishing multicast rate. We overcome this detrimental effect by a careful design of opportunistic scheduling policies such that some utility function of the long-term average rates should be maximized while balancing fairness among users. In particular, we propose a threshold-based scheduling that requires only statistical channel state information and one-bit feedback from each user. More specifically, each user indicates via feedback whenever its SNR is above a threshold determined solely by the fading statistics and the fairness requirement. Surprisingly, we prove that this simple scheme achieves the optimal utility in the regime of a large number of users. Numerical examples show that our proposed scheme performs closely to the scheduling with full channel state information, but at a significantly reduced complexity.;cs.IT

The third puzzle is: are quantum computers possible?;math.CO
1801.02611;Spin Conductance and Spin Conductivity in Topological Insulators: Analysis of Kubo-like terms;We investigate spin transport in 2-dimensional insulators, with the long-term goal of establishing whether any of the transport coefficients corresponds to the Fu-Kane-Mele index which characterizes 2d time-reversal-symmetric topological insulators. Inspired by the Kubo theory of charge transport, and by using a proper definition of the spin current operator, we define the Kubo-like spin conductance $G_K^{s_z}$ and spin conductivity $\sigma_K^{s_z}$. We prove that for any gapped, periodic, near-sighted discrete Hamiltonian, the above quantities are mathematically well-defined and the equality $G_K^{s_z} = \sigma_K^{s_z}$ holds true. Moreover, we argue that the physically relevant condition to obtain the equality above is the vanishing of the mesoscopic average of the spin-torque response, which holds true under our hypotheses on the Hamiltonian operator. This vanishing condition might be relevant in view of further extensions of the result, e.g. to ergodic random discrete Hamiltonians or to Schr\"odinger operators on the continuum. A central role in the proof is played by the trace per unit volume and by two generalizations of the trace, the principal value trace and it directional version.;math-ph
1801.02644;On monomial ideals and their socles;For a finite subset $M\subset [x_1,\ldots,x_d]$ of monomials, we describe how to constructively obtain a monomial ideal $I\subseteq R = K[x_1,\ldots,x_d]$ such that the set of monomials in $\text{Soc}(I)\setminus I$ is precisely $M$, or such that $\overline{M}\subseteq R/I$ is a $K$-basis for the the socle of $R/I$. For a given $M$ we obtain a natural class of monomials $I$ with this property. This is done by using solely the lattice structure of the monoid $[x_1,\ldots,x_d]$. We then present some duality results by using anti-isomorphisms between upsets and downsets of $(\mathbb Z^d,\preceq)$. Finally, we define and analyze zero-dimensional monomial ideals of $R$ of type $k$, where type $1$ are exactly the Artinian Gorenstein ideals, and describe the structure of such ideals that correspond to order-generic antichains in $\mathbb Z^d$.;math.AC
1801.02646;Exploiting random lead times for significant inventory cost savings;We study the classical single-item inventory system in which unsatisfied demands are backlogged. Replenishment lead times are random, independent identically distributed, causing orders to cross in time. We develop a new inventory policy to exploit implications of lead time randomness and order crossover, and evaluate its performance by asymptotic analysis and simulations. Our policy does not follow the basic principle of Constant Base Stock (CBS) policy, or more generally, (s,S) and (r,Q) policies, which is to keep the inventory position within a fixed range. Instead, it uses the current inventory level (= inventory-on-hand minus backlog) to set a dynamic target for inventory in-transit, and place orders to follow this target. Our policy includes CBS policy as a special case, under a particular choice of a policy parameter. We show that our policy can significantly reduce the average inventory cost compared with CBS policy. Specifically, we prove that if the lead time is exponentially distributed, then under our policy, with properly chosen policy parameters, the expected (absolute) inventory level scales as $o(\sqrt{r})$, as the demand rate $r\to\infty$. In comparison, it is known to scale as $\Theta(\sqrt{r})$ under CBS policy. In particular, this means that, as $r\to\infty$, the average inventory cost under our policy vanishes in comparison with that under CBS policy. Furthermore, our simulations show that the advantage of our policy remains to be substantial under non-exponential lead time distributions, and may even be greater than under exponential distribution. We also use simulations to compare GBS to an optimal policy for some cases where computing the optimal cost is tractable. The results show that our policy removes a majority of excess costs of CBS policy over the minimum cost, leading to much smaller optimality gaps.;math.PR
1801.02650;Higher order recurrences and row sequences of Hermite-Pad&#xe9, approximation;We obtain extensions of the Poincar\'e and Perron theorems for higher order recurrence relations and apply them to obtain an inverse type theorem for row sequences of (type II) Hermite-Pad\'e approximation of a vector of formal power series.;math.CV
1801.02654;Quiddity sequences for $\mathrm{SL}_3$-frieze patterns;The notion of a $(k,n)$-frieze pattern was introduced by the author as a generalisation of the classical frieze patterns. In this article we describe connections between classes of $(3,n)$-frieze patterns and classes of $\mathrm{SL}_3$-frieze patterns. We introduce the idea of a superimposed triangulation and clarify how superimposed triangulations may be used to understand quiddity sequences for $\mathrm{SL}_3$-frieze patterns.;math.CO
1801.02662;Tensor network ranks;In problems involving approximation, completion, denoising, dimension reduction, estimation, interpolation, modeling, order reduction, regression, etc, we argue that the near-universal practice of assuming that a function, matrix, or tensor (which we will see are all the same object in this context) has \emph{low rank} may be ill-justified. There are many natural instances where the object in question has high rank with respect to the classical notions of rank: matrix rank, tensor rank, multilinear rank --- the latter two being the most straightforward generalizations of the former. To remedy this, we show that one may vastly expand these classical notions of ranks: Given any undirected graph $G$, there is a notion of $G$-rank associated with $G$, which provides us with as many different kinds of ranks as there are undirected graphs. In particular, the popular tensor network states in physics (e.g., \textsc{mps}, \textsc{ttns}, \textsc{peps}) may be regarded as functions of a specific $G$-rank for various choices of $G$. Among other things, we will see that a function, matrix, or tensor may have very high matrix, tensor, or multilinear rank and yet very low $G$-rank for some $G$. In fact the difference is in the orders of magnitudes and the gaps between $G$-ranks and these classical ranks are arbitrarily large for some important objects in computer science, mathematics, and physics. Furthermore, we show that there is a $G$ such that almost every tensor has $G$-rank exponentially lower than its rank or the dimension of its ambient space.;math.NA
1801.02675;Wulff shapes and a characterization of simplices via a Bezout type inequality;Inspired by a fundamental theorem of Bernstein, Kushnirenko, and Khovanskii we study the following Bezout type inequality for mixed volumes $$ V(L_1,\dots,L_{n})V_n(K)\leq V(L_1,K[{n-1}])V(L_2,\dots, L_{n},K). $$ We show that the above inequality characterizes simplices, i.e. if $K$ is a convex body satisfying the inequality for all convex bodies $L_1, \dots, L_n \subset {\mathbb R}^n$, then $K$ must be an $n$-dimensional simplex. The main idea of the proof is to study perturbations given by Wulff shapes. In particular, we prove a new theorem on differentiability of the support function of the Wulff shape, which is of independent interest. <br />In addition, we study the Bezout inequality for mixed volumes introduced in <a href="/abs/1507.00765">arXiv:1507.00765</a> . We introduce the class of weakly decomposable convex bodies which is strictly larger than the set of all polytopes that are non-simplices.

1801.02679;Graph-Based Radio Resource Management for Vehicular Networks;This paper investigates the resource allocation problem in device-to-device (D2D)-based vehicular communications, based on slow fading statistics of channel state information (CSI), to alleviate signaling overhead for reporting rapidly varying accurate CSI of mobile links. We consider the case when each vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) link shares spectrum with multiple vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links. Leveraging the slow fading statistical CSI of mobile links, we maximize the sum V2I capacity while guaranteeing the reliability of all V2V links. We propose a graph-based algorithm that uses graph partitioning tools to divide highly interfering V2V links into different clusters before formulating the spectrum sharing problem as a weighted 3-dimensional matching problem, which is then solved through adapting a high-performance approximation algorithm.;cs.IT

1801.02688;Joint Resource Allocation and Antenna Selection In the Uplink of OFDMA Networks;The problem of joint sub-channel, power control and antenna selection in the uplink of OFDMA networks is investigated. The corresponding optimization problem is a non convex mixed integer non-linear problem(MINLP). To tackle the problem, an iterative two-step optimization problem is devised. First,~Having fixed the selected antenna as well as the associated power of each user,~a sub-channel assignment problem using the so-called Hungarian method is proposed. Second, the joint power and antenna selection problem is extended into a more elegant form through adding a penalty term to the objective function forcing the relaxed boolean variables associated with antenna selection problem to take binary values. To this end, the problem is restated as a difference of two concave function (DC programming) and is effectively solved in an iterative manner. The foregoing procedure is iteratively repeated until approaching a fixed network throughput. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method w.r.t. the exhaustive search with fixed power control mechanism.;cs.IT
1801.02692;L-spaces, left-orderability and two-bridge knots;We show that the 3-fold cyclic branched cover of any genus 2 two-bridge knot $K_{[-2q,2s,-2t,2l]}$ is an L-space and its fundamental group is not left-orderable. Therefore the family of 3-fold cyclic branched cover of any genus 2 two-bridge knot $K_{[-2q,2s,-2t,2l]}$ verifies the $L$-space conjecture. We also show that if $K_{[2k,-2l]}$ is a 2-bridge knot with $k\geq 2$, $l&gt,0$, then the fundamental group of the 5-fold cyclic branched cover of $K_{[2k,-2l]}$ is not left-orderable, which will complete the proof that the fundamental group of the 5-fold cyclic branched cover of any genus one two-bridge knot is not left-orderable.;math.GT

1801.02700;Mass-structure of weighted real trees;Rooted, weighted continuum random trees are used to describe limits of sequences of random discrete trees. Formally, they are random quadruples $(\mathcal{T},d,r,p)$, where $(\mathcal{T},d)$ is a tree-like metric space, $r\in\mathcal{T}$ is a distinguished root, and $p$ is a probability measure on this space. The underlying branching structure is carried implicitly in the metric $d$. We explore various ways of describing the interaction between branching structure and mass in $(\mathcal{T},d,r,p)$ in a way that depends on $d$ only by way of this branching structure. We introduce a notion of mass-structure equivalence and show that two rooted, weighted $\mathbb{R}$-trees are equivalent in this sense if and only if the discrete hierarchies derived by i.i.d. sampling from their weights, in a manner analogous to Kingman's paintbox, have the same distribution. We introduce a family of trees, called "interval partition trees" that serve as representatives of mass-structure equivalence classes, and which naturally represent the laws of the aforementioned hierarchies.;math.PR
1801.02701;Novel Impossibility Results for Group-Testing;In this work we prove non-trivial impossibility results for perhaps the simplest non-linear estimation problem, that of {\it Group Testing} (GT), via the recently developed Madiman-Tetali inequalities. Group Testing concerns itself with identifying a hidden set of $d$ defective items from a set of $n$ items via $t$ {disjunctive/pooled} measurements ("group tests"). We consider the linear sparsity regime, i.e. $d = \delta n$ for any constant $\delta &gt,0$, a hitherto little-explored (though natural) regime. In a standard information-theoretic setting, where the tests are required to be non-adaptive and a small probability of reconstruction error is allowed, our lower bounds on $t$ are the {\it first} that improve over the classical counting lower bound, $t/n \geq H(\delta)$, where $H(\cdot)$ is the binary entropy function. As corollaries of our result, we show that (i) for $\delta \gtrsim 0.347$, individual testing is essentially optimal, i.e., $t \geq n(1-o(1))$, and (ii) there is an {adaptivity gap}, since for $\delta \in (0.3471,0.3819)$ known {adaptive} GT algorithms require fewer than $n$ tests to reconstruct ${\cal D}$, whereas our bounds imply that the best nonadaptive algorithm must essentially be individual testing of each element. Perhaps most importantly, our work provides a framework for combining combinatorial and information-theoretic methods for deriving non-trivial lower bounds for a variety of non-linear estimation problems.;cs.IT
1801.02709;Derived categories and the genus of space curves;We generalize a classical result about the genus of curves in projective space by Gruson and Peskine to principally polarized abelian threefolds of Picard rank one. The proof is based on wall-crossing techniques for ideal sheaves of curves in the derived category. In the process, we obtain bounds for Chern characters of other stable objects such as rank two sheaves. The argument gives a proof for projective space as well. In this case these techniques also indicate an approach for a conjecture by Hartshorne and Hirschowitz and we prove first steps towards it.;math.AG
1801.02713;Duality of Channel Encoding and Decoding - Part II: Rate-1 Non-binary Convolutional Codes;This is the second part of a series of papers on a revisit to the bidirectional Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) soft-in-soft-out (SISO) maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) decoding algorithm. Part I revisited the BCJR MAP decoding algorithm for rate-1 binary convolutional codes and proposed a linear complexity decoder using shift registers in the complex number field. Part II proposes a low complexity decoder for rate-1 non-binary convolutional codes that achieves the same error performance as the bidirectional BCJR SISO MAP decoding algorithm. We observe an explicit relationship between the encoding and decoding of rate-1 convolutional codes in $GF(q)$. Based on this relationship, the BCJR forward and backward decoding are implemented by dual encoders using shift registers whose contents are vectors of complex numbers. The input to the dual encoders is the probability mass function (pmf) of the received symbols and the output of the dual encoders is the pmf of the information symbols. The bidirectional BCJR MAP decoding is implemented by linearly combining the shift register contents of the dual encoders for forward and backward decoding. The proposed decoder significantly reduces the computational complexity of the bidirectional BCJR MAP algorithm from exponential to linear with constraint length of convolutional codes. To further reduce complexity, fast Fourier transform (FFT) is applied. Mathematical proofs and simulation results are provided to validate our proposed decoder.;cs.IT

1801.02726;Near Maximum Likelihood Decoding with Deep Learning;A novel and efficient neural decoder algorithm is proposed. The proposed decoder is based on the neural Belief Propagation algorithm and the Automorphism Group. By combining neural belief propagation with permutations from the Automorphism Group we achieve near maximum likelihood performance for High Density Parity Check codes. Moreover, the proposed decoder significantly improves the decoding complexity, compared to our earlier work on the topic. We also investigate the training process and show how it can be accelerated. Simulations of the hessian and the condition number show why the learning process is accelerated. We demonstrate the decoding algorithm for various linear block codes of length up to 63 bits.;cs.IT
1801.02735;Gradient Method in Hilbert-Besov Spaces for the Optimal Control of Parabolic Free Boundary Problems;This paper presents computational analysis of the inverse Stefan type free boundary problem, where information on the boundary heat flux is missing and must be found along with the temperature and the free boundary. We pursue optimal control framework introduced in {\it U.G. Abdulla, Inverse Problems and Imaging, 7, 2(2013), 307-340,\ 10, 4(2016), 869--898}, where boundary heat flux and free boundary are components of the control vector, and optimality criteria consist of the minimization of the quadratic declinations from the available measurements of the temperature distribution at the final moment, phase transition temperature on the free boundary, and the final position of the free boundary. We develop gradient descent algorithm based on Frechet differentiability in Hilbert-Besov spaces complemented with preconditioning or increase of regularity of the Frechet gradient through implementation of the Riesz representation theorem. Three model examples with various levels of complexity are considered. Extensive comparative analysis through implementation of preconditioning and Tikhonov regularization, calibration of preconditioning and regularization parameters, effect of noisy data, comparison of simultaneous identification of control parameters vs. nested optimization is pursued.;math.OC
1801.02743;Enhancing Performance of Random Caching in Large-Scale Wireless Networks with Multiple Receive Antennas;To improve signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and make better use of file diversity provided by random caching, we consider two types of linear receivers, i.e., maximal ratio combining (MRC) receiver and partial zero forcing (PZF) receiver, at users in a large-scale cache-enabled single-input multi-output (SIMO) network. First, for each receiver, by utilizing tools from stochastic geometry, we derive a tractable expression and a tight upper bound for the successful transmission probability (STP). In the case of the MRC receiver, we also derive a closed-form expression for the asymptotic outage probability in the low SIR threshold regime. Then, for each receiver, we maximize the STP. In the case of the MRC receiver, we consider the maximization of the tight upper bound on the STP by optimizing the caching distribution, which is a non-convex problem. We obtain a stationary point, by solving an equivalent difference of convex (DC) programming problem using concave-convex procedure (CCCP). We also obtain a closed-form asymptotically optimal solution in the low SIR threshold regime. In the case of the PZF receiver, we consider the maximization of the tight upper bound on the STP by optimizing the caching distribution and the degrees of freedom (DoF) allocation (for boosting the signal power), which is a mixed discrete-continuous problem. Based on structural properties, we obtain a low-complexity near optimal solution by using an alternating optimization approach. The analysis and optimization results reveal the impact of antenna resource at users on random caching. Finally, by numerical results, we show that the random caching design with the PZF receiver achieves significant performance gains over the random caching design with the MRC receiver and some baseline caching designs.;cs.IT
1801.02745;Structural Results and Improved Upper Bounds on the Capacity of the Discrete-Time Poisson Channel;New capacity upper bounds are presented for the discrete-time Poisson channel with no dark current and an average-power constraint. These bounds are a simple consequence of techniques developed for the seemingly unrelated problem of upper bounding the capacity of binary deletion and repetition channels. Previously, the best known capacity upper bound in the regime where the average-power constraint does not approach zero was due to Martinez (JOSA B, 2007), which is re-derived as a special case of the framework developed in this paper. Furthermore, this framework is carefully instantiated in order to obtain a closed-form bound that noticeably improves the result of Martinez everywhere. Finally, capacity-achieving distributions for the discrete-time Poisson channel are studied under an average-power constraint and/or a peak-power constraint and arbitrary dark current. In particular, it is shown that the support of the capacity-achieving distribution under an average-power constraint only must be countably infinite. This settles a conjecture of Shamai (IEE Proceedings I, 1990) in the affirmative. Previously, it was only known that the support must be unbounded.;cs.IT

1801.02749;Degenerations and Lagrangian fibrations of Calabi-Yau manifolds;We discuss various topics on degenerations and special Lagrangian torus fibrations of Calabi-Yau manifolds in the context of mirror symmetry. A particular emphasis is on Tyurin degenerations and the Doran-Harder-Thompson conjecture, which builds a bridge between mirror symmetry for Calabi-Yau manifolds and that for quasi-Fano manifolds. The proof of the conjecture is of interest in its own right and leads us to a few other related topics such as SYZ mirror symmetry, theta functions and geometric quantization. Inspired by the conjecture, we also propose a new construction of Landau-Ginzburg models by splitting Calabi-Yau fibrations.;math.AG
1801.02751;A minimal closed-form solution to the conic based on self-polar triangle;In this paper, we use the properties of the self-polar triangle to not only show a novel method for a basic point-line enumerative problem of conics, but also present a series of closed-form solutions to the conics from all minimal configurations of points and lines in general position. These closed-form formulae may allow us to derive easily the algebraic and geometric conditions which characterize when the obtained conic is real and non-degenerate, so we propose a criterion for a non-degenerate real conic from each of all minimal configurations. The correctness of our results is validated by some examples.;math.AG
1801.02752;Equilibrium problems on Riemannian manifolds with applications;We study the equilibrium problem on general Riemannian manifolds. The results on existence of solutions and on the convex structure of the solution set are established. Our approach consists in relating the equilibrium problem to a suitable variational inequality problem on Riemannian manifolds, and is completely different from previous ones on this topic in the literature. As applications, the corresponding results for the mixed variational inequality and the Nash equilibrium are obtained. Moreover, we formulate and analyze the convergence of the proximal point algorithm for the equilibrium problem. In particular, correct proofs are provided for the results claimed in J. Math. Anal. Appl. 388, 61-77, 2012 (i.e., Theorems 3.5 and 4.9 there) regarding the existence of the mixed variational inequality and the domain of the resolvent for the equilibrium problem on Hadamard manifolds.;math.OC

1801.02758;On Two Dimensional Semi-Local Noetherian Spectra;In this article, we develop a technique to "split" certain types of partially ordered sets into simpler ones and use that technique to give a partial answer to a conjecture by R. Wiegand and S. Wiegand on the structure of semi-local, two-dimensional Noetherian spectra in their exposition on Noetherian prime ideals. Specifically, we show that very many two-dimensional posets with finitely many height two nodes that satisfy the necessary conditions of being the spectrum of a Noetherian ring, along with a very mild cardinality assumption, are in fact the spectrum of a Noetherian ring.;math.AC
1801.02759;An iteration regularizaion method with general convex penalty for nonlinear inverse problems in Banach spaces;In this paper, we discuss the construction, analysis and implementation of a novel iterative regularization scheme with general convex penalty term for nonlinear inverse problems in Banach spaces based on the homotopy perturbation technique, in an attempt to detect the special features of the sought solutions such as sparsity or piecewise constant. By using tools from convex analysis in Banach spaces, we provide a detailed convergence and stability results for the presented algorithm. Numerical simulations for one-dimensional and two-dimensional parameter identification problems are performed to validate that our approach is competitive in terms of reducing the overall computational time in comparison with the existing Landweber iteration with general convex penalty.;math.NA
1801.02761;An analytical proof for synchronization of stochastic phase oscillator;In this paper, we show that under a generic condition of the coefficient of a stochastic phase oscillator the Lyapunov exponent of the linearization along an arbitrary solution is always negative.

1801.02763;Homogeneous contact manifolds and resolutions of Calabi-Yau cones;In the present work we provide a constructive method to describe contact structures on compact homogeneous contact manifolds. The main feature of our approach is to describe the Cartan-Ehresmann connection (gauge field) for principal circle bundles over complex flag manifolds by using elements of representation theory of simple Lie algebras. This description allows us to compute explicitly the expression of the contact form for any Boothby-Wang fibration over complex flag manifolds as well as their induced homogeneous Sasaki-Einstein structures. As an application of our results we use the Cartan-Remmert reduction and the Calabi ansatz technique to provide many explicit examples of crepant resolutions of Calabi-Yau cones with certain homogeneous Sasaki-Einstein manifolds realized as links of isolated hypersurface singularities.;math.DG

1801.02767;Decompositions and measures on countable Borel equivalence relations;We show that the uniform measure-theoretic ergodic decomposition of a countable Borel equivalence relation $(X, E)$ may be realized as the topological ergodic decomposition of a continuous action of a countable group $\Gamma \curvearrowright X$ generating $E$. We then apply this to the study of the cardinal algebra $\mathcal K(E)$ of equidecomposition types of Borel sets with respect to a compressible countable Borel equivalence relation $(X, E)$. We also make some general observations regarding quotient topologies on topological ergodic decompositions, with an application to weak equivalence of measure-preserving actions.;math.LO
1801.02772;Restricted sum formula for finite and symmetric multiple zeta values;The sum formula for finite and symmetric multiple zeta values, established by Wakabayashi and the authors, implies that if the weight and depth are fixed and the specified component is required to be more than one, then the values sum up to a rational multiple of the analogue of the Riemann zeta value. We prove that the result remains true if we further demand that the component should be more than two or that another component should also be more than one.;math.NT
1801.02775;Bousfield localisation and colocalisation of one-dimensional model structures;We give an account of Bousfield localisation and colocalisation for one-dimensional model categories---ones enriched over the model category of $0$-types. A distinguishing feature of our treatment is that it builds localisations and colocalisations using only the constructions of projective and injective transfer of model structures along right and left adjoint functors, and without any reference to Smith's theorem.;math.CT
1801.02777;Nonlocal equations with regular varying decay solutions;We study the asymptotic behavior for nonlocal diffusion equations $\partial_tu=\mathcal{J}u-\chi_0u$ in $\mathbb{R}^n\times(0,\infty)$ and obtain a sufficient condition so that solutions of the Cauchy problem decay in time at the rate of a regular varying function. In the sufficient condition, a sharp bound of certain forms is required for the $k$-fold iterations $\mathcal{J}^ku_0$ or the kernels $J_k$. We prove the desired decay rate by analyzing the asymptotic behavior of a regular varying modified exponential series. Then we verify that the sufficient condition is true for most of the known radially symmetric kernels, and for some more general kernels, using the sharp Young's convolution inequality and a Fourier splitting argument. Classical results on the decay of solutions for these nonlocal diffusion equations are re-established and generalized. Finally, using our framework, we can exhibit a kernel having a prescribed regular varying decay solutions for a wide class of regular varying functions.;math.AP
1801.02779;Quantum walks with an anisotropic coin II: scattering theory;We perform the scattering analysis of the evolution operator of quantum walks with an anisotropic coin, and we prove a weak limit theorem for their asymptotic velocity. The quantum walks that we consider include one-defect models, two-phase quantum walks, and topological phase quantum walks as special cases. Our analysis is based on an abstract framework for the scattering theory of unitary operators in a two-Hilbert spaces setting, which is of independent interest.;math-ph
1801.02781;Minimum Throughput Maximization in UAV-Aided Wireless Powered Communication Networks;This paper investigates unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided wireless powered communication network (WPCN) systems where a mobile access point (AP) at the UAV serves multiple energy-constrained ground terminals (GTs). Specifically, the UAVs first charge the GTs by transmitting the wireless energy transfer (WET) signals in the downlink. Then, by utilizing the harvested wireless energy from the UAVs, the GTs send their uplink wireless information transmission (WIT) signals to the UAVs. In this paper, depending on the operations of the UAVs, we adopt two different scenarios, namely integrated UAV and separated UAV WPCNs. First, in the integrated UAV WPCN, a UAV acts as a hybrid AP in which both energy transfer and information reception are processed at a single UAV. In contrast, for the separated UAV WPCN, we consider two UAVs each of which behaves as an energy AP and an information AP independently, and thus the energy transfer and the information decoding are separately performed at two different UAVs. For both systems, we jointly optimize the trajectories of the UAVs, the uplink power control, and the time resource allocation for the WET and the WIT to maximize the minimum throughput of the GTs. Since the formulated problems are non-convex, we apply the concave-convex procedure by deriving appropriate convex bounds for non-convex constraints. As a result, we propose iterative algorithms which efficiently identify a local optimal solution for the minimum throughput maximization problems. Simulation results verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithms compared to conventional schemes.;cs.IT
1801.02782;UAV-Aided Wireless Communication Designs With Propulsion Energy Limitations;This paper studies unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided wireless communication systems where a UAV supports uplink communications of multiple ground nodes (GNs) while flying over the area of the interest. In this system, the propulsion energy consumption at the UAV is taken into account so that the UAV's velocity and acceleration should not exceed a certain threshold. We formulate the minimum average rate maximization problem and the energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem by jointly optimizing the trajectory, velocity, and acceleration of the UAV and the uplink transmit power at the GNs. As these problems are non-convex in general, we employ the successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. To this end, proper convex approximations for the non-convex constraints are derived, and iterative algorithms are proposed which converge to a local optimal point. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform baseline schemes for both problems. Especially for the EE maximization problem, the proposed algorithm exhibits about 109 % gain over the baseline scheme.;cs.IT
1801.02784;Spectral Radius of $\{0, 1\}$-Tensor with Prescribed Number of Ones;For any $r$-order $\{0, 1\}$-tensor $A$ with $e$ ones, we prove that the spectral radius of $A$ is at most $e^{\frac{r-1}{r}}$ with the equality holds if and only if $e={k^r}$ for some integer $k$ and all ones forms a principal sub-tensor ${\bf 1}_{k\times \cdots \times k}$. We also prove a stability result for general tensor $A$ with $e$ ones where $e=k^r+l$ with relatively small $l$. Using the stability result, we completely characterized the tensors achieving the maximum spectral radius among all $r$-order $\{0, 1\}$-tensor $A$ with $k^r+l$ ones, for $-r-1\leq l \leq r$, and $k$ sufficiently large.;math.CO
1801.02785;Fusion frames for operators and atomic systems;Recently, fusion frames and frames for operators were considered as generalizations of frames in Hilbert spaces. In this paper, we generalize some of the known results in frame theory to fusion frames related to a linear bounded operator K which we call K-fusion frames. We obtain new K-fusion frames by considering K-fusion frames with a class of bounded linear operators. We also study the stability of K-fusion frames under small perturbations. We further give some characterizations of atomic systems with subspace sequences.;math.FA
1801.02792;Balanced Truncation Model Reduction of a Nonlinear Cable-Mass PDE System with Interior Damping;We consider model order reduction of a nonlinear cable-mass system modeled by a 1D wave equation with interior damping and dynamic boundary conditions. The system is driven by a time dependent forcing input to a linear mass-spring system at one boundary. The goal of the model reduction is to produce a low order model that produces an accurate approximation to the displacement and velocity of the mass in the nonlinear mass-spring system at the opposite boundary. We first prove that the linearized and nonlinear unforced systems are well-posed and exponentially stable under certain conditions on the damping parameters, and then consider a balanced truncation method to generate the reduced order model (ROM) of the nonlinear input-output system. Little is known about model reduction of nonlinear input-output systems, and so we present detailed numerical experiments concerning the performance of the nonlinear ROM. We find that the ROM is accurate for many different combinations of model parameters.;math.OC
1801.02795;Asymptotics for Null-timelike Boundary Problems for General Linear Wave Equations;We study the linear wave equation $\Box_{g}u=0$ in Bondi-Sachs coordinates, for an asymptotically flat Lorentz metric $g$. We consider the null-timelike boundary problem, where an initial value is given on the null surface $\tau=0$ and a boundary value on the timelike surface $r=r_{0}$. We obtain spacetime $H^{p}$-estimates of $ru$ for $r&gt,r_0$ and derive an asymptotic exapnsion of $ru$ in terms of ${1}/{r}$ as $r\to\infty$.;math.AP
1801.02799;Flight Time Minimization of UAV for Data Collection over Wireless Sensor Networks;In this paper, we consider a scenario where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) collects data from a set of sensors on a straight line. The UAV can either cruise or hover while communicating with the sensors. The objective is to minimize the UAV's total flight time from a starting point to a destination while allowing each sensor to successfully upload a certain amount of data using a given amount of energy. The whole trajectory is divided into non-overlapping data collection intervals, in each of which one sensor is served by the UAV. The data collection intervals, the UAV's speed and the sensors' transmit powers are jointly optimized. The formulated flight time minimization problem is difficult to solve. We first show that when only one sensor is present, the sensor's transmit power follows a water-filling policy and the UAV's speed can be found efficiently by bisection search. Then, we show that for the general case with multiple sensors, the flight time minimization problem can be equivalently reformulated as a dynamic programming (DP) problem. The subproblem involved in each stage of the DP reduces to handle the case with only one sensor node. Numerical results present insightful behaviors of the UAV and the sensors. Specifically, it is observed that the UAV's optimal speed is proportional to the given energy of the sensors and the inter-sensor distance, but inversely proportional to the data upload requirement.;cs.IT
1801.02812;Quantitative Simplification of Filtered Simplicial Complexes;We introduce a new invariant defined on the vertices of a given filtered simplicial complex, called codensity, which controls the impact of removing vertices on persistent homology. We achieve this control through the use of an interleaving type of distance between fitered simplicial complexes. We study the special case of Vietoris-Rips filtrations and show that our bounds offer a significant improvement over the immediate bounds coming from considerations related to the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. Based on these ideas we give an iterative method for the practical simplification of filtered simplicial complexes. <br />As a byproduct of our analysis we identify a notion of core of a filtered simplicial complex which admits the interpretation as a minimalistic simplicial filtration which retains all the persistent homology information.;math.AT
1801.02818;k-connectivity of Random Graphs and Random Geometric Graphs in Node Fault Model;k-connectivity of random graphs is a fundamental property indicating reliability of multi-hop wireless sensor networks (WSN). WSNs comprising of sensor nodes with limited power resources are modeled by random graphs with unreliable nodes, which is known as the node fault model. In this paper, we investigate k-connectivity of random graphs in the node fault model by evaluating the network breakdown probability, i.e., the disconnectivity probability of random graphs after stochastic node removals. Using the notion of a strongly typical set, we obtain universal asymptotic upper and lower bounds of the network breakdown probability. The bounds are applicable both to random graphs and to random geometric graphs. We then consider three representative random graph ensembles: the Erdos-Renyi random graph as the simplest case, the random intersection graph for WSNs with random key predistribution schemes, and the random geometric graph as a model of WSNs generated by random sensor node deployment. The bounds unveil the existence of the phase transition of the network breakdown probability for those ensembles.;cs.IT

1801.02830;Beam domain secure transmission for massive MIMO communications;We investigate the optimality and power allocation algorithm of beam domain transmission for single-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with a multi-antenna passive eavesdropper. Focusing on the secure massive MIMO downlink transmission with only statistical channel state information of legitimate users and the eavesdropper at base station, we introduce a lower bound on the achievable ergodic secrecy sum-rate, from which we derive the condition for eigenvectors of the optimal input covariance matrices. The result shows that beam domain transmission can achieve optimal performance in terms of secrecy sum-rate lower bound maximization. For the case of single-antenna legitimate users, we prove that it is optimal to allocate no power to the beams where the beam gains of the eavesdropper are stronger than those of legitimate users in order to maximize the secrecy sum-rate lower bound. Then, motivated by the concave-convex procedure and the large dimension random matrix theory, we develop an efficient iterative and convergent algorithm to optimize power allocation in the beam domain. Numerical simulations demonstrate the tightness of the secrecy sum-rate lower bound and the near-optimal performance of the proposed iterative algorithm.;cs.IT

The proposed first and higher order moment closure methods enable numerical simulations of the kinetic equation. Their performance is then compared to that of the diffusion limit. The approach allows for DTI-based, patient-specific predictions of the tumor extent and its dynamic behavior.;math.NA

We also discuss the reductions of the MKP hierarchy to the modified $n$-KdV hierarchies. As a byproduct, we find an astonishingly simple explicit description of all polynomial tau-functions of the KP, the MKP and the $n$-KdV hierarchies, and (implicitly) also for the modified $n$-KdV hierarchy.;math-ph
1801.02846;Data assimilation and parameter estimation for a multiscale stochastic system with alpha-stable Levy noise;This work is about low dimensional reduction for a slow-fast data assimilation system with non-Gaussian $\alpha-$stable L\'evy noise via stochastic averaging. When the observations are only available for slow components, we show that the averaged, low dimensional filter approximates the original filter, by examining the corresponding Zakai stochastic partial differential equations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the low dimensional slow system approximates the slow dynamics of the original system, by examining parameter estimation and most probable paths.;math.DS
1801.02847;Partial regularity for solutions to subelliptic eikonal equations;On a bounded domain $\Omega$ in euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, we study the homogeneous Dirichlet problem for the eikonal equation associated with a system of smooth vector fields, which satisfies H\"ormander's bracket generating condition. We prove that the solution is smooth in the complement of a closed set of Lebesgue measure zero.;math.OC
1801.02849;Numerical inverse Laplace transform for convection-diffusion equations;In this paper a novel contour integral method is proposed for linear convection-diffusion equations. The method is based on the inversion of the Laplace transform and makes use of a contour given by an elliptic arc joined symmetrically to two half-lines. The trapezoidal rule is the chosen integration method for the numerical inversion of the Laplace transform, due to its well-known fast convergence properties when applied to analytic functions. Error estimates are provided as well as careful indications about the choice of several involved parameters. The method selects the elliptic arc in the integration contour by an algorithmic strategy based on the computation of pseudospectral level sets of the discretized differential operator. In this sense the method is general and can be applied to any linear convection-diffusion equation without knowing any a priori information about its pseudospectral geometry. Numerical experiments performed on the Black-Scholes ($1D$) and Heston ($2D$) equations show that the method is competitive with other contour integral methods available in the literature.;math.NA
1801.02856;Exponential stability of solutions to perturbed superstable wave equations;The paper deals with initial-boundary value problems for the linear wave equation whose solutions stabilize to zero in a finite time. We prove that problems in this class remain exponentially stable in $L^2$ as well as in $C^2$ under small bounded perturbations of the wave operator. To show this for $C^2$, we prove a smoothing result implying that the solutions to the perturbed problems become eventually $C^2$-smooth for any $H^1\times L^2$-initial data.;math.AP
1801.02860;Channel Estimation with Systematic Polar Codes;Study of polar codes in fading channels is of great importance when applying polar codes in wireless communications. Channel estimation is a fundamental step for communication to be possible in fading channels. For both systematic and non-systematic polar codes, construction of them is based on an information set and the known frozen bits. Efficient implementation of systematic and non-systematic polar codes exists. When it comes to channel estimation or channel tracking, additional pilot symbols are inserted in the codeword traditionally. In this paper, to improve the performance of polar codes in the finite domain, pilot symbols are selected from the coded symbols themselves. In order to keep the existing efficient structure of polar code encoding, pilot selection is critical since not all selections can reuse the existing structure. In this paper, two pilot selections denoted as Uneven Pilot Selection (UEPS) and Even Pilot Selection (EPS) are proposed, which do not change the efficient polar encoding structure. The proposed UEPS and EPS is proven to satisfy the efficient construction condition. The performance of EPS is shown in this paper to outperform both the UEPS and the traditional pilot insertion scheme. Simulation results are provided which verify the performance of the proposed pilot selection schemes.;cs.IT
1801.02867;A homogenization result for weak membrane energies;We prove a $\Gamma$-convergence result for space dependent weak membrane energies, that is for 'truncated quadratic potentials', that are quadratic below some threshold (depending on the pair of points that we are considering) and constant above. We prove that the limit surface energy density coincides with the one for spin systems, while the bulk energy density is not affected by the different levels of truncation and coincides with an purely elastic energy density.;math.AP
1801.02868;Linear Codes for Broadcasting with Noisy Side Information;We consider network coding for a noiseless broadcast channel where each receiver demands a subset of messages available at the transmitter and is equipped with noisy side information in the form an erroneous version of the message symbols it demands. We view the message symbols as elements from a finite field and assume that the number of symbol errors in the noisy side information is upper bounded by a known constant. This communication problem, which we refer to as 'broadcasting with noisy side information' (BNSI), has applications in the re-transmission phase of downlink networks. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a linear coding scheme to satisfy the demands of all the receivers in a given BNSI network, and show that syndrome decoding can be used at the receivers to decode the demanded messages from the received codeword and the available noisy side information. We represent BNSI problems as bipartite graphs, and using this representation, classify the family of problems where linear coding provides bandwidth savings compared to uncoded transmission. We provide a simple algorithm to determine if a given BNSI network belongs to this family of problems, i.e., to identify if linear coding provides an advantage over uncoded transmission for the given BNSI problem. We provide lower bounds and upper bounds on the optimal codelength and constructions of linear coding schemes based on linear error correcting codes. For any given BNSI problem, we construct an equivalent index coding problem. A linear code is a valid scheme for a BNSI problem if and only if it is valid for the constructed index coding problem.;cs.IT
1801.02871;Uniform decomposition of probability measures: quantization, classification, rate of convergence;The study of finite approximations of probability measures has a long history. In (Xu and Berger, 2017), the authors focus on constrained finite approximations and, in particular, uniform ones in dimension $d=1$. The present paper gives an elementary construction of a uniform decomposition of probability measures in dimension $d\geq 1$. This decomposition is then used to give upper-bounds on the rate of convergence of the optimal uniform approximation error. These bounds appear to be the generalization of the ones obtained in (Xu and Berger, 2017) and to be sharp for generic probability measures.;math.PR
1801.02873;Vanishing of Hyperelliptic L-functions at the Central Point;We obtain a lower bound on the number of quadratic Dirichlet L-functions over the rational function field which vanish at the central point $s = 1/2$. This is in contrast with the situation over the rational numbers, where a conjecture of Chowla predicts there should be no such L-functions. The approach is based on the observation that vanishing at the central point can be interpreted geometrically, as the existence of a map to a fixed abelian variety from the hyperelliptic curve associated to the character.;math.NT
1801.02875;Multi-Terminal Codes Using Constrained-Random-Number Generators;A general multi-terminal source code and a general multi-terminal channel code are presented. Constrained-random-number generators with sparse matrices, which are building blocks for the code construction, are used in the construction of both encoders and decoders. Achievable regions for source coding and channel coding are derived in terms of entropy functions, where the capacity region for channel coding provides an alternative to the region of [Somekh-Baruch and Verd\'u, ISIT2006].;cs.IT
1801.02876;Generalizations of Fano&#x27,s Inequality for Conditional Information Measures via Majorization Theory;Fano's inequality is one of the most elementary, ubiquitous, and important tools in information theory. Using majorization theory, Fano's inequality is generalized to a broad class of information measures, which contains those of Shannon and R\'{e}nyi. When specialized to these measures, it recovers and generalizes the classical inequalities. Key to the derivation is the construction of an appropriate conditional distribution inducing a desired marginal distribution on a countably infinite alphabet. The construction is based on the infinite-dimensional version of Birkhoff's theorem proven by R\'{e}v\'{e}sz [Acta Math. Hungar. 1962, 3, 188{\textendash}198], and the constraint of maintaining a desired marginal distribution is similar to coupling in probability theory. Using our Fano-type inequalities for Shannon's and R\'{e}nyi's information measures, we also investigate the asymptotic behavior of the sequence of Shannon's and R\'{e}nyi's equivocations when the error probabilities vanish. This asymptotic behavior provides a novel characterization of the asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) via Fano's inequality.;cs.IT
1801.02883;Mean-field evolution of fermions with singular interaction;We consider a system of N fermions in the mean-field regime interacting though an inverse power law potential $V(x)=1/|x|^{\alpha}$, for $\alpha\in(0,1]$. We prove the convergence of a solution of the many-body Schr\"{o}dinger equation to a solution of the time-dependent Hartree-Fock equation in the sense of reduced density matrices. We stress the dependence on the singularity of the potential in the regularity of the initial data. The proof is an adaptation of [22], where the case $\alpha=1$ is treated.;math-ph
1801.02885;Unlikely Intersections in families of abelian varieties and the polynomial Pell equation;Let S be a smooth irreducible curve defined over a number field k and consider an abelian scheme A over S and a curve C inside A, both defined over k. In previous works, we proved that when A is a fibered product of elliptic schemes, if C is not contained in a proper subgroup scheme of A, then it contains at most finitely many points that belong to a flat subgroup scheme of codimension at least 2. In this article, we continue our investigation and settle the crucial case of powers of simple abelian schemes of relative dimension g bigger or equal than 2. This, combined with the above mentioned result and work by Habegger and Pila, gives the statement for general abelian schemes. These results have applications in the study of solvability of almost-Pell equations in polynomials.;math.NT
1801.02888;Analysis of Massive MIMO and Base Station Cooperation in an Indoor Scenario;The performance of centralized and distributed massive MIMO deployments are analyzed for indoor office scenarios. The distributed deployments use one of the following precoding methods: (1) local precoding with local channel state information (CSI) to the user equipments (UEs) that it serves, (2) large-scale MIMO with local CSI to all UEs in the network, (3) network MIMO with global CSI. For the distributed deployments (2) and (3), it is shown that using twice as many base station antennas as data streams provides many of the massive MIMO benefits in terms of spectral efficiency and fairness. This is in contrast to the centralized deployment and the distributed deployment (1) where more antennas are needed. Two of the main conclusions are that distributing base stations helps to overcome wall penetration loss, however, a backhaul is required to mitigate inter-cell interference. The effect of estimation errors on the performance is also quantified.;cs.IT
1801.02890;Symbol-by-Symbol Maximum Likelihood Detection for Cooperative Molecular Communication;In this paper, symbol-by-symbol maximum likelihood (ML) detection is proposed for a cooperative diffusion-based molecular communication (MC) system. In this system, the transmitter (TX) sends a common information symbol to multiple receivers (RXs) and a fusion center (FC) chooses the TX symbol that is more likely, given the likelihood of its observations from all RXs. The transmission of a sequence of binary symbols and the resultant intersymbol interference are considered in the cooperative MC system. Three ML detection variants are proposed according to different RX behaviors and different knowledge at the FC. The system error probabilities for two ML detector variants are derived, one of which is in closed form. The optimal molecule allocation among RXs to minimize the system error probability of one variant is determined by solving a joint optimization problem. Also for this variant, the equal distribution of molecules among two symmetric RXs is analytically shown to achieve the local minimal error probability. Numerical and simulation results show that the ML detection variants provide lower bounds on the error performance of simpler, non-ML cooperative variants and demonstrate that these simpler cooperative variants have error performance comparable to ML detectors.;cs.IT
1801.02893;What did Ryser Conjecture?;Two prominent conjectures by Herbert J. Ryser have been falsely attributed to a somewhat obscure conference proceedings that he wrote in German. Here we provide a translation of that paper and try to correct the historical record at least as far as what was conjectured in it. The two conjectures relate to transversals in Latin squares of odd order and to the relationship between the covering number and the matching number of multipartite hypergraphs.;math.CO
1801.02894;Spatial Lattice Modulation for MIMO Systems;This paper proposes spatial lattice modulation (SLM), a spatial modulation method for multipleinput-multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The key idea of SLM is to jointly exploit spatial, in-phase, and quadrature dimensions to modulate information bits into a multi-dimensional signal set that consists oflattice points. One major finding is that SLM achieves a higher spectral efficiency than the existing spatial modulation and spatial multiplexing methods for the MIMO channel under the constraint ofM-ary pulseamplitude-modulation (PAM) input signaling per dimension. In particular, it is shown that when the SLM signal set is constructed by using dense lattices, a significant signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) gain, i.e., a nominal coding gain, is attainable compared to the existing methods. In addition, closed-form expressions for both the average mutual information and average symbol-vector-error-probability (ASVEP) of generic SLM are derived under Rayleigh-fading environments. To reduce detection complexity, a low-complexity detection method for SLM, which is referred to as lattice sphere decoding, is developed by exploiting lattice theory. Simulation results verify the accuracy of the conducted analysis and demonstrate that the proposed SLM techniques achieve higher average mutual information and lower ASVEP than do existing methods.;cs.IT
1801.02910;New bounds for exponential sums with a non-degenerate phase polynomial;We prove a recent conjecture due to Cluckers and Veys on exponential sums modulo $p^m$ for $m \geq 2$ in the special case where the phase polynomial $f$ is sufficiently non-degenerate with respect to its Newton polyhedron at the origin. Our main auxiliary result is an improved bound on certain related exponential sums over finite fields. This bound can also be used to settle a conjecture of Denef and Hoornaert on the candidate-leading Taylor coefficient of Igusa's local zeta function associated to a non-degenerate polynomial, at its largest non-trivial real candidate pole.;math.NT
1801.02912;Null Lagrangian Measures in subspaces, compensated compactness and conservation laws;Compensated compactness is an important method used to solve nonlinear PDEs. A simple formulation of a compensated compactness problem is to ask for conditions on a set $\mathcal{K}\subset M^{m\times n}$ such that $$ \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \mathrm{dist}(Du_n,\mathcal{K})\overset{L^p}{\rightarrow} 0\, \Rightarrow \{Du_{n}\}_{n}\text{ is precompact.} $$ Let $M_1,M_2,\dots, M_q$ denote the set of minors of $M^{m\times n}$. A sufficient condition for this is that any measure $\mu$ supported on $\mathcal{K}$ satisfying $$ \int M_k(X) d\mu (X)=M_k\left(\int X d\mu (X)\right)\text{ for }k=1,2,\dots, q $$ is a Dirac measure. We call measures that satisfy the above equation "Null Lagrangian Measures" and we denote the set of Null Lagrangian Measures supported on $\mathcal{K}$ by $\mathcal{M}^{pc}(\mathcal{K})$. For general $m,n$, a necessary and sufficient condition for triviality of $\mathcal{M}^{pc}(\mathcal{K})$ was an open question even in the case where $\mathcal{K}$ is a linear subspace of $M^{m\times n}$. We answer this question and provide a necessary and sufficient condition for any linear subspace $\mathcal{K}\subset M^{m\times n}$. The ideas also allow us to show that for any $d\in \left\{1,2,3\right\}$, $d$-dimensional subspaces $\mathcal{K}\subset M^{m\times n}$ support non-trivial Null Lagrangian Measures if and only if $\mathcal{K}$ has Rank-$1$ connections. This is known to be false for $d\ge 4$. <br />Using the ideas developed we are able to answer (up to first order) a question of Kirchheim, M\"{u}ller and Sverak on the Null Lagrangian measures arising in the study of a (one) entropy solution of a $2\times 2$ system of conservation laws that arises in elasticity.;math.AP
1801.02913;The DMT classification of real and quaternionic lattice codes;In this paper we consider space-time codes where the code-words are restricted to either real or quaternion matrices. We prove two separate diversity-multiplexing gain trade-off (DMT) upper bounds for such codes and provide a criterion for a lattice code to achieve these upper bounds. We also point out that lattice codes based on Q-central division algebras satisfy this optimality criterion. As a corollary this result provides a DMT classification for all Q-central division algebra codes that are based on standard embeddings.;cs.IT
1801.02920;On singularity properties of convolutions of algebraic morphisms;Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero, $X$ and $Y$ be smooth $K$-varieties, and let $V$ be a finite dimensional $K$-vector space. For two algebraic morphisms $\varphi:X\rightarrow V$ and $\psi:Y\rightarrow V$ we define a convolution operation, $\varphi*\psi:X\times Y\to V$, by $\varphi*\psi(x,y)=\varphi(x)+\psi(y)$. We then study the singularity properties of the resulting morphism, and show that as in the case of convolution in analysis, it has improved smoothness properties. <br />Explicitly, we show that for any morphism $\varphi:X\rightarrow V$ which is dominant when restricted to each irreducible component of $X$, there exists $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that for any $n&gt,N$ the $n$-th convolution power $\varphi^{n}:=\varphi*\dots*\varphi$ is a flat morphism with reduced geometric fibers of rational singularities (this property is abbreviated (FRS)). By a theorem of Aizenbud and Avni, for $K=\mathbb{Q}$, this is equivalent to good asymptotic behavior of the size of the $\mathbb{Z}/p^{k}\mathbb{Z}$-fibers of $\varphi^{n}$ when ranging over both $p$ and $k$. <br />More generally, we show that given a family of morphisms $\{\varphi_{i}:X_{i}\rightarrow V\}$ of complexity $D\in\mathbb{N}$ (i.e. that the number of variables and the degrees of the polynomials defining $X_{i}$ and $\varphi_{i}$ are bounded by $D$), there exists $N(D)\in\mathbb{N}$ such that for any $n&gt,N(D)$, the morphism $\varphi_{1}*\dots*\varphi_{n}$ is (FRS).;math.AG
1801.02921;The genericity of Arnold diffusion in nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems;In this paper, we prove that the net of transition chain is $\delta$-dense for nearly integrable positive definite Hamiltonian systems with 3 degrees of freedom in the cusp-residual generic sense in $C^r$-topology, $r\ge 6$. The main ingredients of the proof existed in \cite{CZ,C17a,C17b}. As an immediate consequence, Arnold diffusion exists among this class of Hamiltonian systems. The question of \cite{C17c} is answered in Section 9 of the paper.;math.DS
1801.02922;Groupoids and Wreath Products of Musical Transformations: a Categorical Approach from poly-Klumpenhouwer Networks;Transformational music theory, pioneered by the work of Lewin, shifts the music-theoretical and analytical focus from the "object-oriented" musical content to an operational musical process, in which transformations between musical elements are emphasized. In the original framework of Lewin, the set of transformations often form a group, with a corresponding group action on a given set of musical objects. Klumpenhouwer networks have been introduced based on this framework: they are informally labelled graphs, the labels of the vertices being pitch classes, and the labels of the arrows being transformations that maps the corresponding pitch classes. Klumpenhouwer networks have been recently formalized and generalized in a categorical setting, called poly-Klumpenhouwer networks. This work proposes a new groupoid-based approach to transformational music theory, in which transformations of PK-nets are considered rather than ordinary sets of musical objects. We show how groupoids of musical transformations can be constructed, and an application of their use in post-tonal music analysis with Berg's Four pieces for clarinet and piano, Op. 5/2. In a second part, we show how groupoids are linked to wreath products (which feature prominently in transformational music analysis) through the notion of groupoid bisections;math.GR
1801.02923;Wirtinger Numbers for Virtual Links;The Wirtinger number of a virtual link is the minimum number of generators of the link group over all meridional presentations in which every relation is an iterated Wirtinger relation arising in a diagram. We prove that the Wirtinger number of a virtual link equals its virtual bridge number. Since the Wirtinger number is algorithmically computable, it gives a more effective way to calculate an upper bound for the virtual bridge number from a virtual link diagram. As an application, we compute upper bounds for the virtual bridge numbers and the quandle counting invariants of virtual knots with 6 or fewer crossings. In particular, we found new examples of nontrivial virtual bridge number one knots, and by applying Satoh's Tube map to these knots we can obtain nontrivial weakly superslice links.;math.GT
1801.02926;Haantjes Algebras of the Lagrange Top;A symplectic-Haantjes manifold and a Poisson-Haantjes manifold for the Lagrange top are studied and a set of Darboux-Haantjes coordinates are computed. Such coordinates are separation variables for the associated Hamilton-Jacobi equation.;math-ph
1801.02927;Fibred Categories a la Jean Benabou;These are notes about the theory of Fibred Categories as I have learned it from Jean Benabou. I also have used results from the Thesis of Jean-Luc Moens from 1982 in those sections where I discuss the fibered view of geometric morphisms. Thus, almost all of the contents is not due to me but most of it cannot be found in the literature since Benabou has given many talks on it but most of his work on fibered categories is unpublished. But I am solely responsible for the mistakes and for misrepresentations of his views. And certainly these notes do not cover all the work he has done on fibered categories. I just try to explain the most important notions he has come up with in a way trying to be as close as possible to his intentions and intuitions. I started these notes in 1999 when I gave a course on some of the material at a workshop in Munich. They have developed quite a lot over the years and I have tried to include most of the things I want to remember.;math.CT
1801.02930;An Improved Analysis of Least Squares Superposition Codes with Bernoulli Dictionary;For the additive white Gaussian noise channel with average power constraint, sparse superposition codes, proposed by Barron and Joseph in 2010, achieve the capacity. While the codewords of the original sparse superposition codes are made with a dictionary matrix drawn from a Gaussian distribution, we consider the case that it is drawn from a Bernoulli distribution. We show an improved upper bound on its block error probability with least squares decoding, which is fairly simplified and tighter bound than our previous result in 2014.;cs.IT
1801.02932;Polynomials describing the multiplication in finitely generated torsion free nilpotent groups;A famous result of Hall asserts that the multiplication and exponentiation in finitely generated torsion free nilpotent groups can be described by rational polynomials. We describe an algorithm to determine such polynomials for all torsion free nilpotent groups of given Hirsch length. We apply this to determine the Hall polynomials for all such groups of Hirsch length at most 7.;math.GR
1801.02934;Unitarily invariant norm inequalities involving $G_1$ operators;In this paper, we present some upper bounds for unitarily invariant norms inequalities. Among other inequalities, we show some upper bounds for the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. In particular, we prove \begin{align*} \|f(A)Xg(B)\pm g(B)Xf(A)\|_2\leq \left\|\frac{(I+|A|)X(I+|B|)+(I+|B|)X(I+|A|)}{d_Ad_B}\right\|_2, \end{align*} where $A, B, X\in\mathbb{M}_n$ such that $A$, $B$ are Hermitian with $\sigma (A)\cup\sigma(B)\subset\mathbb{D}$ and $f, g$ are analytic on the complex unit disk $\mathbb{{D}}$, $g(0)=f(0)=1$, $\textrm{Re}(f)&gt,0$ and $\textrm{Re}(g)&gt,0$.;math.FA
1801.02942;The Petersen graph has no quantum symmetry;In 2007, Banica and Bichon asked whether the well-known Petersen graph has quantum symmetry. In this article, we show that the Petersen graph has no quantum symmetry, i.e. the quantum automorphism group of the Petersen graph is its usual automorphism group, the symmetric group $S_5$.;math.OA
1801.02952;The spectrum of the Laplacian on forms;In this article we prove a generalization of Weyl's criterion for the spectrum of a self-adjoint nonnegative operator on a Hilbert space. We will apply this new criterion in combination with Cheeger-Fukaya-Gromov and Cheeger-Colding theory to study the $k$-form essential spectrum over a complete manifold with vanishing curvature at infinity or asymptotically nonnegative Ricci curvature. <br />In addition, we will apply the generalized Weyl criterion to study the variation of the spectrum of a self-adjoint operator under continuous perturbations of the operator. In the particular case of the Laplacian on $k$-forms over a complete manifold we will use these analytic tools to find significantly stronger results for its spectrum including its behavior under a continuous deformation of the metric of the manifold.;math.DG
1801.02957;Topology of planar self-affine tiles with collinear digit set;We consider the self-affine tiles with collinear digit set defined as follows. Let $A,B\in\mathbb{Z}$ satisfy $|A|\leq B\geq 2$ and $M\in\mathbb{Z}^{2\times2}$ be an integral matrix with characteristic polynomial $x^2+Ax+B$. Moreover, let $\mathcal{D}=\{0,v,2v,\ldots,(B-1)v\}$ for some $v\in\mathbb{Z}^2$ such that $v,M v$ are linearly independent. We are interested in the topological properties of the self-affine tile $\mathcal{T}$ defined by $M\mathcal{T}=\bigcup_{d\in\mathcal{D}}(\mathcal{T}+d)$. Lau and Leung proved that $\mathcal{T}$ is homeomorphic to a closed disk if and only if $2|A|\leq B+2$. In particular, $\mathcal{T}$ has no cut point. We prove here that $\mathcal{T}$ has a cut point if and only if $2|A|\geq B+5$. For $2|A|-B\in \{3,4\}$, the interior of $\mathcal{T}$ is disconnected and the closure of each connected component of the interior of $\mathcal{T}$ is homeomorphic to a closed disk.;math.GN
1801.02962;Bayesian Fitting of Dirichlet Type I and II Distributions;In his 1986 book, Aitchison explains that compositional data is regularly mishandled in statistical analyses, a pattern that continues to this day. The Dirichlet Type I distribution is a multivariate distribution commonly used to model a set of proportions that sum to one. Aitchinson goes on to lament the difficulties of Dirichlet modelling and the scarcity of alternatives. While he addresses the second of these issues, we address the first. The Dirichlet Type II distribution is a transformation of the Dirichlet Type I distribution and is a multivariate distribution on the positive real numbers with only one more parameter than the number of dimensions. This property of Dirichlet distributions implies advantages over common alternatives as the number of dimensions increase. While not all data is amenable to Dirichlet modelling, there are many cases where the Dirichlet family is the obvious choice. We describe the Dirichlet distributions and show how to fit them using both frequentist and Bayesian methods (we derive and apply two objective priors). The Beta distribution is discussed as a special case. We report a small simulation study to compare the fitting methods. We derive the conditional distributions and posterior predictive conditional distributions. The flexibility of this distribution family is illustrated via examples, the last of which discusses imputation (using the posterior predictive conditional distributions).;math.ST
1801.02963;Gauge theory and foliations I, germ cords versus quantum cords;We apply gauge theory to study the space $F_k(M)$ of smooth codimension-$k$ framed foliations on a smooth manifold $M$. The quotient of Maurer-Cartan elements by the action of an infinite dimensional non-abelian gauge groupoid forms a moduli space, which contains $F_k(M)$ as a subspace. The notion of holonomy is naturally extended to this moduli space and the cohomology theory associated with points of this moduli space which correspond to non-singular foliations coincides with Bott cohomology. The quotient of the moduli space under concordance is identified as the space of homotopy classes of maps to the classifying spaces $B\Gamma^g_k$ and $B\Gamma^q_k$. While $B\Gamma^g$ is a classic and has been studied since Haefliger, $B\Gamma^q$ (which is a quotient of $B\Gamma^g$) carries a simpler topology and offers a rival theory.;math.DG
1801.02964;Quasi-shuffle algebras and renormalisation of rough differential equations;The objective of this work is to compare several approaches to the process of renormalisation in the context of rough differential equations using the substitution bialgebra on rooted trees known from backward error analysis of $B$-series. For this purpose, we present a so-called arborification of the Hoffman--Ihara theory of quasi-shuffle algebra automorphisms. The latter are induced by formal power series, which can be seen to be special cases of the cointeraction of two Hopf algebra structures on rooted forests. In particular, the arborification of Hoffman's exponential map, which defines a Hopf algebra isomorphism between the shuffle and quasi-shuffle Hopf algebra, leads to a canonical renormalisation that coincides with Marcus' canonical extension for semimartingale driving signals. This is contrasted with the canonical geometric rough path of Hairer and Kelly by means of a recursive formula defined in terms of the coaction of the substitution bialgebra.;math.PR
1801.02967;Asynchronous distributed algorithms for seeking generalized Nash equilibria under full and partial decision information;We investigate asynchronous distributed algorithms with delayed information for seeking generalized Nash equilibrium over multi-agent networks. The considered game model has all players' local decisions coupled with a shared affine constraint. We assume each player can only access its local objective function, local constraint, and a local block matrix of the affine constraint. We first give the algorithm for the case when each agent is able to fully access all other players' decisions. With the help of auxiliary edge variables and edge Laplacian matrix, each player can carry on its local iteration in an asynchronous manner, using only local data and possibly delayed neighbour information. And then we investigate the case when the agents cannot know all other players' decisions, which is called a partial decision case. We introduce a local estimation of the overall decisions for each agent in the partial decision case, and develop another asynchronous algorithm by incorporating consensus dynamics on the local estimations of the overall decisions. Since both algorithms do not need any centralized clock coordination, the algorithms fully exploit the local computation resource of each player, and remove the idle time due to waiting for the "slowest" agent. Both algorithms are developed by a preconditioned forward-backward operator splitting method, while convergence is shown with the help of asynchronous fixed-point iterations under proper assumptions and fixed step-size choices. Numerical studies verify both algorithms' convergence and efficiency.;math.OC
1801.02968;The set of vertices with positive curvature in a planar graph with nonnegative curvature;In this paper, we give the sharp upper bound for the number of vertices with positive curvature in a planar graph with nonnegative combinatorial curvature.

We also present a recent generalization of this construction due to Saroch which applies to factorization properties of maps, and yields a solution of an old problem by Auslander concerning existence of almost split sequences.;math.RT
1801.02973;Global fluctuations for 1D log-gas dynamics. (2) Covariance kernel and support;We consider the hydrodynamic limit in the macroscopic regime of the coupled system of stochastic differential equations, $ d\lambda_t^i=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} dW_t^i - V'(\lambda_t^i) dt+ \frac{\beta}{2N} \sum_{j\not=i} \frac{dt}{\lambda^i_t-\lambda^j_t}, \qquad i=1,\ldots,N, $ with $\beta&gt,1$, sometimes called generalized Dyson's Brownian motion, describing the dissipative dynamics of a log-gas of $N$ equal charges with equilibrium measure corresponding to a $\beta$-ensemble, with sufficiently regular convex potential $V$. The limit $N\to\infty$ is known to satisfy a mean-field Mc Kean-Vlasov equation. Fluctuations around this limit have been shown by the author to define a Gaussian process solving some explicit martingale problem written in terms of a generalized transport equation. <br />We prove a series of results concerning either the Mc Kean-Vlasov equation for the density $\rho_t$, notably regularity results and time-evolution of the support, or the associated hydrodynamic fluctuation process, whose space-time covariance kernel we compute explicitly.;math.PR
1801.02976;Binary CEO Problem under Log-Loss with BSC Test-Channel Model;In this paper, we propose an efficient coding scheme for the two-link binary Chief Executive Officer (CEO) problem under logarithmic loss criterion. The exact rate-distortion bound for a two-link binary CEO problem under the logarithmic loss has been obtained by Courtade and Weissman. We propose an encoding scheme based on compound LDGM-LDPC codes to achieve the theoretical bounds. In the proposed encoding, a binary quantizer using LDGM codes and a syndrome-coding employing LDPC codes are applied. An iterative joint decoding is also designed as a fusion center. The proposed CEO decoder is based on the sum-product algorithm and a soft estimator.;cs.IT
1801.02978;An EDG Method for Distributed Optimal Control of Elliptic PDEs;We consider a distributed optimal control problem governed by an elliptic PDE, and propose an embedded discontinuous Galerkin (EDG) method to approximate the solution. We derive optimal a priori error estimates for the state, dual state, the optimal control, and suboptimal estimates for the fluxes. We present numerical experiments to confirm our theoretical results.;math.NA
1801.02979;Steady-State Behavior of Some Load Balancing Mechanisms in Cloud Storage Systems;In large storage systems, files are often coded across several servers to improve reliability and retrieval speed. We consider a system of $n$ servers storing files using a Maximum Distance Separable code (cf. \cite{li2016mean}). Specifically, each file is stored in equally sized pieces across $L$ servers such that any $k$ pieces can reconstruct the original file. File requests are routed using the Batch Sampling routing scheme. I.e. when a request for a file is received, a centralized dispatcher routes the job into the $k$-shortest queues among the $L$ for which the corresponding server contains a piece of the file being requested. We study the long time behavior of this class of load balancing mechanisms. In particular, it is shown that the ODE system that describes the mean field limit of the occupancy measure process has a unique fixed point which is stable. This fixed point corresponds to a distribution on $\mathbb{N}_0$ of queue lengths with tails that decay super-exponentially. Upper and lower bounds on the decay rate are provided. Finally, we show that the unique invariant measure of the Markov occupancy measure process converges to the Dirac measure concentrated at the unique fixed point of the ODE system, establishing the interchangeability of the $t\to\infty$ and $n\to\infty$ limits.;math.PR
1801.02984;Cancellation of homothetic modules;Let R be a commutative ring, M an R-module, and N a finitely presented R-module such that the intersection of Max(R) and Supp(N) is finite-dimensional and Noetherian. Suppose also that N is homothetic, in other words, suppose that the natural ring homomorphism from R to the R-endomorphism ring of N is surjective. Working under these conditions, we describe various ways to guarantee the existence of a split surjective map in a specified coset of Hom(M,N). Using these results, we yield an extension of Bass's Cancellation Theorem that gives sufficient conditions for cancelling N or, more generally, a direct summand of a direct sum of finitely many copies of N. Since a canonical module of a Cohen-Macaulay ring is always finitely presented and homothetic, our work reveals a cancellation property of canonical modules of Cohen-Macaulay rings with finite-dimensional maximal spectra. Of note is that our results do not rely on any stable rank conditions.;math.AC
1801.02987;Multiplexing Analysis of Millimeter-Wave Massive MIMO Systems;This paper is concerned with spatial multiplexing analysis for millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive MIMO systems. For a single-user mmWave system employing distributed antenna subarray architecture in which the transmitter and receiver consist of Kt and Kr subarrays, respectively, an asymptotic multiplexing gain formula is firstly derived when the numbers of antennas at subarrays go to infinity. Specifically, assuming that all subchannels have the same average number of propagation paths L, the formula implies that by employing such a distributed antenna-subarray architecture, an exact average maximum multiplexing gain of KrKtL can be achieved. This result means that compared to the co-located antenna architecture, using the distributed antenna-subarray architecture can scale up the maximum multiplexing gain proportionally to KrKt. In order to further reveal the relation between diversity gain and multiplexing gain, a simple characterization of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff is also given. The multiplexing gain analysis is then extended to the multiuser scenario. Moreover, simulation results obtained with the hybrid analog/digital processing corroborate the analysis results.;cs.IT
1801.02988;Stability results for viscoelastic wave equation with dynamic boundary conditions;In this paper we consider wave viscoelastic equation with dynamic boundary condition in a bounded domain, we establish a general decay result of energy by exploiting the frequency domain method which consists in combining a contradiction argument and a special analysis for the resolvent of the operator of interest with assumptions on past history relaxation function.;math.AP
1801.02992;Blown-up intersection cochains and Deligne&#x27,s sheaves;In a series of papers the authors introduced the so-called blown-up intersection cochains. These cochains are suitable to study products and cohomology operations of intersection cohomology of stratified spaces. The aim of this paper is to prove that the sheaf versions of the functors of blown-up intersection cochains are realizations of Deligne's sheaves. This proves that Deligne's sheaves can be incarnated at the level of complexes of sheaves by soft sheaves of perverse differential graded algebras. We also study Poincar\'e and Verdier dualities of blown-up intersections sheaves with the use of Borel-Moore chains of intersection.;math.AT
1801.02993;Construction of the Poincare sheaf for higher genus curves;Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g$ and $L$ be a degree $l$ line bundle on $X$ with $l\geq 2g-1$. Denote the stack of rank two Higgs bundles on $X$ with value in $L$ by $\mathcal{H}iggs$ and the semistable part by $\mathcal{H}iggs_{ss}$. Let $H$ be the Hitchin base. In this paper we will construct the Poincare sheaf $\mathcal{P}$ on $\mathcal{H}iggs\times_{H}\mathcal{H}iggs_{ss}$ which is a maximal Cohen-Macaulay sheaf and flat over $\mathcal{H}iggs_{ss}$. In particular this includes the locus of nonreduced spectral curves.;math.AG
1801.02995;Cuspidal prehomogeneous vector spaces for reductive Lie groups and related algebraic and geometric structures;In this paper, we study the relations between left-invariant flat connections on Lie groups, left-symmetric algebras, symplective Lie algebras, Frobenius Lie algebras and cuspidal prehomogeneous vector spaces. More specifically, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between left-symmetric Lie algebras with a right identity and cuspidal prehomogeneous vector spaces of a Lie group. As an application of our approach, we study the classification of the reduced cuspidal prehomogeneous vector spaces (G,\r{ho},V) where G is a reductive Lie group. Fortunately, we prove that any of the left-symmetric structure on a reductive Lie algebra has a right identity. Then to give the complete classification of left-symmetric structure on reductive Lie algebras, we just need to give the classification of cuspidal prehomogeneous vector spaces for reductive Lie groups.;math.RT
1801.02996;Ascents in Non-Negative Lattice Paths;Non-negative {\L}ukasiewicz paths are special two-dimensional lattice paths never passing below their starting altitude which have only one single special type of down step. They are well-known and -studied combinatorial objects, in particular due to their bijective relation to trees with given node degrees. <br />We study the asymptotic behavior of the number of ascents (i.e., the number of maximal sequences of consecutive up steps) of given length for classical subfamilies of general non-negative {\L}ukasiewicz paths: those with arbitrary ending altitude, those ending on their starting altitude, and a variation thereof. Our results include precise asymptotic expansions for the expected number of such ascents as well as for the corresponding variance.;math.CO
1801.02997;Lagrangian torus fibration models of Fano threefolds;Inspired by the work of Gross on topological Mirror Symmetry we construct candidate Lagrangian torus fibration models for the 105 families of smooth Fano threefolds. We prove, in the case the second Betti number is one, that the total space of each fibration is homeomorphic to the expected Fano threefold, and show that the numerical invariants coincide for all 105. Our construction relies on a notion of toric degeneration for affine manifolds with singularities, and the correspondence we obtain between polytopes and Fano manifolds is compatible with that appearing in the work of Coates-Corti-Kasprzyk et al. on Mirror Symmetry for Fano manifolds.;math.GT
1801.02999;Exact asymptotics for a multi-timescale model, with applications in modeling overdispersed customer streams;In this paper we study the probability $\xi_n(u):={\mathbb P}\left(C_n\geqslant u n \right)$, with $C_n:=A(\psi_n B(\varphi_n))$ for L\'{e}vy processes $A(\cdot)$ and $B(\cdot)$, and $\varphi_n$ and $\psi_n$ non-negative sequences such that $\varphi_n \psi_n =n$ and $\varphi_n\to\infty$ as $n\to\infty$. Two timescale regimes are distinguished: a `fast' regime in which $\varphi_n$ is superlinear and a `slow' regime in which $\varphi_n$ is sublinear. We provide the exact asymptotics of $\xi_n(u)$ (as $n\to\infty$) for both regimes, relying on change-of-measure arguments in combination with Edgeworth-type estimates. The asymptotics have an unconventional form: the exponent contains the commonly observed linear term, but may also contain sublinear terms (the number of which depends on the precise form of $\varphi_n$ and $\psi_n$). To showcase the power of our results we include two examples, covering both the case where $C_n$ is lattice and non-lattice. Finally we present numerical experiments that demonstrate the importance of taking into account the doubly stochastic nature of $C_n$ in a practical application related to customer streams in service systems, they show that the asymptotic results obtained yield highly accurate approximations, also in scenarios in which there is no pronounced timescale separation.;math.PR
1801.03000;Some Properties of Kenmotsu Manifolds Admitting a Semi-symmetric Non-metric Connection;The aim of this paper is to study generalized recurrent, generalized Ricci-recurrent, weakly symmetric and weakly Ricci-symmetric Kenmotsu manifolds with respect to the semi-symmetric non-metric connection.;math.DG
1801.03004;Direct and inverse results on row sequences of simultaneous Pad&#xe9,-Faber approximants;Given a vector function ${\bf F}=(F_1,\ldots,F_d),$ analytic on a neighborhood of some compact subset $E$ of the complex plane with simply connected complement, we define a sequence of vector rational functions with common denominator in terms of the expansions of the components $F_k, k=1,\ldots,d,$ with respect to the sequence of Faber polynomials associated with $E$. Such sequences of vector rational functions are analogous to row sequences of type II Hermite-Pad\'e approximation. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence with geometric rate of the common denominators of the sequence of vector rational functions so constructed. The exact rate of convergence of these denominators is provided and the rate of convergence of the approximants is estimated. It is shown that the common denominators of the approximants detect the poles of the system of functions "closest" to $E$ and their order.;math.CV
1801.03005;On Self-Similar Lie Algebras and Virtual Endomorphisms;We introduce the notion of virtual endomorphisms of Lie algebras and use it as an approach for constructing self-similarity of Lie algebras. This is done in particular for a class of metabelian Lie algebras having homological type F Pn, which are variants of lamp-lighter groups. We establish several criteria when the existence of virtual endomorphism implies a self-similar Lie structure. Furthermore, we prove that the classical Lie algebra sln(k), where char(k) does not divide n affords non-trivial faithful self-similarity.;math.RA
1801.03008;Uniform Hausdorff dimension result for the inverse images of stable L&#xe9,vy processes;We establish a uniform Hausdorff dimension result for the inverse image sets of real-valued strictly $\alpha$-stable L\'evy processes with $1&lt, \alpha\le 2$. This extends a theorem of Kaufman for Brownian motion. Our method is different from that of Kaufman and depends on covering principles for Markov processes.;math.PR
1801.03013;Nonconvex Lagrangian-Based Optimization: Monitoring Schemes and Global Convergence;We introduce a novel approach addressing global analysis of a difficult class of nonconvex-nonsmooth optimization problems within the important framework of Lagrangian-based methods. This genuine nonlinear class captures many problems in modern disparate fields of applications. It features complex geometries, qualification conditions, and other regularity properties do not hold everywhere. To address these issues we work along several research lines to develop an original general Lagrangian methodology which can deal, all at once, with the above obstacles. A first innovative feature of our approach is to introduce the concept of Lagrangian sequences for a broad class of algorithms. Central to this methodology is the idea of turning an arbitrary descent method into a multiplier method. Secondly, we provide these methods with a transitional regime allowing us to identify in finitely many steps a zone where we can tune the step-sizes of the algorithm for the final converging regime. Then, despite the min-max nature of Lagrangian methods, using an original Lyapunov method we prove that each bounded sequence generated by the resulting monitoring schemes are globally convergent to a critical point for some fundamental Lagrangian-based methods in the broad semialgebraic setting, which to the best of our knowledge, are the first of this kind.;math.OC
1801.03014;On a Neumann problem for variational functionals of linear growth;We consider a Neumann problem for strictly convex variational functionals of linear growth. We establish the existence of minimisers among $\operatorname{W}^{1,1}$-functions provided that the domain under consideration is simply connected. Hence, in this situation, the relaxation of the functional to the space of functions of bounded variation, which has better compactness properties, is not necessary. Similar $\operatorname{W}^{1,1}$-regularity results for the corresponding Dirichlet problem are only known under rather restrictive convexity assumptions limiting its non-uniformity up to the borderline case of the minimal surface functional, whereas for the Neumann problem no such quantified version of strong convexity is required.;math.AP
1801.03016;Supersymmetric field theories from twisted vector bundles;We give a description of the delocalized twisted cohomology of an orbifold and the Chern character of a twisted vector bundle in terms of supersymmetric Euclidean field theories. This includes the construction of a twist functor for $1|1$-dimensional EFTs from the data of a gerbe with connection.;math.AT
1801.03017;Stochastic Optimization of Braking Energy Storage and Ventilation in a Subway Station;In the Paris subway system, stations represent about one third of the overall energy consumption. Within stations, ventilation is among the top consuming devices, it is operated at maximum airflow all day long, for air quality reasons. In this paper, we present a concept of energy system that displays comparable air quality while consuming much less energy. The system comprises a battery that makes it possible to recover the trains braking energy, arriving under the form of erratic and strong peaks. We propose an energy management system (EMS) that, at short time scale, controls energy flows and ventilation airflow. By using proper optimization algorithms, we manage to match supply with demand, while minimizing energy daily costs. For this purpose, we have designed algorithms that take into account the braking variability. They are based on the so-called Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) mathematical framework. We fairly compare SDP based algorithms with the widespread Model Predictive Control (MPC) ones. First, both SDP and MPC yield energy/money operating savings of the order of one third, compared to the current management without battery (our figure does not include the cost of the battery). Second, depending on the specific design, we observe that SDP outperforms MPC by a few percent, with an easier online numerical implementation.;math.OC
1801.03045;Slice regularity and harmonicity on Clifford algebras;We present some new relations between the Cauchy-Riemann operator on the real Clifford algebra $\mathbb R_n$ of signature $(0,n)$ and slice-regular functions on $\mathbb R_n$. The class of slice-regular functions, which comprises all polynomials with coefficients on one side, is the base of a recent function theory in several hypercomplex settings, including quaternions and Clifford algebras. In this paper we present formulas, relating the Cauchy-Riemann operator, the spherical Dirac operator, the differential operator characterizing slice regularity, and the {spherical derivative} of a slice function. The computation of the Laplacian of the spherical derivative of a slice regular function gives a result which implies, in particular, the Fueter-Sce Theorem. In the two four-dimensional cases represented by the paravectors of $\mathbb R_3$ and by the space of quaternions, these results are related to zonal harmonics on the three-dimensional sphere and to the Poisson kernel of the unit ball of $\mathbb R^4$.;math.CV
1801.03047;Invariant metrics on central extensions of Quadratic Lie algebras;A quadratic Lie algebra is a Lie algebra endowed with a symmetric, invariant and non degenerate bilinear form, such a bilinear form is called an invariant metric. The aim of this work is to describe the general structure of those central extensions of quadratic Lie algebras which in turn have invariantmetrics. The structure is such that the central extensions can be described algebraically in terms of the original quadratic Lie algebra, and geometrically in terms of the direct sum decompositions that the invariant metrics involvedgive rise to.;math.RA
1801.03048;Placement Delivery Array Design for Combination Networks with Edge Caching;A major practical limitation of the Maddah-Ali-Niesen coded caching techniques is their high subpacketization level. For the simple network with a single server and multiple users, Yan \emph{et al.} proposed an alternative scheme with the so-called placement delivery arrays (PDA). Such a scheme requires slightly higher transmission rates but significantly reduces the subpacketization level. In this paper, we extend the PDA framework and propose three low-subpacketization schemes for combination networks, i.e., networks with a single server, multiple relays, and multiple cache-aided users that are connected to subsets of relays. One of the schemes achieves the cutset lower bound on the link rate when the cache memories are sufficiently large. Our other two schemes apply only to \emph{resolvable} combination networks. For these networks and for a wide range of cache sizes, the new schemes perform closely to the coded caching schemes that directly apply Maddah-Ali-Niesen scheme while having significantly reduced subpacketization levels.;cs.IT
1801.03053;Generalized Toda flows;The classical hierarchy of Toda flows can be thought of as an action of the (abelian) group of polynomials on Jacobi matrices. We present a generalization of this to the larger groups of $C^2$ and entire functions, and in this second case, we also introduce associated cocycles and in fact give center stage to this object.;math.SP
1801.03054;Betti numbers of Bresinsky&#x27,s curves in $\mathbb{A}^{4}$;Bresinsky defined a class of monomial curves in $\mathbb{A}^{4}$ with the property that the minimal number of generators or the first Betti number of the defining ideal is unbounded above. We prove that the same behaviour of unboundedness is true for all the Betti numbers and construct an explicit minimal free resolution for this class.;math.AC
1801.03055;Deconvolving RNA Base Pairing Signals;A growing number of RNA sequences are now known to have distributions of multiple stable sequences. Recent algorithms use the list of nucleotides in a sequence and auxiliary experimental data to predict such distributions. Although the algorithms are largely successful in identifying a distribution's constituent structures, it remains challenging to recover their relative weightings. In this paper, we quantify this issue using a total variation distance. Then, we prove under a Nussinov-Jacobson model that a large proportion of RNA structure pairs cannot be jointly reconstructed with low total variation distance. Finally, we characterize the uncertainty in predicting conformational ratios by analyzing the amount of information in the auxiliary data.;math.CO
1801.03056;Discriminant-Stability in $p$-adic Lie Towers of Number Fields;In this paper we consider a tower of number fields $\cdots \supseteq K(1) \supseteq K(0) \supseteq K$ arising naturally from a continuous $p$-adic representation of $\mathrm{Gal}(\bar{\mathbb{Q}}/K)$, referred to as a $p$-adic Lie tower over $K$. A recent conjecture of Daqing Wan hypothesizes, for certain $p$-adic Lie towers of curves over $\mathbb{F}_p$, a stable (polynomial) growth formula for the genus. Here we prove the analogous result in characteristic zero, namely: the $p$-adic valuation of the discriminant of the extension $K(i)/K$ is given by a polynomial in $i,p^i$ for $i$ sufficiently large. This generalizes a previously known result on discriminant-growth in $\mathbb{Z}_p$-towers of local fields of characteristic zero.;math.NT
1801.03057;Galois gerbs and Lefschetz number formula for Shimura varieties of Hodge type;For any Shimura variety of Hodge type with hyperspecial level at a prime $p$ and a lisse sheaf on it, we prove a formula, conjectured by Kottwitz \cite{Kottwitz90}, for the Lefschetz number of an arbitrary Frobenius-twisted Hecke correspondence acting on the compactly supported \'etale cohomology and verify another conjecture of Kottwitz \cite{Kottwitz90} on the stabilization of that formula. The main ingredients of our proof of the formula are a recent work of Kisin \cite{Kisin17} on Langlands-Rapoport conjecture and the theory of Galois gerbs developed by Langlands and Rapoport \cite{LR87}. Especially, we use the Galois gerb theory to establish an effectivity criterion of Kottwitz triple, and mimic the arguments of Langlands and Rapoport of deriving the Kottwitz formula from their conjectural description of the $\Fpb$-point set of Shimura variety (Langlands-Rapoport conjecture). We do not assume that the derived group is simply connected, and also obtain partial results at (special) parahoric levels under some condition at $p$. For that, in the first part of our work we extend the results of Langlands and Rapoport to such general cases.;math.NT
1801.03061;Secure Communication over 1-2-1 Networks;This paper starts by assuming a 1-2-1 network, the abstracted noiseless model of mmWave networks that was shown to closely approximate the Gaussian capacity in [1], and studies secure communication. First, the secure capacity is derived for 1-2-1 networks where a source is connected to a destination through a network of unit capacity links. Then, lower and upper bounds on the secure capacity are derived for the case when source and destination have more than one beam, which allow them to transmit and receive in multiple directions at a time. Finally, secure capacity results are presented for diamond 1-2-1 networks when edges have different capacities.;cs.IT
1801.03066;Capacity Results for Intermittent X-Channels with Delayed Channel State Feedback;We characterize the capacity region of noiseless X-Channels with intermittent connectivity and delayed channel state information at the transmitters. We consider the general case in which each transmitter has a common message for both receivers, and a private message for each one of them. We develop a new set of outer-bounds that quantify the interference alignment capability of each transmitter with delayed channel state feedback and when each receiver must receive a baseline entropy corresponding to the common message. We also develop a transmission strategy that achieves the outer-bounds under homogeneous channel assumption by opportunistically treating the X-Channel as a combination of a number of well-known problems such as the interference channel and the multicast channel. The capacity-achieving strategies of these sub-problems must be interleaved and carried on simultaneously in certain regimes in order to achieve the X-Channel outer-bounds. We also extend the outer-bounds to include non-homogeneous channel parameters.;cs.IT
1801.03067;On statistical models on super trees;We consider a particular example of interplay between statistical models related to CFT on one hand, and to the spectral properties of ODE, known as ODE/IS correspondence, on the other hand. We focus at the representation of wave functions of Schr\"odinger operators in terms of spectral properties of associated transfer matrices on "super trees" (the trees whose vertex degree changes with the distance from the root point). Such trees with varying branchings encode the structure of the Fock space of the model. We discuss basic spectral properties of "averaged random matrix ensembles" in terms of Hermite polynomials for the transfer matrix of super trees. At small "branching velocities" we have related the problem of paths counting on super trees to the statistics of area-weighted one-dimensional Dyck paths. We also discuss the connection of the spectral statistics of random walks on super trees with the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang scaling.;math-ph
1801.03070;On Frobenius semisimplicity in Hida families;Let $p\geq 5$ be a prime and $\ell\neq p$ be a prime not dividing the tame level of a $p$-ordinary Hida family. We prove that the actions of the Frobenius element at $\ell$ on the Galois representations attached to almost all arithmetic specializations are semisimple and non-scalar. If $k_f$ denotes the weight of a cusp form $f(z)= \sum_{n\geq 1} a_\ell(f) e^{2\pi i n z}$, then the inequality $$|a_\ell(f) | \leq 2 \ell^{(k_f-1)/2},$$ predicted by the Ramanujan conjecture, is a strict inequality for almost all members $f$ of the family.;math.NT
1801.03072;A one-phase interior point method for nonconvex optimization;The work of Wachter and Biegler suggests that infeasible-start interior point methods (IPMs) developed for linear programming cannot be adapted to nonlinear optimization without significant modification, i.e., using a two-phase or penalty method. We propose an IPM that, by careful initialization and updates of the slack variables, is guaranteed to find a first-order certificate of local infeasibility, local optimality or unboundedness of the (shifted) feasible region. Our proposed algorithm differs from other IPM methods for nonconvex programming because we reduce primal feasibility at the same rate as the barrier parameter. This gives an algorithm with more robust convergence properties and closely resembles successful algorithms from linear programming. We implement the algorithm and compare with IPOPT on a subset of CUTEst problems. Our algorithm requires a similar median number of iterations, but fails on only 9% of the problems compared with 16% for IPOPT. Experiments on infeasible variants of the CUTEst problems indicate superior performance for detecting infeasibility. <br />The code for our implementation can be found at <a href="https://github.com/ohinder/OnePhase">this https URL</a> .;math.OC
1801.03078;A converse to Schreier&#x27,s index-rank formula;In "Subgroups of free profinite groups and large subfields of Q" (Israel J. Math. 39 (1981), no. 1-2, pages 25-45, MR 617288) A. Lubotzky and L. van den Dries raise the question whether a finitely generated, residually finite group is necessarily free if the rank function on its subgroups of finite index satisfies Schreier's well-known index rank relation (see Question 2 on p. 34). I answered this question in 1980 but, so far, I have not published my answer. This note fills the omission, it gives an amended and abridged version of my original proof.;math.GR
1801.03079;Asymmetry Hurts: Private Information Retrieval Under Asymmetric Traffic Constraints;We consider the classical setting of private information retrieval (PIR) of a single message (file) out of $M$ messages from $N$ distributed databases under the new constraint of \emph{asymmetric traffic} from databases. In this problem, the \emph{ratios between the traffic} from the databases are constrained, i.e., the ratio of the length of the answer string that the user (retriever) receives from the $n$th database to the total length of all answer strings from all databases is constrained to be $\tau_n$. This may happen if the user's access to the databases is restricted due database availability, channel quality to the databases, and other factors. For this problem, for fixed $M$, $N$, we develop a general upper bound $\bar{C}(\boldsymbol{\tau})$, which generalizes the converse proof of Sun-Jafar, where database symmetry was inherently used. Our converse bound is a piece-wise affine function in the traffic ratio vector $\boldsymbol{\tau}=(\tau_1, \cdots, \tau_N)$. For the lower bound, we explicitly show the achievability of $\binom{M+N-1}{M}$ corner points. For the remaining traffic ratio vectors, we perform time-sharing between these corner points. The recursive structure of our achievability scheme is captured via a system of difference equations. The upper and lower bounds exactly match for $M=2$ and $M=3$ for any $N$ and any $\boldsymbol{\tau}$. The results show strict loss of PIR capacity due to the asymmetric traffic constraints compared with the symmetric case of Sun-Jafar which implicitly uses $\tau_n=\frac{1}{N}$ for all $n$.;cs.IT
1801.03081;A proof of Bertrand&#x27,s theorem using the theory of isochronous potentials;We give an alternative proof for the celebrated Bertrand's theorem as a corollary of the isochronicity of a certain family of centers.;math.DS
1801.03082;Rational points and prime values of polynomials in moderately many variables;We derive the Hasse principle and weak approximation for pencils of certain varieties in the spirit of work by Colliot-Th\'el\`ene,Sansuc and Harpaz-Skorobogatov-Wittenberg. Our varieties are defined through polynomials in many variables and part of our work is devoted to establishing Schinzel's hypothesis for polynomials of this kind. This last part is achieved by using arguments behind Birch's well-known result regarding the Hasse principle for complete intersections with the notable difference that we prove our result in 50% fewer variables than in the classical Birch setting. We also study the problem of square-free values of an integer polynomial with 66.6% fewer variables than in the Birch setting.;math.NT
1801.03083;Smoluchowski&#x27,s discrete coagulation equation with forcing;In this article we study an extension of Smoluchowski's discrete coagulation equation, where particle in- and output takes place. This model is frequently used to describe aggregation processes in combination with sedimentation of clusters. More precisely, we show that the evolution equation is well-posed for a large class of coagulation kernels and output rates. Additionally, in the long-time limit we prove that solutions converge to a unique equilibrium with exponential rate under a suitable smallness condition on the coefficients.;math-ph
1801.03109;An operator-valued Lyapunov theorem;We generalize Lyapunov's convexity theorem for classical (scalar-valued) measures to quantum (operator-valued) measures. In particular, we show that the range of a nonatomic quantum probability measure is a weak*-closed convex set of quantum effects (positive operators bounded above by the identity operator) under a sufficient condition on the non-injectivity of integration. To prove the operator-valued version of Lyapunov's theorem, we must first define the notions of essentially bounded, essential support, and essential range for quantum random variables (Borel measurable functions from a set to the bounded linear operators acting on a Hilbert space).;math.FA
1801.03112;Fundamental Solutions and Decay of Fully Non-local Problems;In this paper, we study a fully non-local reaction-diffusion equation which is non-local both in time and space. We apply subordination principles to construct the fundamental solutions of this problem, which we use to find a representation of the mild solutions. Moreover, using techniques of Harmonic Analysis and Fourier Multipliers, we obtain the temporal decay rates for the mild solutions.;math.AP
1801.03116;Existence and continuity of solution trajectories of generalized equations with application in electronics;We consider a special form of parametric generalized equations arising from electronic circuits with AC sources and study the effect of perturbing the input signal on solution trajectories. Using methods of variational analysis and strong metric regularity property of an auxiliary map, we are able to prove the regularity properties of the solution trajectories inherited by the input signal. Furthermore, we establish the existence of continuous solution trajectories for the perturbed problem. This can be achieved via a result of uniform strong metric regularity for the auxiliary map. <br />Key words and phrases: generalized equations, electronic circuits, strong metric regularity, uniform strong metric regularity, perturbations.;math.OC
1801.03120;Limiting curves for the dyadic odometer and the generalized Trollope-Delange formula;We study limiting curves resulting from deviations in partial sums in the ergodic theorem for the dyadic odometer and non-cylindric functions. In particular, we generalize the Trollope-Delange formula for the case of the weighted sum-of-binary-digits function and show that the Takagi-Landsberg curve arises.;math.DS
1801.03122;A detailed treatment of Doob&#x27,s theorem;Doob's theorem provides guarantees of consistent estimation and posterior consistency under very general conditions. Despite the limitation that it only guarantees consistency on a set with prior probability 1, for many models arising in practice, Doob's theorem is an easy way of showing that consistency will hold almost everywhere. In this article, we give a detailed proof of Doob's theorem.;math.ST
1801.03123;Level-dependent interpolatory Hermite subdivision schemes and wavelets;We study many properties of level-dependent Hermite subdivision, focusing on schemes preserving polynomial and exponential data. We specifically consider interpolatory schemes, which give rise to level-dependent multiresolution analyses through a prediction-correction approach. A result on the decay of the associated multiwavelet coefficients, corresponding to a uniformly continuous and differentiable function, is derived. It makes use of the approximation of any such function with a generalized Taylor formula expressed in terms of polynomials and exponentials.;math.NA
1801.03134;On a $q$-analogue of the number of representations of an integer as a sum of two squares;Kassel and Reutenauer \cite{kassel2016fourier} introduced a $q$-analogue of the number of representations of an integer as a sum of two squares. We establish some connections between the prime factorization of $n$ and the coefficients of this $q$-analogue.;math.NT
1801.03142;Topological freeness for $C^*$-correspondences;We study conditions that ensure uniqueness theorems of Cuntz-Krieger type for relative Cuntz-Pimsner algebras $\mathcal{O}(J,X)$ associated to a $C^*$-correspondence $X$ over a $C^*$-algebra $A$. We give general sufficient conditions phrased in terms of a multivalued map $\widehat{X}$ acting on the spectrum $\widehat{A}$ of $A$. When $X(J)$ is of Type I we construct a directed graph dual to $X$ and prove a uniqueness theorem using this graph. When $X(J)$ is liminal, we show that topological freeness of this graph is equivalent to the uniqueness property for $\mathcal{O}(J,X)$, as well as to an algebraic condition, which we call $J$-acyclicity of $X$. <br />As an application we improve the Fowler-Raeburn uniqueness theorem for the Toeplitz algebra $\mathcal{T}_X$. We give new simplicity criteria for $\mathcal{O}_X$. We generalize and enhance uniqueness results for relative quiver $C^*$-algebras of Muhly and Tomforde. We also discuss applications to crossed products by endomorphisms.;math.OA
1801.03144;Reconstruction of piecewise smooth wave speeds using multiple scattering;Let $c$ be a piecewise smooth wave speed on $\mathbb R^n$, unknown inside a domain $\Omega$. We are given the solution operator for the scalar wave equation $(\partial_t^2-c^2\Delta)u=0$, but only outside $\Omega$ and only for initial data supported outside $\Omega$. Using our recently developed scattering control method, we prove that piecewise smooth wave speeds are uniquely determined by this map, and provide a reconstruction formula. In other words, the wave imaging problem is solvable in the piecewise smooth setting under mild conditions. We also illustrate a separate method, likewise constructive, for recovering the locations of interfaces in broken geodesic normal coordinates using scattering control.;math.AP
1801.03151;Domain-dependent stability analysis and parameter classification of a reaction-diffusion model on spherical geometries;In this work an activator-depleted reaction-diffusion system is investigated on polar coordinates with the aim of exploring the relationship and the corresponding influence of domain size on the types of possible diffusion-driven instabilities. Quantitative relationships are found in the form of necessary conditions on the area of a disk-shape domain with respect to the diffusion and reaction rates for certain types of diffusion-driven instabilities to occur. Robust analytical methods are applied to find explicit expressions for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the diffusion operator on a disk-shape domain with homogenous Neumann boundary conditions in polar coordinates. Spectral methods are applied using chebyshev non-periodic grid for the radial variable and Fourier periodic grid on the angular variable to verify the nodal lines and eigen-surfaces subject to the proposed analytical findings. The full classification of the parameter space in light of the bifurcation analysis is obtained and numerically verified by finding the solutions of the partitioning curves inducing such a classification. Furthermore, analytical results are found relating the area of (disk-shape) domain with reaction-diffusion rates in the form of necessary conditions for the different types of bifurcations. These results are on one hand presented in the form of mathematical theorems with rigorous proofs, and, on the other hand using finite element method, each claim of the corresponding theorems are verified by obtaining the theoretically predicted behaviour of the dynamics in the numerical simulations.;math.DS
1801.03152;Invariant measures for the periodic derivative nonlinear Schr&#xf6,dinger equation;We construct invariant measures associated to the integrals of motion of the periodic derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (DNLS) for small data in $L^2$ and we show these measures to be absolutely continuous with respect to the Gaussian measure. The key ingredient of the proof is the analysis of the gauge group of transformations associated to DNLS. As an intermediate step for our main result, we prove quasi-invariance with respect to the gauge maps of Gaussian measures on $L^2$.;math-ph
1801.03153;A New Coding Paradigm for the Primitive Relay Channel;We consider the primitive relay channel, where the source sends a message to the relay and to the destination, and the relay helps the communication by transmitting an additional message to the destination via a separate channel. Two well-known coding techniques have been introduced for this setting: decode-and-forward and compress-and-forward. In decode-and-forward, the relay completely decodes the message and sends some information to the destination, in compress-and-forward, the relay does not decode, and it sends a compressed version of the received signal to the destination using Wyner-Ziv coding. In this paper, we present a novel coding paradigm that provides an improved achievable rate for the primitive relay channel. The idea is to combine compress-and-forward and decode-and-forward via a chaining construction. We transmit over pairs of blocks: in the first block, we use compress-and-forward, and in the second block, we use decode-and-forward. More specifically, in the first block, the relay does not decode, it compresses the received signal via Wyner-Ziv, and it sends only part of the compression to the destination. In the second block, the relay completely decodes the message, it sends some information to the destination, and it also sends the remaining part of the compression coming from the first block. By doing so, we are able to strictly outperform both compress-and-forward and decode-and-forward. Note that the proposed coding scheme can be implemented with polar codes. As such, it has the typical attractive properties of polar coding schemes, namely, quasi-linear encoding and decoding complexity, and error probability that decays at super-polynomial speed. As a running example, we take into account the special case of the erasure relay channel, and we provide a comparison between the rates achievable by our proposed scheme and the existing upper and lower bounds.;cs.IT
1801.03163;Sufficient Conditions for the Tightness of Shannon&#x27,s Capacity Bounds for Two-Way Channels;New sufficient conditions for determining in closed form the capacity region of point-to-point memoryless two-way channels (TWCs) are derived. The proposed conditions not only relax Shannon's condition which can identify only TWCs with a certain symmetry property but also generalize other existing results. Examples are given to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed conditions.;cs.IT
1801.03165;Algebraic differential formulas for the shuffle, stuffle and duality relations of iterated integrals;In this paper we prove certain algebraic identities, which correspond to differentiations of the shuffle relation, the stuffle relation, and the relations which arise from M\"obius transformations of iterated integrals. These formulas provide fundamental and useful tools in the study of iterated integrals on a punctured projective line.;math.NT
1801.03172;Optimal Allocation of Series FACTS Devices in Large Scale Systems;Series FACTS devices, such as the variable series reactor (VSR), have the ability to continuously regulate the transmission line reactance so as to control power flow. This paper presents a new approach to optimally locating such devices in the transmission network considering multiple operating states and contingencies. To investigate optimal investment, a single target year planning with three different load patterns is considered. The transmission contingencies may occur under any of the three load conditions and the coupling constraints between base case and contingencies are included. A reformulation technique transforms the original mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model into mixed integer linear programing (MILP) model. To further relieve the computational burden and enable the planning model to be directly applied to practical large scale systems, a two phase decomposition algorithm is introduced. Detailed numerical simulation results on IEEE 118-bus system and the Polish 2383-bus system illustrate the efficient performance of the proposed algorithm.;math.OC

1801.03185;A Gaussian process framework for overlap and causal effect estimation with high-dimensional covariates;A powerful tool for the analysis of nonrandomized observational studies has been the potential outcomes model. Utilization of this framework allows analysts to estimate average treatment effects. This article considers the situation in which high-dimensional covariates are present and revisits the standard assumptions made in causal inference. We show that by employing a flexible Gaussian process framework, the assumption of strict overlap leads to very restrictive assumptions about the distribution of covariates, results for which can be characterized using classical results from Gaussian random measures as well as reproducing kernel Hilbert space theory. In addition, we propose a strategy for data-adaptive causal effect estimation that does not rely on the strict overlap assumption. These findings reveal the stringency that accompanies the use of the treatment positivity assumption in high-dimensional settings.;math.ST
1801.03186;Measure-valued spline curves: an optimal transport viewpoint;The aim of this article is to introduce and address the problem to smoothly interpolate (empirical) probability measures.

1801.03187;Choreographies in the Discrete Nonlinear Schr&#xf6,dinger Equations;We study periodic solutions of the discrete nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (DNLSE) that bifurcate from a symmetric polygonal relative equilibrium containing $n$ sites. With specialized numerical continuation techniques and a varying physically relevant parameter we can locate interesting orbits, including infinitely many choreographies. Many of the orbits that correspond to choreographies are stable, as indicated by Floquet multipliers that are extracted as part of the numerical continuation scheme, and as verified \textit{a posteriori} by simple numerical integration. We discuss the physical relevance and the implications of our results.;math.DS
1801.03189;A program for finding all KMS states on the Toeplitz algebra of a higher-rank graph;The Toeplitz algebra of a finite graph of rank $k$ carries a natural action of the torus ${\mathbb T}^k$, and composing with an embedding of ${\mathbb R}$ in ${\mathbb T}^k$ gives a dynamics on the Toeplitz algebra. For inverse temperatures larger than a critical value, the KMS states for this dynamics are well-understood, and this analysis is the first step in our program. At the critical inverse temperature, much less is known, and the second step in our program is an analysis of the KMS states at the critical value. This is the main technical contribution of the present paper. The third step shows that the problem of finding the states at inverse temperatures less than the critical value is equivalent to our original problem for a smaller graph. Then we can tackle this new problem using the same three steps, and repeat if necessary. So in principle, modulo some mild connectivity conditions on the graph, our results give a complete description of the simplex of KMS states at all inverse temperatures. We test our program on a wide range of examples, including a very general family of graphs with three strongly connected components.;math.OA

1801.03195;The Hypotheses on Expansion of Iterated Stratonovich Stochastic Integrals of Arbitrary Multiplicity and Their Partial Proof;In this review article we collected more than ten theorems on expansions of iterated Ito and Stratonovich stochastic integrals, which have been formulated and proved by the author. These theorems open a new direction for study of iterated Ito and Stratonovich stochastic integrals. The expansions based on multiple and iterated Fourier-Legendre series as well as on multiple and iterated trigonomectic Fourier series converging in the mean and pointwise are presented in the article. Some of these theorems are connected with the iterated stochastic integrals of multiplicities 1 to 5. Also we consider two theorems on expansions of iterated Ito stochastic integrals of arbitrary multiplicity $k$ $(k\in\mathbb{N})$ based on generalized multiple Fourier series converging in the sense of norm in Hilbert space $L_2([t, T]^k)$ as well as two theorems on expansions of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of arbitrary multiplicity $k$ $(k\in\mathbb{N})$ based on generalized iterated Fourier series converging pointwise. On the base of the presented theorems we formulate 3 hypotheses on expansions of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of arbitrary multiplicity $k$ $(k\in\mathbb{N})$ based on generalized multiple Fourier series converging in the sense of norm in Hilbert space $L_2([t, T]^k).$ The mentioned iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals are part of the Taylor-Stratonovich expansion. Moreover, the considered expansions of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals from these 3 hypotheses contain only one operation of the limit transition and substantially simpler than their analogues for iterated Ito stochastic integrals. Therefore, the results of the article can be useful for solution of the problem of numerical integration of Ito stochastic differential equations.;math.PR
1801.03197;On the Generalized Hardy-Rellich Inequalities;In this article, we look for the weight functions (say $g$) that admits the following generalized Hardy-Rellich type inequality: $ \int_{\Omega} g(x) u^2 dx \leq C \int_{\Omega} |\Delta u|^2 dx, \forall u \in \mathcal{D}^{2,2}_0(\Omega), $ for some constant $C&gt,0$, where $\Omega$ is an open set in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with $N\ge 1$. We find various classes of such weight functions, depending on the dimension $N$ and the geometry of $\Omega.$ Firstly, we use the Muckenhoupt condition for the one dimensional weighted Hardy inequalities and a symmetrization inequality to obtain admissible weights in certain Lorentz-Zygmund spaces. Secondly, using the fundamental theorem of integration we obtain the weight functions in certain weighted Lebesgue spaces. As a consequence of our results, we obtain simple proofs for the embeddings of $\mathcal{D}^{2,2}_0(\Omega)$ into certain Lorentz-Zygmund spaces proved by Hansson and later by Brezis and Wainger.;math.AP
1801.03198;Plane curves possessing two outer Galois points;We classify plane curves $\mathcal{C}$ possessing two Galois points $P_1$ and $P_2 \in \mathbb{P}^2 \setminus \mathcal{C}$ such that the associated Galois groups $G_{P_1}$ and $G_{P_2}$ generate the semidirect product $G_{P_1}\rtimes G_{P_2}$. In particular, a new characterization of Fermat curves is presented.;math.AG
1801.03203;A global maximum principle for optimal control of general mean-field forward-backward stochastic systems with jumps;In this paper we prove a necessary condition of the optimal control problem for a class of general mean-field forward-backward stochastic systems with jumps in the case where the diffusion coefficients depend on control, the control set does not need to be convex, the coefficients of jump terms are independent of control as well as the coefficients of mean-field backward stochastic differential equations depend on the joint law of $(X(t),Y(t))$. Two new adjoint equations are brought in as well as several new generic estimates of their solutions are investigated for analysing the higher terms, especially, those involving the expectation which come from the derivatives of the coefficients with respect to the measure. Utilizing these subtle estimates, the second-order expansion of the cost functional, which is the key point to analyse the necessary condition, is obtained, and whereafter the stochastic maximum principle.;math.OC
1801.03205;A Cantor set whose polynomial hull contains no analytic discs;A generalization of a result of Wermer concerning the existence of polynomial hulls without analytic discs is presented.

1801.03212;Sparse Isotropic Regularization for Spherical Harmonic Representations of Random Fields on the Sphere;This paper discusses sparse isotropic regularization for a random field on the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, where the field is expanded in terms of a spherical harmonic basis. A key feature is that the norm used in the regularization term, a hybrid of the $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_2$-norms, is chosen so that the regularization preserves isotropy, in the sense that if the observed random field is strongly isotropic then so too is the regularized field. The Pareto efficient frontier is used to display the trade-off between the sparsity-inducing norm and the data discrepancy term, in order to help in the choice of a suitable regularization parameter. A numerical example using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data is considered in detail. In particular, the numerical results explore the trade-off between regularization and discrepancy, and show that substantial sparsity can be achieved along with small $L_{2}$ error.;math.NA
1801.03214;Scattering and inverse scattering for nonlinear quantum walks;We study large time behavior of quantum walks (QWs) with self-dependent (nonlinear) coin. In particular, we show scattering and derive the reproducing formula for inverse scattering in the weak nonlinear regime. The proof is based on space-time estimate of (linear) QWs such as dispersive estimates and Strichartz estimate. Such argument is standard in the study of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations and discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations but it seems to be the first time to be applied to QW.;math-ph
1801.03215;The cycle structure of unicritical polynomials;A polynomial with integer coefficients yields a family of dynamical systems indexed by primes as follows: for any prime $p$, reduce its coefficients mod $p$ and consider its action on the field $\mathbb{F}_p$. The questions of whether and in what sense these families are random have been studied extensively, spurred in part by Pollard's famous "rho" algorithm for integer factorization (the heuristic justification of which is the randomness of one such family). However, the cycle structure of these families cannot be random, since in any such family, the number of cycles of a fixed length in any dynamical system in the family is bounded. In this paper, we show that the cycle statistics of many of these families are as random as possible. As a corollary, we show that most members of these families have many cycles, addressing a conjecture of Mans et. al.;math.DS
1801.03216;A counterexample to De Pierro&#x27,s conjecture on the convergence of under-relaxed cyclic projections;The convex feasibility problem consists in finding a point in the intersection of a finite family of closed convex sets. When the intersection is empty, a best compromise is to search for a point that minimizes the sum of the squared distances to the sets. In 2001, de Pierro conjectured that the limit cycles generated by the $\varepsilon$-under-relaxed cyclic projection method converge when $\varepsilon\downarrow 0$ towards a least squares solution. While the conjecture has been confirmed under fairly general conditions, we show that it is false in general by constructing a system of three compact convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$ for which the $\varepsilon$-under-relaxed cycles do not converge.;math.OC
1801.03217;Reduced critical processes for small populations;Let $\left\{ Z(n),n\geq 1\right\} $ be a critical Galton-Watson branching process with finite variance for the offspring size of particles. Assuming that $0&lt,Z(n)\leq \varphi (n)$, where either $\varphi (n)=an$ for some $a&gt,0$ or $\varphi (n)=o(n)$ as $n\rightarrow \infty $, we study the structure of the process $% \left\{ Z(m,n),0\leq m\leq n\right\} ,$ where $Z(m,n)$ is the number of particles in the process at moment $m\leq n$ having a positive number of descendants at moment $n$.;math.PR
1801.03221;Compatible systems and ramification;We show that compatible systems of $\ell$-adic sheaves on a scheme of finite type over the ring of integers of a local field are compatible along the boundary up to stratification. This extends a theorem of Deligne on curves over a finite field. As an application, we deduce the equicharacteristic case of classical conjectures on $\ell$-independence for proper smooth varieties over complete discrete valuation fields. Moreover, we show that compatible systems have compatible ramification. We also prove an analogue for integrality along the boundary.;math.AG
1801.03229;Fixed points of automorphisms of certain non-cyclic $p$-groups and the dihedral group;Let $G=\mathbf{Z}_{p} \oplus \mathbf{Z}_{p^2}$, where $p$ is a prime number. Suppose that $d$ is a divisor of the order of $G$. In this paper we find the number of automorphisms of $G$ fixing $d$ elements of $G$, and denote it by $\theta(G,d)$. As a consequence, we prove a conjecture of Checco-Darling-Longfield-Wisdom. We also find the exact number of fixed-point-free automorphisms of the group $\mathbf{Z}_{p^{a}} \oplus \mathbf{Z}_{p^{b}}$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers with $a&lt,b$. Finally, we compute $\theta(D_{2q},d)$, where $D_{2q}$ is the dihedral group of order $2q$, $q$ is an odd prime and $d \in \{1,q,2q\}$.;math.GR
1801.03232;$U(\fh)$-free modules over the Block algebra $\BB(q)$;In this paper, we construct a new class of modules over the Block algebra $\BB(q)$, where $q$ is a nonzero complex number. We determined the irreducibilities of these modules and the isomorphisms among them.;math.RT
1801.03234;Optimal linear responses for Markov chains and stochastically perturbed dynamical systems;The linear response of a dynamical system refers to changes to properties of the system when small external perturbations are applied. We consider the little-studied question of selecting an optimal perturbation so as to (i) maximise the linear response of the equilibrium distribution of the system, (ii) maximise the linear response of the expectation of a specified observable, and (iii) maximise the linear response of the rate of convergence of the system to the equilibrium distribution. We also consider the inhomogeneous or time-dependent situation where the governing dynamics is not stationary and one wishes to select a sequence of small perturbations so as to maximise the overall linear response at some terminal time. We develop the theory for finite-state Markov chains, provide explicit solutions for some illustrative examples, and numerically apply our theory to stochastically perturbed dynamical systems, where the Markov chain is replaced by a matrix representation of an approximate annealed transfer operator for the random dynamical system.;math.DS
1801.03235;Combating Error Propagation in Window Decoding of Braided Convolutional Codes;In this paper, we study sliding window decoding of braided convolutional codes (BCCs) in the context of a streaming application, where decoder error propagation can be a serious problem. A window extension algorithm and a resynchronization mechanism are introduced to mitigate the effect of error propagation. In addition, we introduce a soft bit-error-rate stopping rule to reduce computational complexity, and the tradeoff between performance and complexity is examined. Simulation results show that, using the proposed window extension algorithm and resynchronization mechanism, the error performance of BCCs can be improved by up to three orders of magnitude with reduced computational complexity.;cs.IT

On the latter, we construct invariant distributions and thus fill a gap in the literature by giving infinitely many linearly independent triple products of induced representations.;math.RT
1801.03255;When Exploiting Individual User Preference Is Beneficial for Caching at Base Stations;Most of prior works optimize caching policies based on the following assumptions: 1) every user initiates request according to content popularity, 2) all users are with the same active level, and 3) users are uniformly located in the considered region. In practice, these assumptions are often not true. In this paper, we explore the benefit of optimizing caching policies for base stations by exploiting user preference considering the spatial locality and different active level of users. We obtain optimal caching policies, respectively minimizing the download delay averaged over all file requests and user locations in the network (namely network average delay), and minimizing the maximal weighted download delay averaged over the file requests and location of each user (namely maximal weighted user average delay), as well as minimizing the weighted sum of both. The analysis and simulation results show that exploiting heterogeneous user preference and active level can improve user fairness, and can also improve network performance when users are with spatial locality.;cs.IT
1801.03258;Exploiting structure of chance constrained programs via submodularity;We introduce a novel approach to reduce the computational effort of solving mixed-integer convex chance constrained programs through the scenario approach. Instead of reducing the number of required scenarios, we directly minimize the computational cost of the scenario program. We exploit the problem structure by efficiently partitioning the constraint function and considering a multiple chance constrained program that gives the same probabilistic guarantees as the original single chance constrained problem. We formulate the problem of finding the optimal partition, a partition achieving the lowest computational cost, as an optimization problem with nonlinear objective and combinatorial constraints. By using submodularity of the support rank of a set of constraints, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm to find suboptimal solutions to this partitioning problem and we give approximation guarantees for special classes of cost metrics. We illustrate that the resulting computational cost savings can be arbitrarily large and demonstrate our approach on two case studies from production and multi-agent planning.;math.OC
1801.03259;Asymptotically Optimal Scheduling for Compute-and-Forward;Consider a Compute and Forward (CF) relay network with $L$ users and a single relay. The relay tries to decode a linear function of the transmitted signals. For such a network, letting all $L$ users transmit simultaneously, especially when $L$ is large, causes a significant degradation in the rate in which the relay is able to decode. In fact, the rate goes to zero very fast with $L$. Therefore, in each transmission phase only a fixed number of users should transmit, i.e., users should be scheduled. <br />In this work, we examine the problem of scheduling for CF and lay the foundations for identifying the optimal schedule which, to date, lacks a clear understanding. Specifically, we start with insights why when the number of users is large, good scheduling opportunities can be found. Then, we provide an asymptotically optimal, polynomial time scheduling algorithm and analyze it's performance. We conclude that scheduling under CF provides a gain in the system sum-rate, up to the optimal scaling law of $O(\log{\log{L}})$.;cs.IT

We propose a novel non-iterative reconstruction method for solving the aforementioned inverse problem from far-field measurements. The method is based on recovering the Fourier coefficients of the unknown source. A key ingredient of the method is to establish the relationship between the Fourier coefficients and the multi-frequency far-field data. Uniqueness and stability results are established for the proposed reconstruction method. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the method.;math.AP

1801.03266;Improved Time of Arrival measurement model for non-convex optimization;The quadratic system provided by the Time of Arrival technique can be solved analytically or by optimization algorithms. In practice, a combination of both methods is used. An important problem in quadratic optimization is the possible convergence to a local minimum, instead of the global minimum. This article presents an approach how this risk can be significantly reduced. The main idea of our approach is to transform the local minimum to a saddle point, by increasing the number of dimensions. In contrast to similar methods such as, dimension lifting does our problem remains non-convex.;math.OC
1801.03271;Existence and non-existence of maximizers for the Moser-Trudinger type inequalities under inhomogeneous constraints;In this paper, we study the existence and non-existence of maximizers for the Moser-Trudinger type inequalities in $\Bbb R^N$ of the form <br />\[ <br />D_{N,\alpha}(a,b):= <br />\sup_{u\in W^{1,N}(\Bbb R^N),\,\|\nabla u\|_{L^N(\Bbb R^N)}^a+\|u\|_{L^N(\Bbb R^N)}^b=1} <br />\int_{\Bbb R^N}\Phi_N\left(\alpha|u|^{N'}\right)dx. <br />\] Here $N\geq 2$, $N'=\frac{N}{N-1}$, $a,b&gt,0$, $\alpha \in (0,\alpha_N]$ and $\Phi_N(t):=e^t-\sum_{j=0}^{N-2}\frac{t^j}{j!}$ where $\alpha_N:= N \omega_{N-1}^{1/(N-1)}$ and $\omega_{N-1}$ denotes the surface area of the unit ball in $\Bbb R^N$. We show the existence of the threshold $\alpha_\ast = \alpha_\ast(a,b,N) \in [0,\alpha_N]$ such that $D_{N,\alpha}(a,b)$ is not attained if $\alpha \in (0,\alpha_\ast)$ and is attained if $ \alpha \in (\alpha_\ast , \alpha_N)$. We also provide the conditions on $(a,b)$ in order that the inequality $\alpha_\ast &lt, \alpha_N$ holds.;math.AP
1801.03280;Algebraic separatrices for non-dicritical foliations on projective spaces of dimension at least four;Non-dicritical codimension one foliations on projective spaces of dimension four or higher always have an invariant algebraic hypersurface. The proof relies on a strengthening of a result by Rossi on the algebraization/continuation of analytic subvarieties of projective spaces.;math.AG
1801.03284;Markovian tricks for non-Markovian trees: contour process, extinction and scaling limits;In this work, we study a family of non-Markovian trees modeling populations where individuals live and reproduce independently with possibly time-dependent birth-rate and lifetime distribution. To this end, we use the coding process introduced by Lambert. We show that, in our situation, this process is no longer a L{\'e}vy process but remains a Feller process and we give a complete characterization of its generator. This allows us to study the model through well-known Markov processes techniques. On one hand, introducing a scale function for such processes allows us to get necessary and sufficient conditions for extinction or non-extinction and to characterize the law of such trees conditioned on these events. On the other hand, using Lyapounov drift techniques , we get another set of, easily checkable, sufficient criteria for extinction or non-extinction and some tail estimates for the tree length. Finally, we also study scaling limits of such random trees and observe that the Bessel tree appears naturally.;math.PR
1801.03287;Convergence of Pascal-Like Triangles in Parry-Bertrand Numeration Systems;We pursue the investigation of generalizations of the Pascal triangle based on binomial coefficients of finite words. These coefficients count the number of times a finite word appears as a subsequence of another finite word. The finite words occurring in this paper belong to the language of a Parry numeration system satisfying the Bertrand property, i.e., we can add or remove trailing zeroes to valid representations. It is a folklore fact that the Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket is the limit set, for the Hausdorff distance, of a convergent sequence of normalized compact blocks extracted from the classical Pascal triangle modulo $2$. In a similar way, we describe and study the subset of $[0, 1] \times [0, 1]$ associated with the latter generalization of the Pascal triangle modulo a prime number.;math.CO
1801.03300;Shapley effects for sensitivity analysis with dependent inputs: bootstrap and kriging-based algorithms;In global sensitivity analysis, the well known Sobol' sensitivity indices aim to quantify how the variance in the output of a mathematical model can be apportioned to the different variances of its input random variables. These indices are based on the functional variance decomposition and their interpretation become difficult in the presence of statistical dependence between the inputs. However, as there is dependence in many application studies, that enhances the development of interpretable sensitivity indices. Recently, the Shapley values developed in the field of cooperative games theory have been connected to global sensitivity analysis and present good properties in the presence of dependencies. Nevertheless, the available estimation methods don't always provide confidence intervals and require a large number of model evaluation. In this paper, we implement a bootstrap sampling in the existing algorithms to estimate confidence intervals of the indice estimations. We also proposed to consider a metamodel in substitution of a costly numerical model. The estimation error from the Monte-Carlo sampling is combined with the metamodel error in order to have confidence intervals on the Shapley effects. Besides, we compare for different examples with dependent random variables the results of the Shapley effects with existing extensions of the Sobol' indices.;math.ST
1801.03302;An improvement in the linear stable ranges for ordered configuration spaces;Recently, Church-Miller-Nagpal-Reinhold [<a href="/abs/1706.03845">arXiv:1706.03845</a>] obtained linear stable ranges for the integral cohomology of ordered configuration spaces, in the sense of representation stability. We note that the constants in these linear stable ranges can be further improved for an orientable manifold of dimension at least 3. The idea is to simply exploit the sparsity of Totaro's spectral sequence.;math.RT
1801.03308;On minimal actions of countable groups;Our purpose here is to review some recent developments in the theory of dynamical systems whose common theme is a link between minimal dynamical systems, certain Ramsey type combinatorial properties, and the Lovasz local lemma (LLL). For a general countable group G the two classes of minimal systems we will deal with are (I) the minimal subsystems of the {\em subgroup system} (Sub(G), G), called URS's (uniformly recurrent subgroups), and (II) minimal {\em subshifts}, i.e. subsystems of the binary Bernoulli G-shift ({0, 1}^G, {\sig_g}_{g \in G}).;math.DS
1801.03313;The Reidemeister graph is a complete knot invariant;We describe two locally finite graphs naturally associated to each knot type K, called Reidemeister graphs. We determine several local and global properties of these graphs and prove that in one case the graph-isomorphism type is a complete knot invariant up to mirroring. Lastly, we introduce another object, relating the Reidemeister and Gordian graphs, and determine some of its properties.;math.GT
1801.03319;No eigenvalues outside the limiting support of the spectral distribution of general sample covariance matrices;This paper is to investigate the spectral properties of sample covariance matrices under a more general population. We consider a class of matrices of the form $\mathbf S_n=\frac1n\mathbf B_n\mathbf X_n\mathbf X_n^*\mathbf B_n^*$, where $\mathbf B_n$ is a $p\times m$ non-random matrix and $\mathbf X_n$ is an $m\times n$ matrix consisting of i.i.d standard complex entries. $p/n\to c\in (0,\infty)$ as $n\to \infty$ while $m$ can be arbitrary. We proved that under some mild assumptions, with probability 1, there will be no eigenvalues in any closed interval contained in an open interval outside the supports of the limiting distribution $F_{c_n,H_n}$, for all sufficiently large $n$. An extension of Bai-Yin law is also obtained.;math.PR
1801.03320;A Canonical Form for a Symplectic Involution;We present a canonical form for a symplectic involution $S\in Sp(2g,\mathbb{Z})$, $S^2=1$, the construction is algorithmic. Application is made in the Riemann surface setting.;math.RT
1801.03324;Homology groups of cubical sets;The paper is devoted to homology groups of cubical sets with coefficients in contravariant systems of Abelian groups. The study is based on the proof of the assertion that the homology groups of the category of cubes with coefficients in the diagram of Abelian groups are isomorphic to the homology groups of normalized complex of the cubical Abelian group corresponding to this diagram. The main result shows that the homology groups of a cubical set with coefficients in a contravariant system of Abelian groups are isomorphic to the values of left derived functors of the colimit functor on this contravariant system. This is used to obtain the isomorphism criterion for homology groups of cubical sets with coefficients in contravariant systems, and also to construct spectral sequences for the covering of a cubical set and for a morphism between cubical sets.;math.AT
1801.03332;Gaussian fluctuations for linear spectral statistics of Wigner beta ensembles;As an important topic in Mathematical Physics and statistics, random matrices theory has found uses in many aspects of modern physics and multivariate analysis. This paper is to investigate the Gaussian fluctuations for linear spectral statistics (LSS) of Wigner beta ensembles. We first establish a central limit theorem (CLT) for LSS of Wigner quaternion matrices, then give a general CLT for Wigner $\beta$ ensembles.;math.PR
1801.03336;BSDE formulation of combined regular and singular stochastic control problems;In this paper we study a class of combined regular and singular stochastic control problems that can be expressed as constrained BSDEs. In the Markovian case, this reduces to a characterization through a PDE with gradient constraint. But the BSDE formulation makes it possible to move beyond Markovian models and consider path-dependent problems. We also provide an approximation of the original control problem with standard BSDEs that yield a characterization of approximately optimal values and controls.;math.OC
1801.03337;Distribution of the absolute indicator of random Boolean functions;The absolute indicator is one of the measures used to determine the resistance offered by a Boolean function when used in the design of a symmetric cryptosystem. It was proposed along with the sum of square indicator to evaluate the quality of the diffusion property of block ciphers and hash functions. While the behaviour of the sum of square of random Boolean functions was already known, what remained was the study of the comportment of the absolute indicator of random Boolean functions. As an application, we show that the absolute indicator can distinguish a nonrandom binary sequence from a random one.;cs.IT
1801.03340;The critical 1-arm exponent for the ferromagnetic Ising model on the Bethe lattice;We consider the ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor Ising model on regular trees (Bethe lattice), which is well-known to undergo a phase transition in the absence of an external magnetic field. The behavior of the model at critical temperature can be described in terms of various critical exponents, one of them is the critical 1-arm exponent $\rho$, which characterizes the rate of decay of the (root) magnetization. The crucial quantity we analyze in this work is the thermal expectation of the root spin on a finite subtree, where the expected value is taken with respect to a probability measure related to the corresponding finite-volume Hamiltonian with a fixed boundary condition. The spontaneous magnetization, which is the limit of this thermal expectation in the distance between the root and the boundary (i.e. in the height of the subtree), is known to vanish at criticality. We are interested in a quantitative analysis of the rate of this convergence in terms of the critical 1-arm exponent $\rho$. Therefore, we rigorously prove that $\langle\sigma_0\rangle^+_n$, the thermal expectation of the root spin at the critical temperature and in the presence of the positive boundary condition, decays as $\langle\sigma_0\rangle^+_n\approx n^{-1/2}$ (in a rather sharp sense), where $n$ is the height of the tree. This establishes the 1-arm critical exponent for the Ising model on regular trees ($\rho=1/2$).;math.PR
1801.03341;Harder-Narasimhan filtrations for Breuil-Kisin-Fargues modules;We define and study Harder-Narasimhan filtrations on Breuil-Kisin-Fargues modules and related objects relevant to p-adic Hodge theory.;math.AG
1801.03343;Some remarks on the optimality of the Bruno-R{&#xfc,}ssmann condition;We prove that the Bruno-R{\"u}ssmann condition is optimal for the analytic preservation of a quasi-periodic invariant curve for an analytic twist map. The proof is based on Yoccoz's corresponding result for analytic circle diffeomorphisms and the uniqueness of invariant curves with a given irrational rotation number. We also prove a similar result for analytic Tonelli Hamiltonian flow with n = 2 degrees of freedom, for n $\ge$ 3 we only obtain a weaker result which recovers and slightly improves a theorem of Bessi.;math.DS
1801.03344;BV functions in Hilbert spaces;We study $BV$ functions in a Hilbert space $X$ endowed with a probability measure $\nu$, assuming that $\nu$ is Fomin differentiable along suitable directions. We establish basic characterizations, and we apply the general theory to relevant examples, including invariant measures of some stochastic PDEs.;math.FA
1801.03345;Optimal functional supervised classification with separation condition;We consider the binary supervised classification problem with the Gaussian functional model introduced in [7]. Taking advantage of the Gaussian structure, we design a natural plug-in classifier and derive a family of upper bounds on its worst-case excess risk over Sobolev spaces. These bounds are parametrized by a separation distance quantifying the difficulty of the problem, and are proved to be optimal (up to logarithmic factors) through matching minimax lower bounds. Using the recent works of [9] and [14] we also derive a logarithmic lower bound showing that the popular k-nearest neighbors classifier is far from optimality in this specific functional setting.;math.ST
1801.03346;Statistical Blockage Modeling and Robustness of Beamforming in Millimeter Wave Systems;There has been a growing interest in the commercialization of millimeter wave (mmW) technology as a part of the Fifth-Generation New Radio (5G-NR) wireless standardization efforts. In this direction, many sets of independent measurement campaigns show that wireless propagation at mmW carrier frequencies is only marginally worse than propagation at sub-6 GHz carrier frequencies for small-cell coverage --- one of the most important use-cases for 5G-NR. On the other hand, the biggest determinants of viability of mmW systems in practice are penetration and blockage of mmW signals through different materials in the scattering environment. With this background, the focus of this paper is on understanding the impact of blockage of mmW signals and reduced spatial coverage due to penetration through the human hand, body, vehicles, etc. Leveraging measurements with a 28 GHz mmW experimental prototype and electromagnetic simulation studies, we first propose statistical blockage models to capture the impact of the hand, human body and vehicles. We then study the time-scales at which mmW signals are disrupted by blockage (hand and human body). Our results show that these events can be attributed to physical movements and the time-scales corresponding to blockage are hence on the order of a few 100 ms or more. Building on this fundamental understanding, we finally consider the broader question of robustness of mmW beamforming to handle blockage. Network densification, subarray switching in a user equipment (UE) designed with multiple subarrays, fall back mechanisms such as codebook enhancements and switching to legacy carriers in non-standalone deployments, etc. can address blockage before it leads to a deleterious impact on the mmW link margin.;cs.IT
1801.03348;Side Disks of a Spherical Great Polygon;Take a circle and mark $n\in\mathbb{N}$ points on it designated as vertices. For any arc segment between two consecutive vertices which does not pass through any other vertex, there is a disk centered at its midpoint and has its end points on the boundary. We analyze intersection behaviour of these disks and show that the number of disjoint pairs among them is between $\frac{(n-2)(n-3)}{2}$ and $\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$ and their intersection graph is a subgraph of a triangulation of a convex $n$-gon.;math.CO
1801.03349;Mean-field backward stochastic differential equations and applications;In this paper we study the mean-field backward stochastic differential equations (mean-field bsde) of the form dY(t) =-f(t,Y(t),Z(t),K(t, . ),E[\varphi(Y(t),Z(t),K(t,.))])dt+Z(t)dB(t) +\int_{R_{0}}K(t,\zeta)\tilde{N}(dt,d\zeta), where B is a Brownian motion, \tilde{N} is the compensated Poisson random measure. <br />Under some mild conditions, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution triplet (Y,Z,K). It is commonly believed that there is no comparison theorem for general mean-field bsde. However, we prove a comparison theorem for a subclass of these equations. When the mean-field bsde is linear, we give an explicit formula for the first component Y(t) of the solution triplet. Our results are applied to solve a mean-field recursive utility optimization problem in finance.;math.OC
1801.03351;A triple comparison between anticipating stochastic integrals in financial modeling;We consider a simplified version of the problem of insider trading in a financial market. We approach it by means of anticipating stochastic calculus and compare the use of the Hitsuda-Skorokhod, the Ayed-Kuo, and the Russo-Vallois forward integrals within this context. Our results give some indication that, while the forward integral yields results with a suitable financial meaning, the Hitsuda-Skorokhod and the Ayed-Kuo integrals do not provide an appropriate formulation of this problem. Further results regarding the use of the Ayed-Kuo integral in this context are also provided, including the proof of the fact that the expectation of a Russo-Vallois solution is strictly greater than that of an Ayed-Kuo solution. Finally, we conjecture the explicit solution of an Ayed-Kuo stochastic differential equation that possesses discontinuous sample paths with finite probability.;math.PR
1801.03357;Singular equivalences of functor categories via Auslander-Buchweitz approximations;The aim of this paper is to construct singular equivalences between functor categories. As a special case, we show that there exists a singular equivalence arising from a cotilting module $T$, namely, the singularity category of $(^\perp T)/[T]$ and that of $(\mod A)/[T]$ are triangle equivalent. In particular, the canonical module $\omega$ over a commutative Noetherian ring induces a singular equivalence between $(\mathsf{CM}R)/[\omega]$ and $(\mod R)/[\omega]$, which generalizes Matsui-Takahashi's theorem. Our result is based on a sufficient condition for an additive category $\mathcal{A}$ and its subcategory $\mathcal{X}$ so that the canonical inclusion $\mathcal{X}\hookrightarrow\mathcal{A}$ induces a singular equivalence $\mathsf{D_{sg}}(\mathcal{A})\simeq \mathsf{D_{sg}}(\mathcal{X})$, which is a functor category version of Xiao-Wu Chen's theorem.;math.CT
1801.03359;Symbolic dynamics for one dimensional maps with nonuniform expansion;Given a piecewise $C^{1+\beta}$ map of the interval, possibly with critical points and discontinuities, we construct a symbolic model for invariant probability measures with nonuniform expansion that do not approach the critical points and discontinuities exponentially fast almost surely. More specifically, we code the lift of these measures in the natural extension of the map.;math.DS
1801.03360;On an Electro-Magneto-Elasto-Dynamic Transmission Problem;We consider a coupled system describing the interaction between acoustic and elastic regions, where the coupling occurs not via material properties but through an interaction on an interface separating the two regimes. Evolutionary well-posedness in the sense of Hadamard well-posedness supplemented by causal dependence is shown for a natural choice of generalized interface conditions. The results are obtained in a real Hilbert space setting incurring no regularity constraints on the boundary and almost none on the interface of the underlying regions.;math-ph
1801.03361;Regularity for evolution equations with non-autonomous perturbations in Banach spaces;We provide regularity of solutions to a large class of evolution equations on Banach spaces where the generator is composed of a static principal part plus a non-autonomous perturbation. Regularity is examined with respect to the graph norm of the iterations of the principal part. The results are applied to the Schr\"odinger equation and conditions on a time-dependent scalar potential for regularity of the solution in higher Sobolev spaces are derived.;math-ph
1801.03362;On an Elasto-Acoustic Transmission Problem in Anisotropic, Inhomogeneous Media;We consider a coupled system describing the interaction between acoustic and elastic regions, where the coupling occurs not via material properties but through an interaction on an interface separating the two regimes.

1801.03364;Mean-Field Delayed BSDEs with Jumps;We establish sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of mean-field backward stochastic differential equations with time delayed generator in the sense that at t, the generator may depend on previous values up to a delay constant {\delta} not on the hole past as in Delong and Imkeller [10], [13]. For sufficiently small delay constant {\delta} and for any finite time horizon, we get a unique solution.;math.OC

1801.03369;Johnson pseudo-Connes amenability of dual Banach algebras;We introduce the notion of Johnson pseudo-Connes amenability for dual Banach algebras. We study the relation between this new notion with the various notions of Connes amenability like Connes amenability, approximate Connes amenability and pseudo Connes amenability. We also investigate some hereditary properties of this new notion. We prove that for a locally compact group $G$, $M(G)$ is Johnson pseudo-Connes amenable if and only if $G$ is amenable. Also we show that for every non-empty set $I$, $\mathbb{M}_I(\mathbb{C})$ under this new notion is forced to have a finite index. Finally, we provide some examples of certain dual Banach algebras and we study their Johnson pseudo-Connes amenability.;math.FA
1801.03372;Localised modes due to defects in high contrast periodic media via two-scale homogenization;The spectral problem for an infinite periodic medium perturbed by a compact defect is considered. For a high contrast small $\ve$-size periodicity and a finite size defect we consider the critical $\ve^2$-scaling for the contrast. We employ (high contrast) two-scale homogenization for deriving asymptotically explicit limit equations for the localised modes (exponentially decaying eigenfunctions) and associated eigenvalues. Those are expressed in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a perturbed version of a two-scale limit operator introduced by V.V. Zhikov with an emergent explicit nonlinear dependence on the spectral parameter for the spectral problem at the macroscale. Using the method of asymptotic expansions supplemented by a high contrast boundary layer analysis we establish the existence of the actual eigenvalues near the eigenvalues of the limit operator, with %tight "$ \ve$ square root" error bounds. An example for circular or spherical defects in a periodic medium with isotropic homogenized properties is given and displays explicit limit eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Further results on improved error bounds for the eigenfunctions are discussed, by combining our results with those of M. Cherdantsev ({\it Mathematika. 2009,55:29--57}) based on the technique of strong two-scale resolvent convergence and associated two-scale compactness properties.;math.SP
1801.03374;$WAP$-biprojectivity of the enveloping dual Banach algebras;In this paper, we introduce a new notion of biprojectivity, called $WAP$-biprojectivity for $F(\mathcal{A})$, the enveloping dual Banach algebra associated to a Banach algebra $\mathcal{A}$. We find some relations between Connes biprojectivity, Connes amenability and this new notion. We show that, for a given dual Banach algebra $\mathcal{A}$, if $F(\mathcal{A})$ is Connes amenable, then $\mathcal{A}$ is Connes amenable. <br />For an infinite commutative compact group $G$, we show that the convolution Banach algebra $F(L^2(G))$ is not $WAP$-biprojective. Finally, we provide some examples of the enveloping dual Banach algebras and we study their $WAP$-biprojectivity and Connes amenability.;math.FA
1801.03377;A minimal PI cascade with $2^{\mathfrak{c}}$ minimal ideals;We first improve an old result of McMahon and show that a metric minimal flow whose enveloping semigroup contains less than $2^{\mathfrak{c}}$ (where ${\mathfrak{c}} ={2^{\aleph_0}}$) minimal left ideals is PI. Then we show the existence of various minimal PI flows with many minimal left ideals, as follows. For the acting group $G=SL_2(\mathbb{R})^\mathbb{N}$, we construct a metric minimal PI $G$-flow with $\mathfrak{c}$ minimal left ideals. We then use this example and results established in \cite{GW-79} to construct a metric minimal PI cascade $(X,T)$ with $\mathfrak{c}$ minimal left ideals. We go on and construct an example of a minimal PI-flow $(Y, \mathcal{G})$ on a compact manifold $Y$ and a suitable path-wise connected group $\mathcal{G}$ of homeomorphism of $Y$, such that the flow $(Y, \mathcal{G})$ is PI and has $2^{\mathfrak{c}}$ minimal left ideals. Finally, we use this latter example and a theorem of Dirb\'{a}k to construct a cascade $(X, T)$ which is PI (of order 3) and has $2^\mathfrak{c}$ minimal left ideals. Thus this final result shows that, even for cascades, the converse of the implication "less than $2^\mathfrak{c}$ minimal left ideals implies PI", fails.;math.DS
1801.03378;On Connes amenability of upper triangular matrix algebras;In this paper, we study the notion of Connes amenability for a class of $I\times{I}$-upper triangular matrix algebra $UP(I,\mathcal{A})$, where $\mathcal{A}$ is a dual Banach algebra with a non-zero $wk^\ast$-continuous character and $I$ is a totally ordered set. For this purpose, we characterize the $\phi$-Connes amenability of a dual Banach algebra $\mathcal{A}$ through the existence of a specified net in $\mathcal{A}\hat{\otimes}\mathcal{A}$, where $\phi$ is a non-zero $wk^\ast$-continuous character. Using this, we show that $UP(I,\mathcal{A})$ is Connes amenable if and only if $I$ is singleton and $\mathcal{A}$ is Connes amenable. In addition, some examples of $\phi$-Connes amenable dual Banach algebras, which is not Connes amenable are given.;math.FA
1801.03379;On Maximally Recoverable Codes for Product Topologies;Given a topology of local parity-check constraints, a maximally recoverable code (MRC) can correct all erasure patterns that are information-theoretically correctable. In a grid-like topology, there are $a$ local constraints in every column forming a column code, $b$ local constraints in every row forming a row code, and $h$ global constraints in an $(m \times n)$ grid of codeword. Recently, Gopalan et al. initiated the study of MRCs under grid-like topology, and derived a necessary and sufficient condition, termed as the regularity condition, for an erasure pattern to be recoverable when $a=1, h=0$. <br />In this paper, we consider MRCs for product topology ($h=0$). First, we construct a certain bipartite graph based on the erasure pattern satisfying the regularity condition for product topology (any $a, b$, $h=0$) and show that there exists a complete matching in this graph. We then present an alternate direct proof of the sufficient condition when $a=1, h=0$. We later extend our technique to study the topology for $a=2, h=0$, and characterize a subset of recoverable erasure patterns in that case. For both $a=1, 2$, our method of proof is uniform, i.e., by constructing tensor product $G_{\text{col}} \otimes G_{\text{row}}$ of generator matrices of column and row codes such that certain square sub-matrices retain full rank. The full-rank condition is proved by resorting to the matching identified earlier and also another set of matchings in erasure sub-patterns.;cs.IT
1801.03381;Recovery of Binary Sparse Signals with Biased Measurement Matrices;This work treats the recovery of sparse, binary signals through box-constrained basis pursuit using biased measurement matrices. Using a probabilistic model, we provide conditions under which the recovery of both sparse and saturated binary signals is very likely. In fact, we also show that under the same condition, the solution of the boxed-constrained basis pursuit program can be found using boxed-constrained least-squares.;math.NA
1801.03383;Games for eigenvalues of the Hessian and concave/convex envelopes;We study the PDE $\lambda_j(D^2 u) = 0$, in $\Omega$, with $u=g$, on $\partial \Omega$. Here $\lambda_1(D^2 u) \leq ... \leq \lambda_N (D^2 u)$ are the ordered eigenvalues of the Hessian $D^2 u$. First, we show a geometric interpretation of the viscosity solutions to the problem in terms of convex/concave envelopes over affine spaces of dimension $j$. In one of our main results, we give necessary and sufficient conditions on the domain so that the problem has a continuous solution for every continuous datum $g$. Next, we introduce a two-player zero-sum game whose values approximate solutions to this PDE problem. In addition, we show an asymptotic mean value characterization for the solution the the PDE.;math.AP
1801.03386;Asymptotics of the density of parabolic Anderson random fields;We investigate the sharp density $\rho(t,x, y)$ of the solution $u(t,x)$ to stochastic partial differential equation $\frac{\partial }{\partial t} u(t,x)=\frac12 \Delta u(t,x)+u\diamond \dot W(t,x)$, where $\dot W$ is a general Gaussian noise and $\diamond$ denotes the Wick product. We mainly concern with the asymptotic behavior of $\rho(t,x, y)$ when $y\rightarrow \infty$ or when $t\to0+$. Both upper and lower bounds are obtained and these two bounds match each other modulo some multiplicative constants. If the initial datum is positive, then $\rho(t,x,y)$ is supported on the positive half line $y\in [0, \infty)$ and in this case we show that $\rho(t,x, 0+)=0$ and obtain an upper bound for $\rho(t,x, y)$ when $y\rightarrow 0+$.;math.PR

1801.03402;Modelling wave propagation without sampling restrictions using the multiplicative calculus I: Theoretical considerations;The multiplicative (or geometric) calculus is a non-Newtonian calculus derived from an arithmetic in which the operations of addition/subtraction/multiplication are replaced by multiplication/division/exponentiation. A major difference between the multiplicative calculus and the classical additive calculus, and one that has important consequences in the simulation of wave propagation problems, is that in geometric calculus the role of polynomials is played by exponentials of a polynomial argument. For example, whereas a polynomial of degree one has constant (classical) derivative, it is the exponential function that has constant derivative in the multiplicative calculus. As we will show, this implies that even low-order finite quotient approximations|the analogues of finite differences in the multiplicative calculus|produce exact multiplicative derivatives of exponential functions. We exploit this fact to show that some partial differential equations (PDE) can be solved far more efficiently using techniques based on the multiplicative calculus. For wave propagation models in particular, we will show that it is possible to circumvent the minimum-points-per-wavelength sampling constraints of classical methods. In this first part we develop the theoretical framework for studying multiplicative partial differential equations and their connections with classical models.;math.NA

1801.03410;Noncommutative Euclidean spaces;We give a definition of noncommutative finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces $\mathbb R^n$. We then remind our definition of noncommutative products of Euclidean spaces $\mathbb R^{N_1}$ and $\mathbb R^{N_2}$ which produces noncommutative Euclidean spaces $\mathbb R^{N_1+N_2}$. We solve completely the conditions defining the noncommutative products of the Euclidean spaces $\mathbb R^{N_1}$ and $\mathbb R^{N_2}$ and prove that the corresponding noncommutative unit spheres $S^{N_1+N_2-1}$ are noncommutative spherical manifolds. We then apply these concepts to define "noncommutative" quaternionic planes and noncommutative quaternionic tori on which acts the classical quaternionic torus $T^2_{\mathbb H}=U_1(\mathbb H)\times U_1(\mathbb H)$;math.QA
1801.03413;Characterizing subclasses of cover-incomparability graphs by forbidden subposets;In this paper we continue investigations of cover-incomparability graphs of finite partially ordered sets (see \cite{Bres,Bres2,Bres3,Bres4} and \cite{Max,MaxDH}). We consider in some detail the distinction between cover-preserving subsets and isometric subsets of a partially ordered set. This is critical to understanding why forbidden subposet characterizations of certain classes of cover-incomparability graphs in \cite{Bres} and \cite{Bres3} are not valid as presented. Here we provide examples, investigate the root of the difficulties, and formulate and prove valid revisions of these characterizations.;math.CO
1801.03414;On neoclassical Schottky groups;The goal of this paper is to describe a theoretical construction of an infinite collection of non-classical Schottky groups. We first show that there are infinitely many non-classical noded Schottky groups on the boundary of Schottky space, and we show that infinitely many of these are "sufficiently complicated". We then show that every Schottky group in an appropriately defined relative conical neighborhood of any sufficiently complicated noded Schottky group is necessarily non-classical. Finally, we construct two examples, the first is a noded Riemann surface of genus $3$ that cannot be uniformized by any neoclassical Schottky group (i.e., classical noded Schottky group), the second is an explicit example of a sufficiently complicated noded Schottky group in genus $3$.;math.GT
1801.03422;Age of Information: Whittle Index for Scheduling Stochastic Arrivals;Age of information is a new concept that characterizes the freshness of information at end devices. This paper studies the age of information from a scheduling perspective. We consider a wireless broadcast network where a base-station updates many users on stochastic information arrivals. Suppose that only one user can be updated for each time. In this context, we aim at developing a transmission scheduling algorithm for minimizing the long-run average age. To develop a low-complexity transmission scheduling algorithm, we apply the Whittle's framework for restless bandits. We successfully derive the Whittle index in a closed form and establish the indexability. Based on the Whittle index, we propose a scheduling algorithm, while experimentally showing that it closely approximates an age-optimal scheduling algorithm.;math.OC
1801.03427;Nonautonomous Conley Index Theory: The Connecting Homomorphism;Attractor-repeller decompositions of isolated invariant sets give rise to so-called connecting homomorphisms. These homomorphisms reveal information on the existence and structure of connecting trajectories of the underlying dynamical system. <br />To give a meaningful generalization of this general principle to nonautonomous problems, the nonautonomous homology Conley index is expressed as a direct limit. Moreover, it is shown that a nontrivial connecting homomorphism implies, on the dynamical systems level, a sort of uniform connectedness of the attractor-repeller decomposition.;math.DS
1801.03432;On the determinants and permanents of matrices with restricted entries over prime fields;Let $A$ be a set in a prime field $\mathbb{F}_p$. In this paper, we prove that $d\times d$ matrices with entries in $A$ determine almost $|A|^{3+\frac{1}{45}}$ distinct determinants and almost $|A|^{2-\frac{1}{6}}$ distinct permanents when $|A|$ is small enough.;math.CO
1801.03433;Integrability of $\mathcal W({\mathfrak{sl}_d})$-symmetric Toda conformal field theories I : Quantum geometry;In this article which is the first of a series of three, we consider $\mathcal W({\mathfrak{sl}_d})$-symmetric conformal field theory in topological regimes for a generic value of the background charge, where $\mathcal W({\mathfrak{sl}_d})$ is the W-algebra associated to the affine Lie algebra $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_d}$, whose vertex operator algebra is included to that of the affine Lie algebra $\widehat{\mathfrak g}_1$ at level 1. In such regimes, the theory admits a free field representation. We show that the generalized Ward identities assumed to be satisfied by chiral conformal blocks with current insertions can be solved perturbatively in topological regimes. This resolution uses a generalization of the topological recursion to non-commutative, or quantum, spectral curves. In turn, special geometry arguments yields a conjecture for the perturbative reconstruction of a particular chiral block.;math-ph
1801.03444;The Dirichlet problem for singular elliptic equations with general nonlinearities;In this paper, under very general assumptions, we prove existence and regularity of distributional solutions to homogeneous Dirichlet problems of the form $$\begin{cases} \displaystyle - \Delta_{1} u = h(u)f &amp, \text{in}\, \Omega,\newline u\geq 0&amp, \text{in}\ \Omega, \newline u=0 &amp, \text{on}\ \partial \Omega, \end{cases} $$ where, $\Delta_{1} $ is the $1$-laplace operator, $\Omega$ is a bounded open subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$ with Lipschitz boundary, $h(s)$ is a continuous function which may become singular at $s=0^{+}$, and $f$ is a nonnegative datum in $L^{N,\infty}(\Omega)$ with suitable small norm. Uniqueness of solutions is also shown provided $h$ is decreasing and $f&gt,0$. As a by-product of our method a general theory for the same problem involving the $p$-laplacian as principal part, which is missed in the literature, is established. The main assumptions we use are also further discussed in order to show their optimality.;math.AP
1801.03447;Elliptic 1-Laplacian Equations with Dynamical Boundary Conditions;This paper is concerned with an evolution problem having an elliptic equation involving the 1-Laplacian operator and a dynamical boundary condition. We apply nonlinear semigroup theory to obtain existence and uniqueness results as well as a comparison principle. Our main theorem shows that the solution we found is actually a strong solution. We also compare solutions with different data.;math.AP
1801.03450;A new generalization of Browder degree;A new generalization of the Browder's degree for the mappings of the type $(S)_+$ is presented. The main idea is rooted in the observation that the Browder's degree remains unchanged for the mappings of the form $A: Y\to X^*$, where $Y$ is a reflexive uniformly convex Banach space continuously embedded in the Banach space $X$. The advantage of the suggested degree lies in the simplicity it provides for the calculations of the degree associated with nonlinear operators. An application from the theory of phase transition in liquid crystals is presented for which the suggested degree has been successfully applied.;math.AP
1801.03457;A class of $L_1$-to-$L_1$ and $L_\infty$-to-$L_\infty$ interval observers for (delayed) Markov jump linear systems;We exploit recent results on the stability and performance analysis of positive Markov jump linear systems (MJLS) for the design of interval observers for MJLS with and without delays. While the conditions for the $L_1$ performance are necessary and sufficient, those for the $L_\infty$ performance are only sufficient. All the conditions are stated as linear programs that can be solved very efficiently. Two examples are given for illustration.;math.OC
1801.03464;Stability analysis and state-feedback control of LPV systems with piecewise constant parameters subject to spontaneous Poissonian jumps;LPV systems with piecewise constant parameters subject to spontaneous Poissonian jumps are a class of systems that does not seem to have been thoroughly considered in the literature. We partially fill this gap here by providing sufficient stability and performance analysis conditions stated in terms of infinite-dimensional LMI problems that can be solved using sum of squares programming. A particularity of the obtained conditions lies in the presence of an integral term leading to some technical difficulties when attempting to obtain convex conditions for the design of a gain-scheduled state-feedback controller. This difficulty is circumvented by relying on a recent result for time-delay systems analysis and an equivalent integral-free LMI condition is obtained. The approach is illustrated through several examples.;math.OC
1801.03465;Reducible characteristic cycles of Harish-Chandra modules for $\mathrm{U}(p,q)$ and the Kashiwara-Saito singularity;We give examples of reducible characteristic cycles for irreducible Harish-Chandra modules for $\mathrm{U}(p,q)$ by analyzing a four-dimensional singular subvariety of $\mathbb{C}^8$. We relate this singularity to the Kashiwara-Saito singularity arising for Schubert varieties for ${\mathrm{GL}}(8,\mathbb{C})$ with reducible characteristic cycles, as well as recent related examples of Williamson. In particular, this gives another explanation of the simple highest weight modules for ${\mathfrak{g}}{\mathfrak{l}}(12,\mathbb{C})$ with reducible associated varieties that Williamson discovered.;math.RT
1801.03467;Infinity-operads and Day convolution in Goodwillie calculus;We prove two theorems about Goodwillie calculus and use those theorems to describe new models for Goodwillie derivatives of functors between pointed compactly-generated infinity-categories. The first theorem say that the construction of higher derivatives for spectrum-valued functors is a Day convolution of copies of the first derivative construction. The second theorem says that the derivatives of any functor can be realized as natural transformation objects for derivatives of spectrum-valued functors. Together these results allow us to construct an infinity-operad that models the derivatives of the identity functor on any pointed compactly-generated infinity-category. <br />Our main example is the infinity-category of algebras over a stable infinity-operad, in which case we show that the derivatives of the identity essentially recover the same infinity-operad, making precise a well-known slogan in Goodwillie calculus. <br />We also describe a bimodule structure on the derivatives of an arbitrary functor, over the infinity-operads given by the derivatives of the identity on the source and target, and we conjecture a chain rule that generalizes previous work of Arone and the author in the case of functors of pointed spaces and spectra.;math.AT
1801.03472;Orbifolds from a metric viewpoint;We characterize Riemannian orbifolds and their coverings in terms of metric geometry. In particular, we show that the metric double of a Riemannian orbifold along the closure of its codimension one stratum is a Riemannian orbifold and that the natural projection is an orbifold covering.;math.DG
1801.03473;Strong existence and uniqueness for stable stochastic differential equations with distributional drift;We consider the stochastic differential equation $$ dX_t = b(X_t) dt + dL_t,$$ where the drift $b$ is a generalized function and $L$ is a symmetric one dimensional $\alpha$-stable L\'evy processes, $\alpha \in (1, 2)$. We define the notion of solution to this equation and establish strong existence and uniqueness whenever $b$ belongs to the Besov--H\"{o}lder space $\mathcal{C}^\beta$ for $\beta &gt,1/2-\alpha/2$.;math.PR
1801.03475;Supercritical degenerate parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel system -- existence criterion given by the best constant in Sobolev&#x27,s inequality;This article presents a relationship between the sharp constant of the Sobolev inequality and the initial criterion to the global existence of degenerate parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel system with the diffusion exponent $\frac{2n}{2+n}&lt,m&lt,2-\frac{2}{n}$. The global weak solution obtained in this article does not need any smallness assumption on the initial data. Furthermore, a uniform in time $L^{\infty}$ estimate of the weak solutions is obtained via the Moser iteration, where the constant in $L^p$ estimate for the gradient of the chemical concentration has been exactly formulated in order to complete the iteration process.;math.AP
1801.03480;Smooth Version of Johnson&#x27,s Problem Concerning Derivations of Group Algebras;A description of the algebra of outer derivations of a group algebra of a finitely presented discrete group is given in terms of the Cayley complex of the groupoid of the adjoint action of the group. This task is a smooth version of Johnson's problem concerning the derivations of a group algebra. It is shown that the algebra of outer derivations is isomorphic to the group of the one-dimensional cohomology with compact supports of the Cayley complex over the field of complex numbers.;math.AT
1801.03481;Latent Factor Analysis of Gaussian Distributions under Graphical Constraints;In this paper, we explore the algebraic structures of solution spaces for Gaussian latent factor analysis when the population covariance matrix $\Sigma_x$ has an additional latent graphical constraint, namely, a latent star topology. In particular, we give sufficient and necessary conditions under which the solutions to constrained minimum trace factor analysis (CMTFA) is still star. We further show that the solution to CMTFA under the star constraint can only have two cases, i.e. the number of latent variable can be only one (star) or $n-1$ where $n$ is the dimension of the observable vector, and characterize the solution for both the cases.;cs.IT
1801.03482;Cohomological Hall algebra of Higgs sheaves on a curve;We define the cohomological Hall algebra ${AHA}_{Higgs(X)}$ of the ($2$-dimensional) Calabi-Yau category of Higgs sheaves on a smooth projective curve $X$, as well as its nilpotent and semistable variants, in the context of an arbitrary oriented Borel-Moore homology theory. In the case of usual Borel-Moore homology, ${AHA}_{Higgs(X)}$ is a module over the (universal) cohomology ring $\mathbb{H}$ of the stacks of coherent sheaves on $X$ . We show that it is a torsion-free $\mathbb{H}$-module, and we provide an explicit collection of generators (the collection of fundamental classes $[Coh_{r,d}]$ of the zero-sections of the map $Higgs_{r,d} \to Coh_{r,d}$, for $r \geq 0, d \in Z$).;math.AG
1801.03491;Note on the absence of remainders in the Wiener-Ikehara theorem;We show that it is impossible to get a better remainder than the classical one in the Wiener-Ikehara theorem even if one assumes analytic continuation of the Mellin transform after subtraction of the pole to a half-plane. We also prove a similar result for the Ingham-Karamata theorem.;math.CA
1801.03494;Secure Retrospective Interference Alignment;In this paper, the $K$-user interference channel with secrecy constraints is considered with delayed channel state information at transmitters (CSIT). We propose a novel secure retrospective interference alignment scheme in which the transmitters carefully mix information symbols with artificial noises to ensure confidentiality. Achieving positive secure degrees of freedom (SDoF) is challenging due to the delayed nature of CSIT, and the distributed nature of the transmitters. Our scheme works over two phases: phase one in which each transmitter sends information symbols mixed with artificial noises, and repeats such transmission over multiple rounds. In the next phase, each transmitter uses delayed CSIT of the previous phase and sends a function of the net interference and artificial noises (generated in previous phase), which is simultaneously useful for all receivers. These phases are designed to ensure the decodability of the desired messages while satisfying the secrecy constraints. We present our achievable scheme for three models, namely: 1) $K$-user interference channel with confidential messages (IC-CM), and we show that $\frac{1}{2} (\sqrt{K} -6) $ SDoF is achievable, 2) $K$-user interference channel with an external eavesdropper (IC-EE), and 3) $K$-user IC with confidential messages and an external eavesdropper (IC-CM-EE). We show that for the $K$-user IC-EE, $\frac{1}{2} (\sqrt{K} -3) $ SDoF is achievable, and for the $K$-user IC-CM-EE, $\frac{1}{2} (\sqrt{K} -6) $ is achievable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on the $K$-user interference channel with secrecy constrained models and delayed CSIT that achieves a SDoF which scales with $K$, the number of users.;cs.IT
1801.03516;Parseval&#x27,s Identity and Optimal Transport Maps;Recent findings for optimal transport maps between distribution functions sharing the same copula show that componentwise the solution is the optimal map between marginal distributions. This is an important discovery since in the multivariate setting optimal maps are difficult to find and only known in a few special cases. In this paper, we extend the result on common copulas by showing that orthonormal transformations of variables sharing a common copula also have a known optimal map. We illustrate this by establishing optimal maps between members of a class of scale mixture of normal distributions.;math.PR
1801.03520;Communication-Constrained Expansion Planning for Resilient Distribution Systems;Distributed generation and remotely controlled switches have emerged as important technologies to improve the resiliency of distribution grids against extreme weather-related disturbances. Therefore it becomes impor- tant to study how best to place them on the grid in order to meet a resiliency criteria, while minimizing costs and capturing their dependencies on the associated communication systems that sustains their distributed operations. This paper introduces the Optimal Resilient Design Problem for Distribution and Communi- cation Systems (ORDPDC) to address this need. The ORDPDC is formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer program that captures the physical laws of distribution systems, the communication connec- tivity of the smart grid components, and a set of scenarios which specifies which components are affected by potential disasters. The paper proposes an exact branch-and-price algorithm for the ORDPDC which features a strong lower bound and a variety of acceleration schemes to address degeneracy. The ORDPDC model and branch-and-price algorithm were evaluated on a variety of test cases with varying disaster inten- sities and network topologies. The results demonstrate the significant impact of the network topologies on the expansion plans and costs, as well as the computational benefits of the proposed approach.;math.OC
1801.03527;Multiplication of Distributions and Nonperturbative Calculations of Transition Probabilities;In a mathematical context in which one can multiply distributions the "`formal"' nonperturbative canonical Hamiltonian formalism in Quantum Field Theory makes sense mathematically, which can be understood a priori from the fact the so called "`infinite quantities"' make sense unambiguously (but are not classical real numbers). The perturbation series does not make sense. A novelty appears when one starts to compute the transition probabilities. The transition probabilities have to be computed in a nonperturbative way which, at least in simplified mathematical examples (even those looking like nonrenormalizable series), gives real values between 0 and 1 capable to represent probabilities. However these calculations should be done numerically and we have only been able to compute simplified mathematical examples due to the fact these calculations appear very demanding in the physically significant situation with an infinite dimensional Fock space and the QFT operators.;math-ph
1801.03536;On B. Moss&#xe9,&#x27,s unilateral recognizability theorem;We complete statement and proof for B. Moss\'e's unilateral recognizability theorem. We also provide an algorithm for deciding the unilateral non-recognizability of a given primitive substitution.;math.DS
1801.03538;On Monotonous Separately Continuous Functions;Let ${\mathbb T}=({\bf T},\leq)$ and ${\mathbb T}_{1}=({\bf T}_{1},\leq_{1})$ be linearly ordered sets and $\mathscr{X}$ be a topological space. The main result of the paper is the following: <br />If function $\boldsymbol{f}(t,x):{\bf T}\times\mathscr{X}\mapsto{\bf T}_{1}$ is continuous in each variable ("$t$"and "$x$") separately and function $\boldsymbol{f}_{x}(t)=\boldsymbol{f}(t,x)$ is monotonous on ${\bf T}$ for every $x\in\mathscr{X}$, then $\boldsymbol{f}$ is continuous mapping from ${\bf T}\times\mathscr{X}$ to ${\bf T}_{1}$, where ${\bf T}$ and ${\bf T}_{1}$ are considered as topological spaces under the order topology and ${\bf T}\times\mathscr{X}$ is considered as topological space under the Tychonoff topology on the Cartesian product of topological spaces ${\bf T}$ and $\mathscr{X}$.;math.GM
1801.03543;Quantum current algebras associated with rational $R$-matrix;We study quantum current algebra $\textrm{A}(\overline{R})$ associated with the rational $R$-matrix of $\mathfrak{gl}_N$ and we give explicit formulae for the elements of its center at the critical level. Due to Etingof--Kazhdan's construction, the level $c$ vacuum module $\mathcal{V}_c(\overline{R})$ for the algebra $\textrm{A}(\overline{R})$ possesses a quantum vertex algebra structure for any complex number $c$. We prove that any module for the quantum vertex algebra $\mathcal{V}_c(\overline{R})$ is naturally equipped with a structure of restricted $\textrm{A}(\overline{R})$-module of level $c$ and vice versa.;math.QA
1801.03548;On strong $L^2$ convergence of time numerical schemes for the stochastic 2D Navier-Stokes equations;We prove that some discretization schemes for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations subject to a random perturbation converge in $L^2(\Omega)$. This refines previous results which only established the convergence in probability of these numerical approximations. Using exponential moment estimates of the solution of the stochastic NS equations and convergence of a localized scheme, we can prove strong convergence of fully implicit and semi-implicit time Euler discretizations, and of a splitting scheme. The speed of the $L^2(\Omega)$-convergence depends on the diffusion coefficient and on the viscosity parameter.;math.PR
1801.03549;$E_{2}$ Structures and Derived Koszul Duality in String Topology;We construct an equivalence of $E_{2}$ algebras between two models for the Thom spectrum of the free loop space that are related by derived Koszul duality. To do this, we describe the functoriality and invariance properties of topological Hochschild cohomology.;math.AT
1801.03553;On the Noise-Information Separation of a Private Principal Component Analysis Scheme;In a survey disclosure model, we consider an additive noise privacy mechanism and study the trade-off between privacy guarantees and statistical utility. Privacy is approached from two different but complementary viewpoints: information and estimation theoretic. Motivated by the performance of principal component analysis, statistical utility is measured via the spectral gap of a certain covariance matrix. This formulation and its motivation rely on classical results from random matrix theory. We prove some properties of this statistical utility function and discuss a simple numerical method to evaluate it.;cs.IT
1801.03557;Rate Selection and Power Adaptation using Maximal Ratio Combining for the Random Access Gaussian Channel;With the emergence of machine-driven communi- cation, there is a renewed interest in the design of random multiple access schemes for networks with large number of active devices. Many of the recently proposed access paradigms are enhancements to slotted ALOHA. One of the popular schemes, irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA), is based on an analogy between multiple access with successive interference cancellation and message-passing decoding on bipartite graphs. Most of the results on IRSA and its variants focus on the collision channel and they ignore physical limitations such as transmit power constraints and additive Gaussian noise at the physical layer. As such, naive extensions of IRSA to the Gaussian multiple access channel are not power efficient in the low signal-to-noise- ratio regime. This work introduces a novel paradigm whereby devices adapt their rates and/or transmit powers based on their chosen repetition profiles. The receiver performs maximal ratio combining over all the replicas prior to decoding a message. Numerical results for finite number of users show that the proposed scheme can provide substantial improvements in terms of power efficiency and average rate over standard IRSA.;cs.IT
1801.03572;Learning Aided Optimization for Energy Harvesting Devices with Outdated State Information;This paper considers utility optimal power control for energy harvesting wireless devices with a finite capacity battery. The distribution information of the underlying wireless environment and harvestable energy is unknown and only outdated system state information is known at the device controller. This scenario shares similarity with Lyapunov opportunistic optimization and online learning but is different from both. By a novel combination of Zinkevich's online gradient learning technique and the drift-plus-penalty technique from Lyapunov opportunistic optimization, this paper proposes a learning-aided algorithm that achieves utility within $O(\epsilon)$ of the optimal, for any desired $\epsilon&gt,0$, by using a battery with an $O(1/\epsilon)$ capacity. The proposed algorithm has low complexity and makes power investment decisions based on system history, without requiring knowledge of the system state or its probability distribution.;math.OC
1801.03573;Hyperbolic systems with non-diagonalisable principal part and variable multiplicities, I. Well-posedness;In this paper we analyse the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for a rather general class of hyperbolic systems with space-time dependent coefficients and with multiple characteristics of variable multiplicity. First, we establish a well-posedness result in anisotropic Sobolev spaces for systems with upper triangular principal part under interesting natural conditions on the orders of lower order terms below the diagonal. Namely, the terms below the diagonal at a distance $k$ to it must be of order $-k$. This setting also allows for the Jordan block structure in the system. Second, we give conditions for the Schur type triangularisation of general systems with variable coefficients for reducing them to the form with an upper triangular principal part for which the first result can be applied. We give explicit details for the appearing conditions and constructions for $2\times 2$ and $3\times 3$ systems, complemented by several examples.;math.AP
1801.03575;The Structure of the Three-Dimensional Special Linear Group over a Local Field;For K a local field, it is shown that SL3(K) acts on a simply connected two dimensional simplicial complex in which a single face serves as a fundamental domain. From this it follows that SL3(K) is the generalized amalgamated product of three subgroups. Specifically if K is the field of fractions of the discrete valuation ring O, then SL3(K) is the amalgamation of three subgroups isomorphic to SL3(O) along pairwise intersections. This generalizes a theorem of Ihara, which gives the structure of SL2(K) as the amalgamated product of two groups in analogous fashion.;math.GR
1801.03576;Analyticity of dissipative-dispersive systems in higher dimensions;We investigate the analyticity of the attractors of a class of Kuramoto-Sivashinsky type pseudo-differential equations in higher dimensions, which are periodic in all spatial variables and possess a universal attractor. This is done by fine-tuning the techniques used in a previous work of the second author, which are based on an analytic extensibility criterion involving the growth of $\nabla^n u$, as $n$ tends to infinity (here $u$ is the solution). These techniques can now be utilised in a variety of higher dimensional equations possessing universal attractors, including Topper--Kawahara equation, Frenkel--Indireshkumar equations and their dispersively modified analogs. We prove that the solutions are analytic whenever $\gamma$, the order of dissipation of the pseudo-differential operator, is higher than one. We believe that this estimate is optimal, based on numerical evidence.;math.AP
1801.03591;Characterization and Approximation of Strong General Dual Feasible Functions;Dual feasible functions (DFFs) have been used to provide bounds for standard packing problems and valid inequalities for integer optimization problems. In this paper, the connection between general DFFs and a particular family of cut-generating functions is explored. We find the characterization of (restricted/strongly) maximal general DFFs and prove a 2-slope theorem for extreme general DFFs. We show that any restricted maximal general DFF can be well approximated by an extreme general DFF.;math.OC
1801.03592;Estimation of the Robin coefficient field in a Poisson problem with uncertain conductivity field;We consider the reconstruction of a heterogeneous coefficient field in a Robin boundary condition on an inaccessible part of the boundary in a Poisson problem with an uncertain (or unknown) inhomogeneous conductivity field in the interior of the domain. To account for model errors that stem from the uncertainty in the conductivity coefficient, we treat the unknown conductivity as a nuisance parameter and carry out approximative premarginalization over it, and invert for the Robin coefficient field only. We approximate the related modelling errors via the Bayesian approximation error (BAE) approach. The uncertainty analysis presented here relies on a local linearization of the parameter-to-observable map at the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates, which leads to a normal (Gaussian) approximation of the parameter posterior density. To compute the MAP point we apply an inexact Newton conjugate gradient approach based on the adjoint methodology. The construction of the covariance is made tractable by invoking a low-rank approximation of the data misfit component of the Hessian. Two numerical experiments are considered: one where the prior covariance on the conductivity is isotropic, and one where the prior covariance on the conductivity is anisotropic. Results are compared to those based on standard error models, with particular emphasis on the feasibility of the posterior uncertainty estimates. We show that the BAE approach is a feasible one in the sense that the predicted posterior uncertainty is consistent with the actual estimation errors, while neglecting the related modelling error yields infeasible estimates for the Robin coefficient. In addition, we demonstrate that the BAE approach is approximately as computationally expensive (measured in the number of PDE solves) as the conventional error approach.;math.OC
1801.03594;Finite Blocklength and Dispersion Bounds for the Arbitrarily-Varying Channel;Finite blocklength and second-order (dispersion) results are presented for the arbitrarily-varying channel (AVC), a classical model wherein an adversary can transmit arbitrary signals into the channel. A novel finite blocklength achievability bound is presented, roughly analogous to the random coding union bound for non-adversarial channels. This finite blocklength bound, along with a known converse bound, is used to derive bounds on the dispersion of discrete memoryless AVCs without shared randomness, and with cost constraints on the input and the state. These bounds are tight for many channels of interest, including the binary symmetric AVC. However, the bounds are not tight if the deterministic and random code capacities differ.;cs.IT
1801.03595;Efficient Local Map Search Algorithms for the Placement of Flying Relays;This paper studies the optimal unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) placement problem for wireless networking. The UAV operates as a flying wireless relay to provide coverage extension for a base station (BS) and deliver capacity boost to a user shadowed by obstacles. While existing methods rely on statistical models for potential blockage of a direct propagation link, we propose an approach capable of leveraging local terrain information to offer performance guarantees. The proposed method allows to strike the best trade-off between minimizing propagation distances to ground terminals and discovering good propagation conditions. The algorithm only requires several propagation parameters, but it is capable to avoid deep propagation shadowing and is proven to find the globally optimal UAV position. Only a local exploration over the target area is required, and the maximum length of search trajectory is linear to the geographical scale. Hence, it lends itself to online search. Significant throughput gains are found when compared to other positioning approaches based on statistical propagation models.;cs.IT
1801.03599;On the signed Euler characteristic property for subvarieties of abelian varieties;We give an elementary proof of the fact that a pure-dimensional closed subvariety of a complex abelian variety has a signed intersection homology Euler characteristic. We also show that such subvarieties which, moreover, are local complete intersections, have a signed Euler-Poincare characteristic. Our arguments rely on the construction of circle-valued Morse functions on such spaces, and use in an essential way the stratified Morse theory of Goresky-MacPherson. Our approach also applies (with only minor modifications) for proving similar statements in the analytic context, i.e., for subvarieties of compact complex tori. Alternative proofs of our results can be given by using the general theory of perverse sheaves.;math.AT
1801.03600;Multi-Level Stochastic Gradient Methods for Nested Composition Optimization;Stochastic gradient methods are scalable for solving large-scale optimization problems that involve empirical expectations of loss functions. Existing results mainly apply to optimization problems where the objectives are one- or two-level expectations. In this paper, we consider the multi-level compositional optimization problem that involves compositions of multi-level component functions and nested expectations over a random path. It finds applications in risk-averse optimization and sequential planning. We propose a class of multi-level stochastic gradient methods that are motivated from the method of multi-timescale stochastic approximation. First we propose a basic $T$-level stochastic compositional gradient algorithm, establish its almost sure convergence and obtain an $n$-iteration error bound $O (n^{-1/2^T})$. Then we develop accelerated multi-level stochastic gradient methods by using an extrapolation-interpolation scheme to take advantage of the smoothness of individual component functions. When all component functions are smooth, we show that the convergence rate improves to $O(n^{-4/(7+T)})$ for general objectives and $O (n^{-4/(3+T)})$ for strongly convex objectives. We also provide almost sure convergence and rate of convergence results for nonconvex problems. The proposed methods and theoretical results are validated using numerical experiments.;math.OC
1801.03602;Closed formulas for exponential sums of symmetric polynomials over Galois fields;Exponential sums have applications to a variety of scientific fields, including, but not limited to, cryptography, coding theory and information theory. Closed formulas for exponential sums of symmetric Boolean functions were found by Cai, Green and Thierauf in the late 1990's. Their closed formulas imply that these exponential sums are linear recursive. The linear recursivity of these sums has been exploited in numerous papers and has been used to compute the asymptotic behavior of such sequences. In this article, we extend the result of Cai, Green and Thierauf, that is, we find closed formulas for exponential sums of symmetric polynomials over any Galois fields. Our result also implies that the recursive nature of these sequences is not unique to the binary field, as they are also linear recursive over any finite field. In fact, we provide explicit linear recurrences with integer coefficients for such sequences. As a byproduct of our results, we discover a link between exponential sums of symmetric polynomials over Galois fields and a problem for multinomial coefficients which similar to the problem of bisecting binomial coefficients.;math.CO
1801.03607;Quadrature compressive sampling SAR imaging;This paper presents a quadrature compressive sampling (QuadCS) and associated fast imaging scheme for synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Different from other analog-to-information conversions (AIC), QuadCS AICs using independent spreading signals sample the SAR echoes due to different transmitted pulses. Then the resulting sensing matrix has lower correlation between any two columns than that by a fixed spreading signal, and better SAR image can be reconstructed. With proper setting of the spreading signals in QuadCS, the sensing matrix has the structures suitable for fast computation of matrix-vector multiplication operations, which leads to the fast image reconstruction. The performance of the proposed scheme is assessed using real SAR image. The reconstructed SAR images with only one-fourth of the Nyquist data achieve the image quality similar to that of the classical SAR images with Nyquist samples.;cs.IT
1801.03616;Parity-Check Polar Coding for 5G and Beyond;In this paper, we propose a comprehensive Polar coding solution that integrates reliability calculation, rate matching and parity-check coding. Judging a channel coding design from the industry's viewpoint, there are two primary concerns: (i) low-complexity implementation in application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), and (ii) superior \&amp, stable performance under a wide range of code lengths and rates. The former provides cost- \&amp, power-efficiency which are vital to any commercial system, the latter ensures flexible and robust services. Our design respects both criteria. It demonstrates better performance than existing schemes in literature, but requires only a fraction of implementation cost. With easily-reproducible code construction for arbitrary code rates and lengths, we are able to report "1-bit" fine-granularity simulation results for thousands of cases. The released results can serve as a baseline for future optimization of Polar codes.;cs.IT
1801.03619;RAF: Robust Adaptive Multi-Feedback Channel Estimation for Millimeter Wave MIMO Systems;Millimeter wave is a promising technology for the next generation of wireless systems. As it is well-known for its high path loss, the systems working in this spectrum tend to exploit the shorter wavelength to equip the transceivers with a large number of antennas to overcome the path loss issue. The large number of antennas leads to large channel matrices and consequently a challenging channel estimation problem. The channel estimation algorithms that have been proposed so far either neglect the probability of estimation error or require a high feedback overload from receivers to ensure the target probability of estimation error. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage adaptive channel estimation algorithm called robust adaptive multi-feedback (RAF). The algorithm is based on using the estimated channel coefficient to predict a lower bound for the required number of measurements. Our simulations demonstrate that compared with existing algorithms, RAF can achieve the desired probability of estimation error while on average reducing the feedback overhead by 75.5% and the total channel estimation time by 14%.;cs.IT
1801.03623;Optimal locally repairable codes of distance $3$ and $4$ via cyclic codes;Like classical block codes, a locally repairable code also obeys the Singleton-type bound (we call a locally repairable code {\it optimal} if it achieves the Singleton-type bound). In the breakthrough work of \cite{TB14}, several classes of optimal locally repairable codes were constructed via subcodes of Reed-Solomon codes. Thus, the lengths of the codes given in \cite{TB14} are upper bounded by the code alphabet size $q$. Recently, it was proved through extension of construction in \cite{TB14} that length of $q$-ary optimal locally repairable codes can be $q+1$ in \cite{JMX17}. Surprisingly, \cite{BHHMV16} presented a few examples of $q$-ary optimal locally repairable codes of small distance and locality with code length achieving roughly $q^2$. Very recently, it was further shown in \cite{LMX17} that there exist $q$-ary optimal locally repairable codes with length bigger than $q+1$ and distance propositional to $n$. <br />Thus, it becomes an interesting and challenging problem to construct new families of $q$-ary optimal locally repairable codes of length bigger than $q+1$. <br />In this paper, we construct a class of optimal locally repairable codes of distance $3$ and $4$ with unbounded length (i.e., length of the codes is independent of the code alphabet size). Our technique is through cyclic codes with particular generator and parity-check polynomials that are carefully chosen.;cs.IT

1801.03641;To Relay or not to Relay: Open Distance and Optimal Deployment for Linear Underwater Acoustic Networks;Existing works have widely studied relay-aided underwater acoustic networks under some specialized relay distributions, e.g., equidistant and rectangular-grid. In this paper, we investigate two fundamental problems that under which conditions a relay should be deployed and where to deploy it if necessary in terms of the energy and delay performance in linear underwater acoustic networks. To address these two problems, we first accurately approximate the complicated effective bandwidth and transmit power in the logarithm domain to formulate an energy minimization problem. By analyzing the formulation, we discover a critical transmission distance, defined as open distance, and explicitly show that a relay should not be deployed if the transmission distance is less than the open distance and should be otherwise. Most importantly, we derive a closed-form and easy-to-calculate expression for the open distance and also strictly prove that the optimal placing position is at the middle point of the link when a relay should be introduced. Moreover, although this paper considers a linear two-hop relay network as the first step, our derived results can be applied to construct energy-efficient and delay-friendly multi-hop networks. Simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and show that properly introducing a relay can dramatically reduce the network energy consumption almost without increasing the end-to-end delay.;cs.IT
1801.03647;On sums of weighted averages of $\gcd$-sum functions;Let $\gcd(j,k)$ be the greatest common divisor of the integers $j$ and $k$. In this paper, we give several interesting asymptotic formulas for weighted averages of the $\gcd$-sum function $f(\gcd(j,k)) $ and the function $\sum_{d|k, d^{s}|j}(f*\mu)(d) $ for any positive integers $j$ and $k$, namely $$ \sum_{k\leq x}\frac{1}{k^{r+1}}\sum_{j=1}^{k}j^{r}f(\gcd(j,k)) \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{k\leq x}\frac{1}{k^{s(r+1)}}\sum_{j=1}^{k^s}j^{r} \sum_{\substack{d|k d^{s}|j}}(f*\mu)(d), $$ with any fixed integer $s&gt, 1$ and any arithmetical function $f$. We also establish mean value formulas for the error terms of asymptotic formulas for partial sums of $\gcd$-sum functions $f(\gcd(j,k)). $;math.NT
1801.03653;Sums of weighted averages of gcd-sum functions II;In this paper, we establish the following two identities involving the Gamma function and Bernoulli polynomials, namely $$ \sum_{k\leq x}\frac{1}{k^s} \sum_{j=1}^{k^s}\log\Gamma\left(\frac{j}{k^s}\right) <br />\sum_{\substack{d|k \\ d^{s}|j}}f*\mu(d) \quad {\rm and } \quad \sum_{k\leq x}\frac{1}{k^s}\sum_{j=0}^{k^{s}-1} <br />B_{m}\sum_{\substack{d|k \\ d^{s}|j}} f*\mu(d) $$ with any fixed integer $s&gt, 1$ and any arithmetical function $f$. We give asymptotic formulas for them with various multiplicative functions $f$. We also consider several formulas of the Dirichlet series associated with the above identities. This paper is a continuation of an earlier work of the authors.;math.NT
1801.03654;Proving some identities of Gosper on $q$-trigonometric functions;Gosper introduced the functions $\sin_q z$ and $\cos_q z$ as $q$-analogues for the trigonometric functions $\sin z$ and $\cos z$ respectively. He stated but did not prove a variety of identities involving these two $q$-trigonometric functions. In this paper, we shall use the theory of elliptic functions to prove three formulas from the list of Gosper on the functions $\sin_q z$ and $\cos_q z$.;math.NT
1801.03655;Can Negligible Cooperation Increase Network Capacity? The Average-Error Case;In communication networks, cooperative strategies are coding schemes where network nodes work together to improve network performance metrics such as sum-rate. This work studies encoder cooperation in the setting of a discrete multiple access channel with two encoders and a single decoder. A node in the network that is connected to both encoders via rate-limited links, referred to as the cooperation facilitator (CF), enables the cooperation strategy. Previously, the authors presented a class of multiple access channels where the average-error sum-capacity has an infinite derivative in the limit where CF output link capacities approach zero. The authors also demonstrated that for some channels, the maximal-error sum-capacity is not continuous at the point where the output link capacities of the CF equal zero. This work shows that the the average-error sum-capacity is continuous when CF output link capacities converge to zero, that is, the infinite derivative of the average-error sum-capacity is not a result of its discontinuity as in the maximal-error case.;cs.IT
1801.03656;Quantum Encryption and Generalized Quantum Shannon Impossibility;The famous Shannon impossibility result says that any encryption scheme with perfect secrecy requires a secret key at least as long as the message. In this paper we provide its quantum analogue with imperfect secrecy and imperfect correctness. We also give a systematic study of information-theoretically secure quantum encryption with two secrecy definitions. We show that the weaker one implies the stronger but with a security loss in $d$, where $d$ is the dimension of the encrypted quantum system. This is good enough if the target secrecy error is of $o(d^{-1})$.;cs.IT

1801.03663;From Uncertainty Data to Robust Policies for Temporal Logic Planning;We consider the problem of synthesizing robust disturbance feedback policies for systems performing complex tasks. We formulate the tasks as linear temporal logic specifications and encode them into an optimization framework via mixed-integer constraints. Both the system dynamics and the specifications are known but affected by uncertainty. The distribution of the uncertainty is unknown, however realizations can be obtained. We introduce a data-driven approach where the constraints are fulfilled for a set of realizations and provide probabilistic generalization guarantees as a function of the number of considered realizations. We use separate chance constraints for the satisfaction of the specification and operational constraints. This allows us to quantify their violation probabilities independently. We compute disturbance feedback policies as solutions of mixed-integer linear or quadratic optimization problems. By using feedback we can exploit information of past realizations and provide feasibility for a wider range of situations compared to static input sequences. We demonstrate the proposed method on two robust motion-planning case studies for autonomous driving.;math.OC
1801.03668;Asynchronous Mobile-Edge Computation Offloading: Energy-Efficient Resource Management;Mobile-edge computation offloading (MECO) is an emerging technology for enhancing mobiles' computation capabilities and prolonging their battery lives, by offloading intensive computation from mobiles to nearby servers such as base stations. In this paper, we study the energy-efficient resource-management policy for the asynchronous MECO system, where the mobiles have heterogeneous input-data arrival time instants and computation deadlines. First, we consider the general case with arbitrary arrival-deadline orders. Based on the monomial energy-consumption model for data transmission, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the total mobile-energy consumption under the time-sharing and computation-deadline constraints. The optimal resource-management policy for data partitioning (for offloading and local computing) and time division (for transmissions) is shown to be computed by using the block coordinate decent method. To gain further insights, we study the optimal resource-management design for two special cases. First, consider the case of identical arrival-deadline orders, i.e., a mobile with input data arriving earlier also needs to complete computation earlier. The optimization problem is reduced to two sequential problems corresponding to the optimal scheduling order and joint data-partitioning and time-division given the optimal order. It is found that the optimal time-division policy tends to balance the defined effective computing power among offloading mobiles via time sharing. Furthermore, this solution approach is extended to the case of reverse arrival-deadline orders. The corresponding time-division policy is derived by a proposed transformation-and-scheduling approach, which first determines the total offloading duration and data size for each mobile in the transformation phase and then specifies the offloading intervals for each mobile in the scheduling phase.;cs.IT
1801.03673;Ecologically Sustainable Partitioning of a Metapopulations Network;A stable population network is hard to interrupt without any ecological consequences. A communication blockage between patches may destabilize the populations in the ecological network. This work deals with the construction of a safe cut passing through metapopulations habitat such that populations remain stable. We combine the dynamical system stability analysis with graph partitioning algorithms in our approach to the problem. It finds such a safe construction, when one exists, provided the algebraic connectivity of the graph components is stronger than all the spatially local instabilities in the respective components. The dynamics of the populations on the spatially discrete patches (graph nodes) and their spatial communication with other patches is modeled as a reaction-diffusion system. By reversing the Turing-instability idea the stability conditions of the partitioned system are found to depend on local dynamics of the metapopulations and the Fiedler value of the Laplacian matrix of the graph. This leads to the necessary and sufficient conditions for removal of the graph edges subject to the stability of the partitioned graph networks. An heuristic bisection graph partitioning algorithm has been proposed and examples illustrate the theoretical result.;math.DS
1801.03677;Algebras with irreducible module varieties II: Two vertex case;We call a finite-dimensional K-algebra A geometrically irreducible if for all d all connected components of the affine scheme of d-dimensional A-modules are irreducible. We prove that a geometrically irreducible algebra with exactly two simple modules has to be of a very special form, which we describe. Based on this result we prove that every minimal geometrically irreducible algebra without shortcuts in its Gabriel quiver has at most two simple modules.;math.RT
1801.03682;Diffusion limits for a Markov modulated binomial counting process;In this paper we study limit behavior for a Markov-modulated (MM) binomial counting process, also called a binomial counting process under regime switching. Such a process naturally appears in the context of credit risk when multiple obligors are present. Markov-modulation takes place when the failure/default rate of each individual obligor depends on an underlying Markov chain. The limit behavior under consideration occurs when the number of obligors increases unboundedly, and/or by accelerating the modulating Markov process, called rapid switching. We establish diffusion approximations, obtained by application of (semi)martingale central limit theorems. Depending on the specific circumstances, different approximations are found.;math.PR
1801.03687;On the Reliability Function of Distributed Hypothesis Testing Under Optimal Detection;The distributed hypothesis testing problem with full side-information is studied. The trade-off (reliability function) between the two types of error exponents under limited rate is studied in the following way. First, the problem is reduced to the problem of determining the reliability function of channel codes designed for detection (in analogy to a similar result which connects the reliability function of distributed lossless compression and ordinary channel codes). Second, a single-letter random-coding bound based on a hierarchical ensemble, as well as a single-letter expurgated bound, are derived for the reliability of channel-detection codes. Both bounds are derived for a system which employs the optimal detection rule. We conjecture that the resulting random-coding bound is ensemble-tight, and consequently optimal within the class of quantization-and-binning schemes.;cs.IT
1801.03701;Oscillatory regimes in a mosquito population model with larval feedback on egg hatching;Understanding mosquitoes life cycle is of great interest presently because of the increasing impact of vector borne diseases in several countries. There is evidence of oscillations in mosquito populations independent of seasonality, still unexplained, based on observations both in laboratories and in nature. We propose a simple mathematical model of egg hatching enhancement by larvae which produces such oscillations that conveys a possible explanation. We propose both a theoretical analysis, based on slow-fast dynamics and Hopf bifurcation, and numerical investigations in order to shed some light on the mechanisms at work in this model.;math.DS
1801.03705;Exact Calculation of Normalized Maximum Likelihood Code Length Using Fourier Analysis;The normalized maximum likelihood code length has been widely used in model selection, and its favorable properties, such as its consistency and the upper bound of its statistical risk, have been demonstrated. This paper proposes a novel methodology for calculating the normalized maximum likelihood code length on the basis of Fourier analysis. Our methodology provides an efficient non-asymptotic calculation formula for exponential family models and an asymptotic calculation formula for general parametric models with a weaker assumption compared to that in previous work.;math.ST
1801.03706;Energy conditions and twisted localizations of operators;We show that the energy conditions are not necessary for boundedness of fractional Riesz transforms in dimension at least 2.

1801.03714;Multi-Band Covariance Interpolation with Applications in Massive MIMO;In this paper, we study the problem of multi-band (frequency-variant) covariance interpolation with a particular emphasis towards massive MIMO applications. In a massive MIMO system, the communication between each BS with $M \gg 1$ antennas and each single-antenna user occurs through a collection of scatterers in the environment, where the channel vector of each user at BS antennas consists in a weighted linear combination of the array responses of the scatterers, where each scatterer has its own angle of arrival (AoA) and complex channel gain. The array response at a given AoA depends on the wavelength of the incoming planar wave and is naturally frequency dependent. This results in a frequency-dependent distortion where the second order statistics, i.e., the covariance matrix, of the channel vectors varies with frequency. In this paper, we show that although this effect is generally negligible for a small number of antennas $M$, it results in a considerable distortion of the covariance matrix and especially its dominant signal subspace in the massive MIMO regime where $M \to \infty$, and can generally incur a serious degradation of the performance especially in frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive MIMO systems where the uplink (UL) and the downlink (DL) communication occur over different frequency bands. We propose a novel UL-DL covariance interpolation technique that is able to recover the covariance matrix in the DL from an estimate of the covariance matrix in the UL under a mild reciprocity condition on the angular power spread function (PSF) of the users. We analyze the performance of our proposed scheme mathematically and prove its robustness under a sufficiently large spatial oversampling of the array. We also propose several simple off-the-shelf algorithms for UL-DL covariance interpolation and evaluate their performance via numerical simulations.;cs.IT
1801.03716;Functoriality of the EH class and the LOSS invariant under Lagrangian concordances;We show that the EH class and the LOSS invariant of Legendrian knots in contact 3-manifolds are functorial under regular Lagrangian concordances in Weinstein cobordisms. This gives computable obstructions to the existence of regular Lagrangian concordances.;math.GT
1801.03717;How to Split UL/DL Antennas in Full-Duplex Cellular Networks;To further improve the potential of full-duplex communications, networks may employ multiple antennas at the base station or user equipment. To this end, networks that employ current radios usually deal with self-interference and multi-user interference by beamforming techniques. Although previous works investigated beamforming design to improve spectral efficiency, the fundamental question of how to split the antennas at a base station between uplink and downlink in full-duplex networks has not been investigated rigorously. This paper addresses this question by posing antenna splitting as a binary nonlinear optimization problem to minimize the sum mean squared error of the received data symbols. It is shown that this is an NP-hard problem. This combinatorial problem is dealt with by equivalent formulations, iterative convex approximations, and a binary relaxation. The proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a stationary solution of the relaxed problem with much smaller complexity than exhaustive search. Numerical results indicate that the proposed solution is close to the optimal in both high and low self-interference capable scenarios, while the usually assumed antenna splitting is far from optimal. For large number of antennas, a simple antenna splitting is close to the proposed solution. This reveals that the importance of antenna splitting is inversely proportional with the number of antennas.;cs.IT
1801.03728;Enhancing Physical Layer Security in AF Relay Assisted Multi-Carrier Wireless Transmission;In this paper, we study the physical layer security (PLS) problem in the dual hop orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based wireless communication system. First, we consider a single user single relay system and study a joint power optimization problem at the source and relay subject to individual power constraint at the two nodes. The aim is to maximize the end to end secrecy rate with optimal power allocation over different sub-carriers. Later, we consider a more general multi-user multi-relay scenario. Under high SNR approximation for end to end secrecy rate, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize power allocation at the BS, the relay selection, sub-carrier assignment to users and the power loading at each of the relaying node. The target is to maximize the overall security of the system subject to independent power budget limits at each transmitting node and the OFDMA based exclusive sub-carrier allocation constraints. A joint optimization solution is obtained through duality theory. Dual decomposition allows to exploit convex optimization techniques to find the power loading at the source and relay nodes. Further, an optimization for power loading at relaying nodes along with relay selection and sub carrier assignment for the fixed power allocation at the BS is also studied. Lastly, a sub-optimal scheme that explores joint power allocation at all transmitting nodes for the fixed subcarrier allocation and relay assignment is investigated. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate the performance of the proposed schemes.;cs.IT

Our goal is to find non-trivial solutions in the variables x_i, 1\leq i\leq 3, all of size about P, assuming that \tet is sufficiently large. We study this problem on average over \alp_3 and generalize previous work of Bourgain on quadratic ternary diagonal forms to general degree k.;math.NT
1801.03739;A Stochastic Pitchfork Bifurcation in Most Probable Phase Portraits;We study stochastic bifurcation for a system under multiplicative stable Levy noise (an important class of non-Gaussian noise), by examining the qualitative changes of equilibrium states in its most probable phase portraits. We have found some peculiar bifurcation phenomena in contrast to the deterministic counterpart: (i) When the non-Gaussianity parameter in Levy noise varies, there is either one, two or none backward pitchfork type bifurcations, (ii) When a parameter in the vector field varies, there are two or three forward pitchfork bifurcations, (iii) The non-Gaussian Levy noise clearly leads to fundamentally more complex bifurcation scenarios, since in the special case of Gaussian noise, there is only one pitchfork bifurcation which is reminiscent of the deterministic situation.;math.DS
1801.03741;Double asymptotic for random walks on hypercubes;We consider the sum of the coordinates of a simple random walk on the K-dimensional hypercube, and prove a double asymptotic of this process, as both the time parameter n and the space parameter K tend to infinity. Depending on the asymptotic ratio of the two parameters, they converge towards either a Brownian motion, an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process or an i.i.d. collection of Gaussian variables.;math.PR
1801.03742;Quantization/clustering: when and why does k-means work?;Though mostly used as a clustering algorithm, k-means are originally designed as a quantization algorithm. Namely, it aims at providing a compression of a probability distribution with k points. Building upon [21, 33], we try to investigate how and when these two approaches are compatible. Namely, we show that provided the sample distribution satisfies a margin like condition (in the sense of [27] for supervised learning), both the associated empirical risk minimizer and the output of Lloyd's algorithm provide almost optimal classification in certain cases (in the sense of [6]). Besides, we also show that they achieved fast and optimal convergence rates in terms of sample size and compression risk.;math.ST
1801.03748;Performance Evaluation of Advanced Relaying Protocols in Large Wireless Networks;This paper studies the performance of some state-of-the-art cooperative full-duplex relaying protocols in the context of a large wireless network modelled using stochastic geometry tools. We investigate the outage behaviour for different cooperative schemes, namely, decode-and-forward, noisy-network coding and mixed noisy-network coding, considering fading, path loss and interference from other sources and relays. Due to the high complexity of the network topology and the protocols considered, a closed-form analysis is not possible, so our study is performed through extensive but careful numerical simulations, sweeping a large number of relevant parameters. Several scenarios of particular interest are investigated. In this way, insightful conclusions are drawn regarding the network regimes in which relay-assisted cooperation is most beneficial and the potential gains that could be achieved through it.;cs.IT
1801.03749;Improved asynchronous parallel optimization analysis for stochastic incremental methods;As datasets continue to increase in size and multi-core computer architectures are developed, asynchronous parallel optimization algorithms become more and more essential to the field of Machine Learning. Unfortunately, conducting the theoretical analysis asynchronous methods is difficult, notably due to the introduction of delay and inconsistency in inherently sequential algorithms. Handling these issues often requires resorting to simplifying but unrealistic assumptions. Through a novel perspective, we revisit and clarify a subtle but important technical issue present in a large fraction of the recent convergence rate proofs for asynchronous parallel optimization algorithms, and propose a simplification of the recently introduced "perturbed iterate" framework that resolves it. We demonstrate the usefulness of our new framework by analyzing three distinct asynchronous parallel incremental optimization algorithms: Hogwild (asynchronous SGD), KROMAGNON (asynchronous SVRG) and ASAGA, a novel asynchronous parallel version of the incremental gradient algorithm SAGA that enjoys fast linear convergence rates. We are able to both remove problematic assumptions and obtain better theoretical results. Notably, we prove that ASAGA and KROMAGNON can obtain a theoretical linear speedup on multi-core systems even without sparsity assumptions. We present results of an implementation on a 40-core architecture illustrating the practical speedups as well as the hardware overhead. Finally, we investigate the overlap constant, an ill-understood but central quantity for the theoretical analysis of asynchronous parallel algorithms. We find that it encompasses much more complexity than suggested in previous work, and often is order-of-magnitude bigger than traditionally thought.;math.OC
1801.03752;Sheaves of categories with local actions of Hochschild cochains;The notion of Hochschild cochains induces an assignment from $Aff$, affine DG schemes, to monoidal DG categories. We show that this assignment extends, under some appropriate finiteness conditions, to a functor $\mathbb H: Aff \to AlgBimod(DGCat)$, where the latter denotes the category of monoidal DG categories and bimodules. Now, any functor $\mathbb A: Aff \to AlgBimod(DGCat)$ gives rise, by taking modules, to a theory of sheaves of categories $ShvCat^{\mathbb A}$. <br />In this paper, we study $ShvCat^{\mathbb H}$. Vaguely speaking, this theory categorifies the theory of D-modules, in the same way as Gaitsgory's original $ShvCat$ categorifies the theory of quasi-coherent sheaves. We develop the functoriality of $ShvCat^{\mathbb H}$, its descent properties and, most importantly, the notion of $\mathbb H$-affineness. We then prove the $\mathbb H$-affineness of algebraic stacks: for $Y$ a stack satisfying some mild conditions, the $\infty$-category $ShvCat^{\mathbb H}(Y)$ is equivalent to the $\infty$-category of modules for $\mathbb H(Y)$, the monoidal DG category defined in <a href="/abs/1709.07867">arXiv:1709.07867</a>. <br />As an application, consider a quasi-smooth stack $Y$ and a DG category $C$ with an action of $\mathbb H(Y)$. Then $C$ admits a theory of singular support in $Sing(Y)$, where $Sing(Y)$ is the space of singularities of $Y$.;math.AG

1801.03760;Estimation of Local Anisotropy Based on Level Sets;Consider an affine Gaussian field X : R 2 $\rightarrow$ R, that is a process equal in law to Z(At), where Z is isotropic and A : R2 $\rightarrow$ R2 is a self-adjoint definite positive matrix. Denote 0 &lt, $\lambda$ = $\lambda$\_2 / $\lambda$\_1 \le 1 the ratio of the eigenvalues of A. This paper is aimed at testing the null hypothesis '' X is isotropic'' versus the alternative '' X is affine''. Roughly speaking, this amounts to testing '' $\lambda$ = 1 '' versus '' $\lambda$ &lt, 1 ''. By setting level u in R, this is implemented by the partial observations of process X through some particular level functionals viewed over a square T, which grows to R2. This leads us to provide estimators for the affinity parameters that are shown to be almost surely consistent. Their asymptotic normality provide confidence intervals for parameters. This paper offered an important opportunity to study general level functionals near the level u, part of the difficulties arises from the fact that the topology of level set CT,X (u) = {t $\in$ T : X(t) = u} can be irregular, even if the trajectories of X are regular. A significant part of the paper is dedicated to show the L2-continuity in the level u of these general functionals.;math.PR

1801.03765;Non-stationary Douglas-Rachford and alternating direction method of multipliers: adaptive stepsizes and convergence;We revisit the classical Douglas-Rachford (DR) method for finding a zero of the sum of two maximal monotone operators. Since the practical performance of the DR method crucially depends on the stepsizes, we aim at developing an adaptive stepsize rule. To that end, we take a closer look at a linear case of the problem and use our findings to develop a stepsize strategy that eliminates the need for stepsize tuning. We analyze a general non-stationary DR scheme and prove its convergence for a convergent sequence of stepsizes with summable increments. This, in turn, proves the convergence of the method with the new adaptive stepsize rule. We also derive the related non-stationary alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) from such a non-stationary DR method. We illustrate the efficiency of the proposed methods on several numerical examples.;math.OC
1801.03770;Koszul-Tate resolutions as cofibrant replacements of algebras over differential operators;Homotopical geometry over differential operators is a convenient setting for a coordinate-free investigation of nonlinear partial differential equations modulo symmetries. One of the first issues one meets in the functor of points approach to homotopical $\mathcal{D}$-geometry, is the question of a model structure on the category $\tt DGAlg(\mathcal{D})$ of differential non-negatively graded $\mathcal{O}$-quasi-coherent sheaves of commutative algebras over the sheaf $\mathcal{D}$ of differential operators of an appropriate underlying variety $(X,\mathcal{O})$. We define a cofibrantly generated model structure on $\tt DGAlg(\mathcal{D})$ via the definition of its weak equivalences and its fibrations, characterize the class of cofibrations, and build an explicit functorial `cofibration - trivial fibration' factorization. We then use the latter to get a functorial model categorical Koszul-Tate resolution for $\mathcal{D}$-algebraic `on-shell function' algebras (which contains the classical Koszul-Tate resolution). The paper is also the starting point for a homotopical $\mathcal{D}$-geometric Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism.;math.AT

Moreover, we establish the mean square exponential stability and quasi sure exponential stability of the solutions be means of G-Lyapunov function method. An example is presented to illustrate the efficiency of the obtained results.;math.PR
1801.03777;On the global well-posedness of a class of 2D solutions for the Rosensweig system of ferrofluids;We study study a class of 2D solutions of a Bloch-Torrey regularization of the Rosensweig system in the whole space, which arise when the initial data and the external magnetic field are 2D. We prove that such solutions are globally defined if the initial data is in $ H^k\left(\mathbb{R}^2\right), k\geqslant 1 $.;math.AP
1801.03780;A Sundaram type bijection for SO(3): vacillating tableaux and pairs of standard Young tableaux and orthogonal Littlewood-Richardson tableaux;Based on the direct-sum-decomposition of the rth tensor power of the defining representation of the special orthogonal group SO(2k+1) one is interested in a bijective approach for determining the Frobenius characters of the isotypic components. In particular this leads us to a bijection between vacillating tableaux and pairs of standard Young tableaux and orthogonal Littlewood-Richardson tableaux, which we present for SO(3). Moreover we introduce the descent set of a vacillating tableau. As our bijection preserves this descent set, we also obtain the quasi-symmetric expansion of the Frobenius characters.;math.CO
1801.03785;Computability of Frames in Computable Hilbert Spaces;Frames play an important role in various practical problems related to signal and image processing. In this paper, we define computable frames in computable Hilbert spaces and obtain computable versions of some of their characterizations. Also, the notion of duality of frames in the context of computability has been studied. Finally, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a computable dual frame is obtained.;math.FA
1801.03786;On a reduction of nonlinear evolution and wave type equations via non-point symmetry method;We study the symmetry reduction of nonlinear evolution and wave type differential equations by using operators of non-point symmetry. In our approach we use both operators of classical and conditional symmetry. It appears that the combination of non-point and conditional symmetry enables us to construct not only solutions but B\"acklund transformations too for the equation under study. We show that the method can be applied to nonevolutionary partial differential equations.;math.AP

1801.03789;$L_1/\ell_1$-to-$L_1/\ell_1$ analysis of linear positive impulsive systems with application to the $L_1/\ell_1$-to-$L_1/\ell_1$ interval observation of linear impulsive and switched systems;Sufficient conditions characterizing the asymptotic stability and the hybrid $L_1/\ell_1$-gain of linear positive impulsive systems under minimum and range dwell-time constraints are obtained. These conditions are stated as infinite-dimensional linear programming problems that can be solved using sum of squares programming, a relaxation that is known to be asymptotically exact in the present case. These conditions are then adapted to formulate constructive and convex sufficient conditions for the existence of $L_1/\ell_1$-to-$L_1/\ell_1$ interval observers for linear impulsive and switched systems. Suitable observer gains can be extracted from the (suboptimal) solution of the infinite-dimensional optimization problem where the $L_1/\ell_1$-gain of the system mapping the disturbances to the weighted observation errors is minimized. Some examples on impulsive and switched systems are given for illustration.;math.OC
1801.03794;Hybrid NOMA-TDMA for Multiple Access Channels with Non-Ideal Batteries and Circuit Cost;We consider a multiple-access channel where the users are powered from batteries having non-negligible internal resistance. When power is drawn from the battery, a variable fraction of the power, which is a function of the power drawn from the battery, is lost across the internal resistance. Hence, the power delivered to the load is less than the power drawn from the battery. The users consume a constant power for the circuit operation during transmission but do not consume any power when not transmitting. In this setting, we obtain the maximum sum-rates and achievable rate regions under various cases. We show that, unlike in the ideal battery case, the TDMA (time-division multiple access) strategy, wherein the users transmit orthogonally in time, may not always achieve the maximum sum-rate when the internal resistance is non-zero. The users may need to adopt a hybrid NOMA-TDMA strategy which combines the features of NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) and TDMA, wherein a set of users are allocated fixed time windows for orthogonal single-user and non-orthogonal joint transmissions, respectively. We also numerically show that the maximum achievable rate regions in NOMA and TDMA strategies are contained within the maximum achievable rate region of the hybrid NOMA-TDMA strategy.;cs.IT
1801.03798;Multipliers of nilpotent Lie superalgebras;In this paper, first we prove that all finite dimensional special Heisenberg Lie superalgebras with even center have same dimension, say $(2m+1\mid n)$ for some non-negative integers $m,n$ and are isomorphism with them. Further, for a nilpotent Lie superalgebra $L$ of dimension $(m\mid n)$ and $\dim (L') = (r\mid s)$ with $r+s \geq 1$, we find the upper bound $\dim \mathcal{M}(L)\leq \frac{1}{2}\left[(m + n + r + s - 2)(m + n - r -s -1) \right] + n + 1$, where $\mathcal{M}(L)$ denotes the Schur multiplier of $L$. Moreover, if $(r, s) =(1, 0)\, (\mathrm{respectively}\, (r,s) = (0,1))$, then the equality holds if and only if $L \cong H(1,0) \oplus A_{1}\, (\mathrm{respectively}\, H(0,1) \oplus A_{2})$, where $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ are abelian Lie superalgebras with $\dim A_{1}=(m-3 \mid n), \dim A_{2}=(m-1 \mid n-1)$ and $H(1,0), H(0,1)$ are special Heisenberg Lie superalgebras of dimension $3$ and $2$ respectively.;math.RA
1801.03807;Iterated integrals on $\mathbb{P}^{1}\setminus\{0,1,\infty,z\}$ and a class of relations among multiple zeta values;In this paper we consider iterated integrals on $\mathbb{P}^{1}\setminus\{0,1,\infty,z\}$ and define a class of $\mathbb{Q}$-linear relations among them, which arises from the differential structure of the iterated integrals with respect to $z$. We then define a new class of $\mathbb{Q}$-linear relations among the multiple zeta values by taking their limits of $z\rightarrow1$, which we call \emph{confluence relations} (i.e., the relations obtained by the confluence of two punctured points). One of the significance of the confluence relations is that it gives a rich family and seems to exhaust all the linear relations among the multiple zeta values. As a good reason for this, we show that confluence relations imply both the regularized double shuffle relations and the duality relations.;math.NT
1801.03810;Magnetic rings;We study functional and spectral properties of perturbations of the magnetic Laplace operator on the circle. This operator appears when considering the restriction to the unit circle of a two-dimensional Schr{\"o}dinger operator with the Bohm-Aharonov vector potential. We prove a Hardy-type inequality on the two-dimensional Euclidean space and, on the circle, a sharp interpolation inequality and a sharp Keller-Lieb-Thirring inequality.;math.AP
1801.03813;Energy Harvesting Communications Using Dual Alternating Batteries;Practical energy harvesting (EH) based communication systems typically use a battery to temporarily store the harvested energy prior to its use for communication. The batteries can be damaged when they are repeatedly charged (discharged) after being partially discharged (charged), overcharged or deeply discharged. This motivates the cycle constraint which says that a battery must be charged (discharged) only after it is sufficiently discharged (charged). We also assume Bernoulli energy arrivals, and a half-duplex constraint due to which the batteries are not charged and discharged simultaneously. In this context, we study EH communication systems with: (a) a single-battery with capacity 2B units and (b) dual-batteries, each having capacity of B units. The aim is to obtain the best possible long-term average throughputs and throughput regions in point-to-point (P2P) channels and multiple access channels (MAC), respectively. For the P2P channel, we obtain an analytical optimal solution in the single-battery case, and propose optimal and sub-optimal power allocation policies for the dual-battery case. We extend these policies to obtain achievable throughput regions in MACs by jointly allocating rates and powers. From numerical simulations, we find that the optimal throughput in the dual-battery case is significantly higher than that in the single-battery case, although the total storage capacity in both cases is 2B units. Further, in the proposed policies, the largest throughput region in the single-battery case is contained within that of the dual-battery case.;cs.IT
1801.03822;W-algebras as coset vertex algebras;We prove the long-standing conjecture on the coset construction of the minimal series principal $W$-algebras of $ADE$ types in full generality. We do this by first establishing Feigin's conjecture on the coset realization of the universal principal $W$-algebras, which are not necessarily simple. As consequences, the unitarity of the "discrete series" of principal $W$-algebras is established, a second coset realization of rational and unitary $W$-algebras of type $A$ and $D$ are given and the rationality of Kazama-Suzuki coset vertex superalgebras is derived.;math.QA
1801.03828;Two-valued local sets of the 2D continuum Gaussian free field: connectivity, labels, and induced metrics;We study two-valued local sets, $\mathbb{A}_{-a,b}$, of the two-dimensional continuum Gaussian free field (GFF) with zero boundary condition in simply connected domains. Intuitively, $\mathbb{A}_{-a,b}$ is the (random) set of points connected to the boundary by a path on which the values of the GFF remain in $[-a,b]$. For specific choices of the parameters $a, b$ the two-valued sets have the law of the CLE$_4$ carpet, the law of the union of level lines between all pairs of boundary points, or, conjecturally, the law of the interfaces of the scaling limit of XOR-Ising model. <br />Two-valued sets are the closure of the union of countably many SLE$_4$ type of loops, where each loop comes with a label equal to either $-a$ or $b$. One of the main results of this paper describes the connectivity properties of these loops. Roughly, we show that all the loops are disjoint if $a+b \geq 4\lambda$, and that their intersection graph is connected if $a + b &lt, 4\lambda$. This also allows us to study the labels (the heights) of the loops. We prove that the labels of the loops are a function of the set $\mathbb{A}_{-a,b}$ if and only if $a\neq b$ and $2\lambda \leq a+b &lt, 4\lambda$ and that the labels are independent given the set if and only if $a = b = 2\lambda$. We also show that the threshold for the level-set percolation in the 2D continuum GFF is $-2\lambda$. <br />Finally, we discuss the coupling of the labelled CLE$_4$ with the GFF. We characterise this coupling as a specific local set coupling, and show how to approximate these local sets. We further see how in these approximations the labels naturally encode distances to the boundary.;math.PR
1801.03830;Convergence Analysis of Sample Average Approximation of Two-stage Stochastic Generalized Equations;A solution of two-stage stochastic generalized equations is a pair: a first stage solution which is independent of realization of the random data and a second stage solution which is a function of random variables.This paper studies convergence of the sample average approximation of two-stage stochastic nonlinear generalized equations. In particular an exponential rate of the convergence is shown by using the perturbed partial linearization of functions. Moreover, sufficient conditions for the existence, uniqueness, continuity and regularity of solutions of two-stage stochastic generalized equations are presented under an assumption of monotonicity of the involved functions. These theoretical results are given without assuming relatively complete recourse, and are illustrated by two-stage stochastic non-cooperative games of two players.;math.OC
1801.03831;Strange attractors and non wandering domains near a homoclinic cycle to a bifocus;In this paper, we explore the three-dimensional chaotic set near a homoclinic cycle to a hyperbolic bifocus at which the vector field has negative divergence. If the invariant manifolds of the bifocus satisfy a non-degeneracy condition, a sequence of hyperbolic suspended horseshoes arises near the cycle, with one expanding and two contracting directions. We extend previous results on the field and we show that the first return map to a given cross section may be approximated by a map exhibiting heteroclinic tangencies associated to two periodic orbits. When the cycle is broken, under an additional hypothesis about the coexistence of two heteroclinically related periodic points (one without dominated splitting into one-dimensional sub-bundles), the heteroclinic tangencies can be slightly modified in order to satisfy Tatjer's conditions for a generalized tangency of codimension two. This configuration may be seen as the organizing center, by which one can obtain Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations and therefore, strange attractors, infinitely many sinks and non-trivial contracting wandering domains.;math.DS
1801.03839;Cohen class of time-frequency representations and operators: boundedness and uncertainty principles;This paper presents a proof of an uncertainty principle of Donoho-Stark type involving $\varepsilon$-concentration of localization operators. More general operators associated with time-frequency representations in the Cohen class are then considered. For these operators, which include all usual quantizations, we prove a boundedness result in the $L^p$ functional setting and a form of uncertainty principle analogous to that for localization operators.;math.FA
1801.03847;A geometric statement of the Harnack inequality for a degenerate Kolmogorov equation with rough coefficients;We consider weak solutions of degenerate second order partial differential equations of Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck type with measurable coefficients in divergence form. We give a geometric statement of the Harnack inequality recently proven by Golse, Imbert, Mouhot and Vasseur. As a corollary we obtain a strong maximum principle.;math.AP
1801.03852;Computing the density of states for optical spectra by low-rank and QTT tensor approximation;In this paper, we introduce a new interpolation scheme to approximate the density of states (DOS) for a class of rank-structured matrices with application to the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). The presented approach for approximating the DOS is based on two main techniques. First, we propose an economical method for calculating the traces of parametric matrix resolvents at interpolation points by taking advantage of the block-diagonal plus low-rank matrix structure described in [6, 3] for the BSE/TDA problem. Second, we show that a regularized or smoothed DOS discretized on a fine grid of size $N$ can be accurately represented by a low rank quantized tensor train (QTT) tensor that can be determined through a least squares fitting procedure. The latter provides good approximation properties for strictly oscillating DOS functions with multiple gaps, and requires asymptotically much fewer ($O(\log N)$) functional calls compared with the full grid size $N$. This approach allows us to overcome the computational difficulties of the traditional schemes by avoiding both the need of stochastic sampling and interpolation by problem independent functions like polynomials etc. Numerical tests indicate that the QTT approach yields accurate recovery of DOS associated with problems that contain relatively large spectral gaps. The QTT tensor rank only weakly depends on the size of a molecular system which paves the way for treating large-scale spectral problems.;math.NA
1801.03854;Analysis of a Boundary-Domain Integral Equation System for the Mixed Interior Diffusion BVP with Variable Coefficient Based on a New Family of Parametrices;A mixed boundary value problem for the diffusion equation in non-homogeneous media partial differential equation is reduced to a system of direct segregated parametrix-based Boundary-Domain Integral Equations (BDIEs). We use a parametrix different from the one employed by Chkadua, Mikhailov and Natroshvili in the paper 'Analysis of direct boundary-domain integral equations for a mixed BVP with variable coefficient, I: Equivalence and invertibility'. Mapping properties of boundedness and compactness of parametrix-based surface and volume potentials are analysed in appropriate Sobolev spaces. Using these properties we prove the equivalence between the original BVP and the corresponding BDIE system. Furthermore, we prove uniqueness of solution of the BDIE system by applying the Fredholm Alternative.;math.AP

1801.03860;Symmetric road interchanges;A road interchange where $n$ roads meet and in which the drivers are not allowed to change lanes can be modelled as an embedding of a 2-coloured (hence bipartite) multigraph $G$ with equal-sized colour classes into an orientable surface such that there is a face bounded by a Hamiltonian cycle (Kurauskas, 2017). The case of $G$ a complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ corresponds to a complete $n$-way interchange where drivers approaching from each of $n$ directions can exit to any other direction. The genus of the underlying surface can be interpreted as the number of bridges in the interchange. <br />In this paper we study the minimum genus, or the minimum number of bridges, of a complete interchange with a restriction that it is symmetric under the cyclic permutation of its roads. We consider both (a) abstract combinatorial/topological symmetry, and (b) symmetry in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$. The proof of (a) is based on the classic voltage and transition graph constructions. For (b) we use, among other techniques, a simple new combinatorial lower bound.;math.CO
1801.03861;Construction and Performance of Quantum Burst Error Correction Codes for Correlated Errors;In practical communication and computation systems, errors occur predominantly in adjacent positions rather than in a random manner. In this paper, we develop a stabilizer formalism for quantum burst error correction codes (QBECC) to combat such error patterns in the quantum regime. Our contributions are as follows. Firstly, we derive an upper bound for the correctable burst errors of QBECCs, the quantum Reiger bound (QRB). This bound generalizes the quantum Singleton bound for standard quantum error correction codes (QECCs). Secondly, we propose two constructions of QBECCs: one by heuristic computer search and the other by concatenating two quantum tensor product codes (QTPCs). We obtain several new QBECCs with better parameters than existing codes with the same coding length. Moreover, some of the constructed codes can saturate the quantum Reiger bounds. Finally, we perform numerical experiments for our constructed codes over Markovian correlated depolarizing quantum memory channels, and show that QBECCs indeed outperform standard QECCs in this scenario.;cs.IT
1801.03865;A Monetary Mechanism for Stabilizing Cooperative Data Exchange with Selfish Users;This paper considers the problem of stabilizing cooperative data exchange with selfish users. In this setting, each user has a subset of packets in the ground set $X$, and wants all other packets in $X$. The users can exchange their packets by broadcasting coded or uncoded packets over a lossless broadcast channel, and monetary transactions are allowed between any pair of users. We define the utility of each user as the sum of two sub-utility functions: (i) the difference between the total payment received by the user and the total transmission rate of the user, and (ii) the difference between the total number of required packets by the user and the total payment made by the user. A rate-vector and payment-matrix pair $(r,p)$ is said to stabilize the grand coalition (i.e., the set of all users) if $(r,p)$ is Pareto optimal over all minor coalitions (i.e., all proper subsets of users who collectively know all packets in $X$). Our goal is to design a stabilizing rate-payment pair with minimum total sum-rate and minimum total sum-payment for any given instance of the problem. In this work, we propose two algorithms that find such a solution. Moreover, we show that both algorithms maximize the sum of utility of all users (over all solutions), and one of the algorithms also maximizes the minimum utility among all users (over all solutions).;cs.IT
1801.03867;Hopf algebras on decorated noncrossing arc diagrams;Noncrossing arc diagrams are combinatorial models for the equivalence classes of the lattice congruences of the weak order on permutations. In this paper, we provide a general method to endow these objects with Hopf algebra structures. Specific instances of this method produce relevant Hopf algebras that appeared earlier in the literature.;math.CO
1801.03868;An entropy inequality for symmetric random variables;We establish a lower bound on the entropy of weighted sums of (possibly dependent) random variables $(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n)$ possessing a symmetric joint distribution. Our lower bound is in terms of the joint entropy of $(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n)$. We show that for $n \geq 3$, the lower bound is tight if and only if $X_i$'s are i.i.d.\ Gaussian random variables. For $n=2$ there are numerous other cases of equality apart from i.i.d.\ Gaussians, which we completely characterize. Going beyond sums, we also present an inequality for certain linear transformations of $(X_1, \dots, X_n)$. Our primary technical contribution lies in the analysis of the equality cases, and our approach relies on the geometry and the symmetry of the problem.;cs.IT

1801.03873;Characterisation of honest times and optional semimartingales of class-($&#x3a3,$);Given a finite honest time, we first derive a representation of the additive (the multiplicative) decomposition of its Az\'ema optional supermartingale in terms of the draw-down (the relative draw-down) of some optional supermartingales with continuous running supremum. The multiplicative representation then allows us to give a characterisation of finite honest times using a family of non-negative optional supermartingales with continuous running supremum which converges to zero at infinity. Finally, we extend the notion of semimartingales of class-$(\Sigma)$ to optional semimartingales with jumps in its finite variation part, allowing one to establish formulae similar to the Madan-Roynette-Yor option pricing formula for larger class of processes.;math.PR
1801.03877;Paths to Understanding Birational Rowmotion on Products of Two Chains;Birational rowmotion is an action on the space of assignments of rational functions to the elements of a finite partially-ordered set (poset). It is lifted from the well-studied rowmotion map on order ideals (equivariantly on antichains) of a poset $P$, which when iterated on special posets, has unexpectedly nice properties in terms of periodicity, cyclic sieving, and homomesy (statistics whose averages over each orbit are constant) [AST11, BW74, CF95, Pan09, PR13, RuSh12,RuWa15+,SW12, ThWi17, Yil17. In this context, rowmotion appears to be related to Auslander-Reiten translation on certain quivers, and birational rowmotion to $Y$-systems of type $A_m \times A_n$ described in Zamolodchikov periodicity. <br />We give a formula in terms of families of non-intersecting lattice paths for iterated actions of the birational rowmotion map on a product of two chains. This allows us to give a much simpler direct proof of the key fact that the period of this map on a product of chains of lengths $r$ and $s$ is $r+s+2$ (first proved by D.~Grinberg and the second author), as well as the first proof of the birational analogue of homomesy along files for such posets.;math.CO
1801.03881;Relative functoriality and functional equations via trace formulas;Langlands' functoriality principle predicts deep relations between the local and automorphic spectra of different reductive groups. This has been generalized by the relative Langlands program to include spherical varieties, among which reductive groups are special cases. In the philosophy of Langlands' "beyond endoscopy" program, these relations should be expressed as comparisons between different trace formulas, with the insertion of appropriate $L$-functions. The insertion of $L$-functions calls for one more goal to be achieved: the study of their functional equations via trace formulas. <br />The goal of this article is to demonstrate this program through examples, indicating a local-to-global approach as in the project of endoscopy. Here, scalar transfer factors are replaced by "transfer operators" or "Hankel transforms" which are nice enough (typically, expressible in terms of usual Fourier transforms) that they can be used, in principle, to prove global comparisons (in the form of Poisson summation formulas). Some of these examples have already appeared in the literature, for others, the proofs will appear elsewhere.;math.NT
1801.03885;Zeroth-order general Randic index of $k$-generalized quasi trees;For a simple graph $G(V,E)$, the zeroth-order general Randi\' c index is defined as $^0R_{\alpha}(G)=\sum_{v\in V(G)}d(v)^{\alpha}$, where $d(v)$ is the degree of the vertex $v$ and $\alpha\ne0$ is a real number. The $k$-generalized quasi-tree is a connected graph $G$ with a subset $V_k\subset V(G)$, where $|V_k|=k$ such that $G-V_k$ is a tree, but for any subset $V_{k-1}\subset V(G)$ with cardinality $k-1$, $G-V_{k-1}$ is not a tree. In this paper, we characterize the extremal $k$-generalized quasi trees with the minimum and maximum values of the zeroth-order general Randi\' c index for $\alpha\neq 0$.;math.CO
1801.03887;Words have bounded width in $SL(n,\mathbb{Z})$;We prove two results about width of words in $SL_n(\mathbb{Z})$. The first is that, for every $n \geq 3$, there is a constant $C(n)$ such that the width of any word in $SL_n(\mathbb{Z})$ is less than $C(n)$. The second result is that, for any word $w$, if $n$ is big enough, the width of $w$ in $SL_n(\mathbb{Z})$ is at most 87.;math.GR
1801.03892;Privacy in Index Coding: Improved Bounds and Coding Schemes;It was recently observed in [1], that in index coding, learning the coding matrix used by the server can pose privacy concerns: curious clients can extract information about the requests and side information of other clients. One approach to mitigate such concerns is the use of $k$-limited-access schemes [1], that restrict each client to learn only part of the index coding matrix, and in particular, at most $k$ rows. These schemes transform a linear index coding matrix of rank $T$ to an alternate one, such that each client needs to learn at most $k$ of the coding matrix rows to decode its requested message. This paper analyzes $k$-limited-access schemes. First, a worst-case scenario, where the total number of clients $n$ is $2^T-1$ is studied. For this case, a novel construction of the coding matrix is provided and shown to be order-optimal in the number of transmissions. Then, the case of a general $n$ is considered and two different schemes are designed and analytically and numerically assessed in their performance. It is shown that these schemes perform better than the one designed for the case $n=2^T-1$.;cs.IT
1801.03894;Stability in the homology of Deligne-Mumford compactifications;Using the the theory of FS^op modules, we study the asymptotic behavior of the homology of $\overline M_{g,n}$, the Deligne--Mumford compactification of the moduli space of curves, for $n &gt,&gt, 0$. An FS^op module is a contravariant functor from the category of finite sets and surjections to vector spaces. Via maps that glue on marked P^1's, we give the homology of $\overline M_{g,n}$ the structure of an FS^op module and bound its degree of generation. As a consequence, we prove that the generating function $\sum_{n} \dim(H_i(\overline M_{g,n})) t^n$ is rational, and its denominator has roots in the set $\{1, 1/2, \dots, 1/p(g,i)\}$ where $p(g,i)$ is a polynomial of order $O(g^2 i^2)$. We also obtain restrictions on the decomposition of the homology of $\overline M_{g,n}$ into irreducible $S_n$ representations.;math.AG
1801.03895;On Locally Decodable Index Codes;Index coding achieves bandwidth savings by jointly encoding the messages demanded by all the clients in a broadcast channel. The encoding is performed in such a way that each client can retrieve its demanded message from its side information and the broadcast codeword. In general, in order to decode its demanded message symbol, a receiver may have to observe the entire transmitted codeword. Querying or downloading the codeword symbols might involve costs to a client -- such as network utilization costs and storage requirements for the queried symbols to perform decoding. In traditional index coding solutions, this 'client aware' perspective is not considered during code design. As a result, for these codes, the number of codeword symbols queried by a client per decoded message symbol, which we refer to as 'locality', could be large. In this paper, considering locality as a cost parameter, we view index coding as a trade-off between the achievable broadcast rate (codeword length normalized by the message length) and locality, where the objective is to minimize the broadcast rate for a given value of locality and vice versa. We show that the smallest possible locality for any index coding problem is 1, and that the optimal index coding solution with locality 1 is the coding scheme based on fractional coloring of the interference graph. We propose index coding schemes with small locality by covering the side information graph using acyclic subgraphs and subgraphs with small minrank. We also show how locality can be accounted for in conventional partition multicast and cycle covering solutions to index coding. Finally, applying these new techniques, we characterize the locality-broadcast rate trade-off of the index coding problem whose side information graph is the directed 3-cycle.;cs.IT
1801.03908;Homogeneous length functions on groups;A pseudo-length function defined on an arbitrary group $G = (G,\cdot,e, (\,)^{-1})$ is a map $\ell: G \to [0,+\infty)$ obeying $\ell(e)=0$, the symmetry property $\ell(x^{-1}) = \ell(x)$, and the triangle inequality $\ell(xy) \leqslant \ell(x) + \ell(y)$ for all $x,y \in G$. We consider pseudo-length functions which saturate the triangle inequality whenever $x=y$, or equivalently those that are homogeneous in the sense that $\ell(x^n) = n\,\ell(x)$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. We show that this implies that $\ell([x,y])=0$ for all $x,y \in G$. This leads to a classification of such pseudo-length functions as pullbacks from embeddings into a Banach space. We also obtain a quantitative version of our main result which allows for defects in the triangle inequality or the homogeneity property.;math.GR

We give a self-contained treatment of Fock and Goncharov's description of the moduli space of framed marked properly convex projective structures with minimal or maximal ends, and deduce results of Marquis and Goldman as consequences. We also discuss the Poisson structure on moduli space and its relationship to Goldman's Poisson structure on the character variety.;math.GT
1801.03914;$L^1$ semigroup generation for Fokker-Planck operators associated with general L&#xe9,vy driven SDEs;We prove a new generation result in $L^1$ for a large class of non-local operators with non-degenerate local terms. This class contains the operators appearing in Fokker-Planck or Kolmogorov forward equations associated with L\'evy driven SDEs, i.e. the adjoint operators of the infinitesimal generators of these SDEs. As a byproduct, we also obtain a new elliptic regularity result of independent interest. The main novelty in this paper is that we can consider very general L\'evy operators, including state-space depending coefficients with linear growth and general L\'evy measures which can be singular and have fat tails.;math.DS
1801.03920;Inner Bound for the Capacity Region of Noisy Channels with an Authentication Requirement;The rate regions of many variations of the standard and wire-tap channels have been thoroughly explored. Secrecy capacity characterizes the loss of rate required to ensure that the adversary gains no information about the transmissions. Authentication does not have a standard metric, despite being an important counterpart to secrecy. While some results have taken an information-theoretic approach to the problem of authentication coding, the full rate region and accompanying trade-offs have yet to be characterized. In this paper, we provide an inner bound of achievable rates with an average authentication and reliability constraint. The bound is established by combining and analyzing two existing authentication schemes for both noisy and noiseless channels. We find that our coding scheme improves upon existing schemes.;cs.IT
1801.03925;A Note on a Fourier Expansion of Automorphic Functions that Nontrivially Involves the Euclidean Algorithm;We extend the Fourier expansion of automorphic functions of Piateski-Shapiro and Shalika in a way that the Euclidean algorithm appears nontrivially. Then, we discuss a potential application in the Rankin-Selberg method.;math.NT
1801.03930;A substructuring preconditioner with vertex-related interface solvers for elliptic-type equations in three dimensions;In this paper we propose a variant of the substructuring preconditioner for solving three-dimensional elliptic-type equations with strongly discontinuous coefficients. In the proposed preconditioner, we use the simplest coarse solver associated with the finite element space induced by the coarse partition, and construct vertex-related inexact interface solvers based on overlapping domain decomposition with small overlaps. This new preconditioner has an important merit: its construction and efficiency do not depend on the concrete form of the considered elliptic-type equations. % in the sense that they not only are cheap but also are easy to implement. We apply the proposed preconditioner to solve the linear elasticity problems and Maxwell's equations in three dimensions. Numerical results show that the convergence rate of PCG method with the preconditioner is nearly optimal, and also robust with respect to the (possibly large) jumps of the coefficients in the considered equations.;math.NA
1801.03931;New Results on Multilevel Diversity Coding with Secure Regeneration;The problem of multilevel diversity coding with secure regeneration is revisited. Under the assumption that the eavesdropper can access the repair data for all compromised storage nodes, Shao el al. provided a precise characterization of the minimum-bandwidth-regeneration (MBR) point of the achievable normalized storage-capacity repair-bandwidth tradeoff region. In this paper, it is shown that the MBR point of the achievable normalized storage-capacity repair-bandwidth tradeoff region remains the same even if we assume that the eavesdropper can access the repair data for some compromised storage nodes (type 2 compromised nodes) but only the data contents of the remaining compromised nodes (type 1 compromised nodes), as long as the number of type 1 compromised nodes is no greater than that of type 2 compromised nodes.;cs.IT
1801.03932;Extremals for the Singular Moser-Trudinger Inequality via n-Harmonic Transplantation;The Moser-Trudinger embedding has been generalized in [Adimurthi A., Sandeep K., A singular Moser-Trudinger embedding and its applications, \textit{NoDEA Nonlinear Differential Equations Appl.}, 13 (2007), no. 5-6, 585--603] to the following weighted version: if $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is bounded, $\omega_{n-1}$ is the $\mathcal{H}^{n-1}$ measure of the unit sphere, then for $\alpha&gt,0$ and $\beta\in [0,n)$, $$ <br />\sup_{u\in\mathcal{B}_1}\int_{\Omega}\frac{e^{\alpha |u|^{n/(n-1)}}}{|x|^{\beta}}\leq C \ \Leftrightarrow \ \frac{\alpha}{\alpha_n}+\frac{\beta}{n}\leq1,\qquad $$ where $\alpha_n=n\cnn$ and $\mathcal{B}_1 = \left\{ u \in W_0^{1, n}(\Omega) \ | \ \int_{\Omega} |\nabla u |^n \leq1 \right\}$. We prove that the supremum is attained on any domain $\Omega$. The paper also fills in the gaps in the proof of [Lin K.C., Extremal functions for Moser's inequality, \textit{Trans. of. Am. Math. Soc.}, 384 (1996), 2663--2671], which deals with the case $\beta=0.$;math.AP
1801.03951;LDPC Codes with Local and Global Decoding;This paper presents a theoretical study of a new type of LDPC codes motivated by practical storage applications. LDPCL codes (suffix L represents locality) are LDPC codes that can be decoded either as usual over the full code block, or locally when a smaller sub-block is accessed (to reduce latency). LDPCL codes are designed to maximize the error-correction performance vs. rate in the usual (global) mode, while at the same time providing a certain performance in the local mode. We develop a theoretical framework for the design of LDPCL codes. Our results include a design tool to construct an LDPC code with two data-protection levels: local and global. We derive theoretical results supporting this tool and we show how to achieve capacity with it. A trade-off between the gap to capacity and the number of full-block accesses is studied, and a finite-length analysis of ML decoding is performed to exemplify a trade-off between the locality capability and the full-block error-correcting capability.;cs.IT
1801.03958;Sheaves on the alcoves and modular representations II;We relate the category of sheaves on alcoves that was constructed in "Sheaves on the alcoves and modular representations I" to the representation theory of reductive algebraic groups. In particular, we show that its indecomposable projective objects encode the simple rational characters of a reductive algebraic group in all characteristics above the Coxeter number.;math.RT
1801.03959;Sheaves on the alcoves and modular representations I;We consider the set of affine alcoves associated with a root system R as a topological space and consider a certain category S of sheaves of Z-modules on this space. Here Z is the structure algebra of the root system over a field k. To any wall reflection we associate a wall crossing functor on S. In the companion article "Sheaves on the alcoves and modular representations II" we prove that S encodes the simple rational characters of the connected, simply connected algebraic group with root system R over k, in the case that k is algebraically closed with characteristic above the Coxeter number.;math.RT
1801.03961;Harnack inequality for a class of Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck equations in non-divergence form;We prove invariant Harnack inequalities for certain classes of non-divergence form equations of Kolmogorov type. The operators we consider exhibit invariance properties with respect to a homogeneous Lie group structure. The coefficient matrix is assumed either to satisfy a Cordes-Landis condition on the eigenvalues, or to admit a uniform modulus of continuity.;math.AP
1801.03964;Resolvability on Continuous Alphabets;We characterize the resolvability region for a large class of point-to-point channels with continuous alphabets. In our direct result, we prove not only the existence of good resolvability codebooks, but adapt an approach based on the Chernoff-Hoeffding bound to the continuous case showing that the probability of drawing an unsuitable codebook is doubly exponentially small. For the converse part, we show that our previous elementary result carries over to the continuous case easily under some mild continuity assumption.;cs.IT
1801.03969;Discrete Hodge star operator on 3-manifolds;Scott Wilson introduced the notion of combinatorial Hodge star operators on a compact oriented triangulated manifold $M$, which act on the singular cohomology ring of $M$. Such an operator depends on both a triangulation $\mathscr K$ of $M$ and a metric on the simplicial cochain complex of $\mathscr K$. Taking the discrete metric, we arrive at the notion of the discrete Hodge star operator for each pair $(M,\mathscr K)$. We prove, when $M$ is a $3$-manifold, that the discrete Hodge star operators acting on the cuspidal cohomology groups $H^i_\mathrm{cusp}(M,\mathbb Q)$ are independent of $\mathscr K$ for $i=1,2$. As an application, we construct a canonical positive definite symmetric quadratic form on $H^i_\mathrm{cusp}(M,\mathbb Q)$ for $i=1,2$. On the other hand, we will interpret our result from a point of view on the Langlands Program, we provide a supporting evidence for the conjecture of Prasanna and Venkatesh, which predicts a degree-shifting action of a motivic cohomology group on the cohomology ring of an arithmetic group.;math.AT
1801.03972;Extremal $G$-free induced subgraphs of Kneser graphs;The Kneser graph ${\rm KG}_{n,k}$ is a graph whose vertex set is the family of all $k$-subsets of $[n]$ and two vertices are adjacent if their corresponding subsets are disjoint. The classical Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem determines the cardinality and structure of a maximum induced $K_2$-free subgraph in ${\rm KG}_{n,k}$. As a generalization of the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem, Erd\H{o}s proposed a conjecture about the maximum order of an induced $K_{s+1}$-free subgraph of ${\rm KG}_{n,k}$. As the best known result concerning this conjecture, Frankl [Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A, 2013], when $n\geq(2s+1)k-s$, gave an affirmative answer to this conjecture and also determined the structure of such a subgraph. In this paper, generalizing the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem and the Erd{\H o}s matching conjecture, we consider the problem of determining the structure of a maximum family $\mathcal{A}$ for which ${\rm KG}_{n,k}[\mathcal{A}]$ has no subgraph isomorphic to a given graph $G$. In this regard, we determine the size and the structure of such a family provided that $n$ is sufficiently large with respect to $G$ and $k$. Furthermore, for the case $G=K_{1,t}$, we present a Hilton-Milner type theorem regarding above-mentioned problem, which specializes to an improvement of a result by Gerbner et al. [SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, 2012].;math.CO
1801.03975;Timely Status Update in Massive IoT Systems: Decentralized Scheduling for Wireless Uplinks;In a typical Internet of Things (IoT) application where a central controller collects status updates from multiple terminals, e.g., sensors and monitors, through a wireless multiaccess uplink, an important problem is how to attain timely status updates autonomously. In this paper, the timeliness of the status is measured by the recently proposed age-of-information (AoI) metric, both the theoretical and practical aspects of the problem are investigated: we aim to obtain a scheduling policy with minimum AoI and, meanwhile, still suitable for decentralized implementation on account of signalling exchange overhead. Towards this end, we first consider the set of arrival-independent and renewal (AIR) policies, the optimal policy thereof to minimize the time-average AoI is proved to be a round-robin policy with one-packet (latest packet only and others are dropped) buffers (RR-ONE). The optimality is established based on a generalized Poisson-arrival-see-time-average (PASTA) theorem. It is further proved that RR-ONE is asymptotically optimal among all policies in the massive IoT regime. The AoI steady-state stationary distribution under RR-ONE is also derived. A fully decentralized implementation of RR-ONE is proposed which can accommodate dynamic terminal appearances. In addition, considering scenarios where packets cannot be dropped, the optimal AIR policy thereof is also found with parameters given by the solution to a convex problem.;cs.IT
1801.03982;Zeta-regularization and the heat-trace on some compact quantum semigroups;Heat-invariants are a class of spectral invariants of Laplace-type operators on compact Riemannian manifolds that contain information about the geometry of the manifold, e.g., the metric and connection. Since Brownian motion solves the heat equation, these invariants can be obtained studying Brownian motion on manifolds. In this article, we consider Brownian motion on the Toeplitz algebra, discrete Heisenberg group algebras, and non-commutative tori to define Laplace-type operators and heat-semigroups on these C*-bialgebras. We show that their traces can be $\zeta$-regularized and compute "heat-traces" on these algebras, giving us a notion of dimension and volume. Furthermore, we consider $SU_q(2)$ which does not have a Brownian motion but a class of driftless Gaussians which still recover the dimension of $SU_q(2)$.;math.OA
1801.03985;On the roots of Wiener polynomials of graphs;The Wiener polynomial of a connected graph $G$ is defined as $W(G,x)=\sum x^{d(u,v)}$, where $d(u,v)$ denotes the distance between $u$ and $v$, and the sum is taken over all unordered pairs of distinct vertices of $G$. We examine the nature and location of the roots of Wiener polynomials of graphs, and in particular trees. We show that while the maximum modulus among all roots of Wiener polynomials of graphs of order $n$ is $\binom{n}{2}-1$, the maximum modulus among all roots of Wiener polynomials of trees of order $n$ grows linearly in $n$. We prove that the closure of the collection of real roots of Wiener polynomials of all graphs is precisely $(-\infty, 0]$, while in the case of trees, it contains $(-\infty, -1]$. Finally, we demonstrate that the imaginary parts and (positive) real parts of roots of Wiener polynomials can be arbitrarily large.;math.CO
1801.03987;Asymptotics for the Ginzburg-Landau equation on manifolds with boundary under homogeneous Neumann condition;On a compact manifold $M^{n}$ ($n\geq 3$) with boundary, we study the asymptotic behavior as $\epsilon$ tends to zero of solutions $u_{\epsilon}: M \to \mathbb{C}$ to the equation $\Delta u_{\epsilon} + \epsilon^{-2}(1 - |u_{\epsilon}|^{2})u_{\epsilon} = 0$ with the boundary condition $\partial_{\nu}u_{\epsilon} = 0$ on $\partial M$. Assuming an energy upper bound on the solutions and a convexity condition on $\partial M$, we show that along a subsequence, the energy of $\{u_{\epsilon}\}$ breaks into two parts: one captured by a harmonic $1$-form $\psi$ on $M$, and the other concentrating on the support of a rectifiable $(n-2)$-varifold $V$ which is stationary with respect to deformations preserving $\partial M$. Examples are given which shows that $V$ could vanish altogether, or be non-zero but supported only on $\partial M$.;math.AP

Voiculescu proved that every separable unital sub-C*-algebra of the Calkin algebra is equal to its (relative) bicommutant. In his minicourse (see reference), G. Pedersen asked in 1988 if Voiculescu's theorem can be extended to a simple corona algebra of a $\sigma$-unital C*-algebra. In this note, we answer Pedersen's question for a stable $\sigma$-unital C*-algebra.;math.OA

1801.04001;Efficient C-RAN Random Access for IoT Devices: Learning Links via Recommendation Systems;We focus on C-RAN random access protocols for IoT devices that yield low-latency high-rate active-device detection in dense networks of large-array remote radio heads. In this context, we study the problem of learning the strengths of links between detected devices and network sites. In particular, we develop recommendation-system inspired algorithms, which exploit random-access observations collected across the network to classify links between active devices and network sites across the network. Our simulations and analysis reveal the potential merit of data-driven schemes for such on-the-fly link classification and subsequent resource allocation across a wide-area network.;cs.IT

1801.04003;Some techniques in density estimation;Density estimation is an interdisciplinary topic at the intersection of statistics, theoretical computer science and machine learning. We review some old and new techniques for bounding the sample complexity of estimating densities of continuous distributions, focusing on the class of mixtures of Gaussians and its subclasses. In particular, we review the main techniques used to prove the new sample complexity bounds for mixtures of Gaussians by Ashtiani, Ben-David, Harvey, Liaw, Mehrabian, and Plan <a href="/abs/1710.05209">arXiv:1710.05209</a>.;math.ST
1801.04005;Minimax Optimality of Sign Test for Paired Heterogeneous Data;Comparing two groups under different conditions is ubiquitous in the biomedical sciences. In many cases, samples from the two groups can be naturally paired, for example a pair of samples may come from the same individual under the two conditions. However samples across different individuals may be highly heterogeneous. Traditional methods often ignore such heterogeneity by assuming the samples are identically distributed. In this work, we study the problem of comparing paired heterogeneous data by modeling the data as Gaussian distributed with different parameters across the samples. We show that in the minimax setting where we want to maximize the worst-case power, the sign test, which only uses the signs of the differences between the paired sample, is optimal in the one-sided case and near optimal in the two-sided case. The superiority of the sign test over other popular tests for paired heterogeneous data is demonstrated using both synthetic data and a real-world RNA-Seq dataset.;math.ST
1801.04009;$C^1$ actions on manifolds by lattices in Lie groups;In this paper we study Zimmer's conjecture for $C^1$ actions of lattice subgroup of a higher-rank simple Lie group with finite center on compact manifolds. We show that when the rank of the lattice is larger than the dimension of the manifold, then the action factors through a finite group. In particular, we prove Zimmer's conjecture for $C^1$ actions of lattices in $SL(n, \R)$.;math.DS
1801.04010;Adaptive Bit Allocation for OFDM Cognitive Radio Systems with Imperfect Channel Estimation;Cognitive radios hold tremendous promise for increasing the spectral efficiency of wireless communication systems. In this paper, an adaptive bit allocation algorithm is presented for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) CR systems operating in a frequency selective fading environment. The algorithm maximizes the CR system throughput in the presence of narrowband interference, while guaranteeing a BER below a predefined threshold. The effect of imperfect channel estimation on the algorithm's performance is also studied.;cs.IT
1801.04020;An explicit correspondence of modular curves;In this paper, we recall an alternative proof of Merel's conjecture which asserts that a certain explicit correspondence gives the isogeny relation between the Jacobians associated to the normalizer of split and non-split Cartan subgroups. This alternative proof does not require extensive representation theory and can be formulated in terms of certain finite geometries modulo $\ell$. <br />Secondly, we generalize these arguments to exhibit an explicit correspondence which gives the isogeny relation between the Jacobians associated to split and non-split Cartan subgroups. An interesting feature is that the required explicit correspondence is considerably more complicated but can expressed as a certain linear combination of double coset operators whose coefficients we are able to make explicit.;math.NT
1801.04021;Analyticity of Resonances and Eigenvalues and Spectral Properties of the massless Spin-Boson Model;We extend the method of multiscale analysis for resonances introduced in [5] in order to infer analytic properties of resonances and eigenvalues (and their eigenprojections) as well as estimates for the localization of the spectrum of dilated Hamiltonians and norm-bounds for the corresponding resolvent operators, in neighborhoods of resonances and eigenvalues. We apply our method to the massless Spin-Boson model assuming a slight infrared regularization. We prove that the resonance and the ground-state eigenvalue (and their eigenprojections) are analytic with respect to the dilation parameter and the coupling constant. Moreover, we prove that the spectrum of the dilated Spin-Boson Hamiltonian in the neighborhood of the resonance and the ground-state eigenvalue is localized in two cones in the complex plane with vertices at the location of the resonance and the ground-state eigenvalue, respectively. Additionally, we provide norm-estimates for the resolvent of the dilated Spin-Boson Hamiltonian near the resonance and the ground-state eigenvalue. The topic of analyticity of eigenvalues and resonances has let to several studies and advances in the past. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that it is addressed from the perspective of multiscale analysis. Once the multiscale analysis is set up our method gives easy access to analyticity: Essentially, it amounts to proving it for isolated eigenvalues only and use that uniform limits of analytic functions are analytic. The type of spectral and resolvent estimates that we prove are needed to control the time evolution including the scattering regime. The latter will be demonstrated in a forthcoming publication. The introduced multiscale method to study spectral and resolvent estimates follows its own inductive scheme and is independent (and different) from the method we apply to construct resonances.;math-ph
1801.04022;Cognitive Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access with Cooperative Relaying: A New Wireless Frontier for 5G Spectrum Sharing;Two emerging technologies towards 5G wireless networks, namely non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and cognitive radio (CR), will provide more efficient utilization of wireless spectrum in the future. In this article, we investigate the integration of NOMA with CR into a holistic system, namely cognitive NOMA network, for more intelligent spectrum sharing. Design principles of cognitive NOMA networks are perfectly aligned to functionality requirements of 5G wireless networks, such as high spectrum efficiency, massive connectivity, low latency, and better fairness. Three different cognitive NOMA architectures are presented, including underlay NOMA networks, overlay NOMA networks, and CR-inspired NOMA networks. To address inter- and intra-network interference which largely degrade the performance of cognitive NOMA networks, cooperative relaying strategies are proposed. For each cognitive NOMA architecture, our proposed cooperative relaying strategy shows its potential to significantly lower outage probabilities. Furthermore, we discuss open challenges and future research directions on implementation of cognitive NOMA networks.;cs.IT
1801.04023;Relations in the cohomology ring of the moduli space of flat $SO(2n+1)$-connections on a Riemann surface;We consider the moduli space of flat $SO(2n+1)$-connections (up to gauge transformations) on a Riemann surface, with fixed holonomy around a marked point. There are natural line bundles over this moduli space, we construct geometric representatives for the Chern classes of these line bundles, and prove that the ring generated by these Chern classes vanishes below the dimension of the moduli space, generalising a conjecture of Newstead.;math.DG
1801.04024;Strong amenability and the infinite conjugacy class property;A group is said to be strongly amenable if each of its proximal topological actions has a fixed point.

More generally, a countable discrete group is strongly amenable if and only if none of its quotients have the infinite conjugacy class property.;math.GR
1801.04027;A New Continuum-Based Thick Shell Finite Element for Soft Biological Tissues in Dynamics: Part 2 - Anisotropic Hyperelasticity and Incompressibility Aspects;In a companion article (Part 1), we presented the development of a thick continuum-based (CB) shell finite element (FE) based on Mindlin-Reissner theory. We verified the accuracy, efficiency and locking insensitivity of the element in modeling large 3D deformations, using linear elastic material properties. In the present article, we developed and implemented the kinetics description, within the updated Lagrangian (UL) formulation, of anisotropic incompressible hyperelastic constitutive relations that enable the CB shell FE to accurately model very large 3D strains and deformations. Specifically, we developed the measures of deformation in the lamina coordinate system, presented three techniques to model nonlinear hyperelastic strains, and enabled the direct enforcement of incompressibility and of the zero normal stress condition without using a penalty factor or a Lagrange multiplier. Moving towards the application of the present work to the biomedical realm, we performed multiple experiments concerning mechanical behavior of rubber-like materials and soft biological tissues in different geometries and loading conditions. Excellent agreements between the present FE results and the analytical and/or experimental data proved the CB shell FE combined with the present constitutive techniques to be a highly reliable and efficient tool for modeling, analyzing, and predicting mechanical behavior of soft biological tissues.;math.NA
1801.04029;A New Continuum-Based Thick Shell Finite Element for Soft Biological Tissues in Dynamics: Part 1 - Preliminary Benchmarking Using Classic Verification Experiments;For the finite element simulation of thin soft biological tissues in dynamics, shell elements, compared to volume elements, can capture the whole tissue thickness at once, and feature larger critical time steps. However, the capabilities of existing shell elements to account for irregular geometries, and hyperelastic, anisotropic 3D deformations characteristic of soft tissues are still limited. As improvement, we developed a new general nonlinear thick continuum-based (CB) shell finite element (FE) based on the Mindlin-Reissner shell theory, with large bending, large distortion and large strain capabilities, embedded in the updated Lagrangian formulation and explicit time integration. We performed numerical benchmark experiments available from the literature that focus on engineering linear elastic materials, which, verified and proved the new thick CB shell FE to: 1) be accurate an efficient 2) be powerful in handling large 3D deformations, curved geometries, 3) accommodate coarse distorted meshes, and 4) achieve comparatively fast computational times. The new element was also insensitive to three types of locking (shear, membrane and volumetric), and warping effects. The capabilities of the present thick CB shell FE in the biomedical realm are illustrated in a companion article (Part 2), in which anisotropic incompressible hyperelastic constitutive relations are implemented and verified.;math.NA

As an analogue to the double slice genus, we also define the superslice genus of a knot, and give both an upper bound and a lower bound in the topological category.;math.GT

The existing coding scheme is simplified in two steps by replacing Wyner secrecy coding with Carleial-Hellman secrecy coding. The resulting simplified scheme is free from redundant message splits and random components. Not least, the simplified scheme retains the existing achievable individual secrecy rate region. Finally, its construction simplicity helps us gain additional insight on the integration of secrecy techniques into error-correcting coding schemes.;cs.IT
1801.04034;Hausdorff dimension of Kuperberg minimal sets;In 1994, Kuperberg constructed a smooth flow on a three-manifold with no periodic orbits.

We develop new techniques to study the symbolic dynamics and dimension theory of this minimal set, by relating it to the limit set of a graph directed pseudo-Markov system over a countable alphabet.;math.DS
1801.04037;Weakly singular corners always scatter;Assume that a bounded scatterer is embedded into an infinite homogeneous isotropic background medium in two dimensions. The refractive index function is supposed to be piecewise constant. If the scattering interface contains a weakly or strongly singular point, we prove that the scattered field cannot vanish identically. This particularly leads to the absence of non-scattering energies for piecewise analytic interfaces with a weakly singular point. Local uniqueness is obtained for shape identification problems in inverse medium scattering with a single far-field pattern.;math.AP
1801.04039;Sequential derivatives;Consider a real valued function defined, but not differentiable at some point. We use sequences approaching the point of interest to define and study sequential concepts of secant and cord derivatives of the function at the point of interest.

1801.04044;Wigner functions on non-standard symplectic vector spaces;We consider the Weyl quantization on a flat non-standard symplectic vector space. We focus mainly on the properties of the Wigner functions defined therein. In particular we show that the sets of Wigner functions on distinct symplectic spaces are different but have non-empty intersections. This extends previous results to arbitrary dimension and arbitrary (constant) symplectic structure. As a by-product we introduce and prove several concepts and results on non-standard symplectic spaces which generalize those on the standard symplectic space, namely the symplectic spectrum, Williamson's theorem and Narcowich-Wigner spectra. We also show how Wigner functions on non-standard symplectic spaces behave under the action of an arbitrary linear coordinate transformation.;math-ph
1801.04050;Communication Optimality Trade-offs For Distributed Estimation;This paper proposes $\mathbf{C}$ommunication efficient $\mathbf{RE}$cursive $\mathbf{D}$istributed estimati$\mathbf{O}$n algorithm, $\mathcal{CREDO}$, for networked multi-worker setups without a central master node. $\mathcal{CREDO}$ is designed for scenarios in which the worker nodes aim to collaboratively estimate a vector parameter of interest using distributed online time-series data at the individual worker nodes. The individual worker nodes iteratively update their estimate of the parameter by assimilating latest locally sensed information and estimates from neighboring worker nodes exchanged over a (possibly sparse) time-varying communication graph. The underlying inter-worker communication protocol is adaptive, making communications increasingly (probabilistically) sparse as time progresses. Under minimal conditions on the inter-worker information exchange network and the sensing models, almost sure convergence of the estimate sequences at the worker nodes to the true parameter is established. Further, the paper characterizes the performance of $\mathcal{CREDO}$ in terms of asymptotic covariance of the estimate sequences and specifically establishes the achievability of optimal asymptotic covariance. The analysis reveals an interesting interplay between the algorithm's communication cost~$\mathcal{C}_{t}$ (over $t$ time-steps) and the asymptotic covariance. Most notably, it is shown that $\mathcal{CREDO}$ may be designed to achieve a $\Theta\left(\mathcal{C}_{t}^{-2+\zeta}\right)$ decay of the mean square error~($\zeta&gt,0$, arbitrarily small) at each worker node, which significantly improves over the existing $ \Theta\left(\mathcal{C}_{t}^{-1}\right)$ rates. Simulation examples on both synthetic and real data sets demonstrate $\mathcal{CREDO}$'s communication efficiency.;math.OC
1801.04063;How Many Samples Required in Big Data Collection: A Differential Message Importance Measure;Information collection is a fundamental problem in big data, where the size of sampling sets plays a very important role. This work considers the information collection process by taking message importance into account. Similar to differential entropy, we define differential message importance measure (DMIM) as a measure of message importance for continuous random variable. It is proved that the change of DMIM can describe the gap between the distribution of a set of sample values and a theoretical distribution. In fact, the deviation of DMIM is equivalent to Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, but it offers a new way to characterize the distribution goodness-of-fit. Numerical results show some basic properties of DMIM and the accuracy of the proposed approximate values. Furthermore, it is also obtained that the empirical distribution approaches the real distribution with decreasing of the DMIM deviation, which contributes to the selection of suitable sampling points in actual system.;cs.IT
1801.04064;State Variation Mining: On Information Divergence with Message Importance in Big Data;Information transfer which reveals the state variation of variables usually plays a vital role in big data analytics and processing. In fact, the measures for information transfer could reflect the system change by use of the variable distributions, similar to KL divergence and Renyi divergence. Furthermore, in terms of the information transfer in big data, small probability events usually dominate the importance of the total message to some degree. Therefore, it is significant to design an information transfer measure based on the message importance which emphasizes the small probability events. In this paper, we propose a message importance transfer measure (MITM) and investigate its characteristics and applications on three aspects. First, the message importance transfer capacity based on MITM is presented to offer an upper bound for the information transfer process with disturbance. Then, we extend the MITM to the continuous case and discuss the robustness by using it to measuring information distance. Finally, we utilize the MITM to guide the queue length selection in the caching operation of mobile edge computing.;cs.IT
1801.04067;Content Based Status Updates;Consider a stream of status updates generated by a source, where each update is of one of two types: high priority or ordinary (low priority). These updates are to be transmitted through a network to a monitor. However, the transmission policy of each packet depends on the type of stream it belongs to. For the low priority stream, we analyze and compare the performances of two transmission schemes: (i) Ordinary updates are served in a First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) fashion, whereas, in (ii), the ordinary updates are transmitted according to an M/G/1/1 with preemption policy. In both schemes, high priority updates are transmitted according to an M/G/1/1 with preemption policy and receive preferential treatment. An arriving priority update discards and replaces any currently-in-service high priority update, and preempts (with eventual resume for scheme (i)) any ordinary update. We model the arrival processes of the two kinds of updates, in both schemes, as independent Poisson processes. For scheme (i), we find the arrival and service rates under which the system is stable and give closed-form expressions for average peak age and a lower bound on the average age of the ordinary stream. For scheme (ii), we derive closed-form expressions for the average age and average peak age of the high priority and low priority streams. We finally show that, if the service time is exponentially distributed, the M/M/1/1 with preemption policy leads to an average age of the low priority stream higher than the one achieved using the FCFS scheme. Therefore, the M/M//1/1 with preemption policy, when applied on the low priority stream of updates and in the presence of a higher priority scheme, is not anymore the optimal transmission policy from an age point of view.;cs.IT
1801.04068;Status Updates in a multi-stream M/G/1/1 preemptive queue;We consider a source that collects a multiplicity of streams of updates and sends them through a network to a monitor. However, only a single update can be in the system at a time. Therefore, the transmitter always preempts the packet being served when a new update is generated. We consider Poisson arrivals for each stream and a common general service time, and refer to this system as the multi-stream M/G/1/1 queue with preemption. Using the detour flow graph method, we compute a closed form expression for the average age and the average peak age of each stream. Moreover, we deduce that although all streams are treated equally from a transmission point of view (they all preempt each other), one can still prioritize a stream from an age point of view by simply increasing its generation rate. However, this will increase the sum of the ages which is minimized when all streams have the same update rate.;cs.IT
1801.04070;A Fast Algorithm with Error Bounds for Quadrature by Expansion;Quadrature by Expansion (QBX) is a quadrature method for approximating the value of the singular integrals encountered in the evaluation of layer potentials. It exploits the smoothness of the layer potential by forming locally-valid expansion which are then evaluated to compute the near or on-surface value of the integral. Recent work towards coupling of a Fast Multipole Method (FMM) to QBX yielded a first step towards the rapid evaluation of such integrals (and the solution of related integral equations), albeit with only empirically understood error behavior. In this paper, we improve upon this approach with a modified algorithm for which we give a comprehensive analysis of error and cost in the case of the Laplace equation in two dimensions. For the same levels of (user-specified) accuracy, the new algorithm empirically has cost-per-accuracy comparable to prior approaches. We provide experimental results to demonstrate scalability and numerical accuracy.;math.NA
1801.04072;Controller Synthesis for Safety of Physically-Viable Data-Driven Models;We consider the problem of designing finite-horizon safe controllers for a dynamical system for which no explicit analytical model exists and limited data only along a single trajectory of the system are available. Given samples of the states and inputs of the system, and additional side information in terms of regularity of the evolution of the states and conservation laws, we synthesize a controller such that the evolution of the states avoid some pre-specified unsafe set over a given finite horizon. Motivated by recent results on Whitney's extension theorem, we use piecewise-polynomial approximations of the trajectories based on the data along with the regularity side information to formulate a data-driven differential inclusion model that can predict the evolution of the trajectories. For these classes of data- driven differential inclusions, we propose a safety analysis theorem based on barrier certificates. As a corollary of this theorem, we demonstrate that we can design controllers ensuring safety of the solutions to the data-driven differential inclusion over a finite horizon. From a computational standpoint, our results are cast into a set of sum-of-squares programs whenever the certificates are parametrized by polynomials of fixed degree and the sets are semi-algebraic. This computational method allows incorporating side information in terms of conservation laws and integral constraints using Positivstellensatz-type arguments.;math.OC
1801.04075;Laplace, Residue, and Euler integral representations of GKZ hypergeometric functions;We consider four types of representations of solutions of GKZ system: series representations, Laplace integral representations, Euler integral representations, and Residue integral representations which will be introduced in this paper. In the former half of this paper, we provide a method for constructing integration cycles for Laplace, Residue, and Euler integral representations and relate them to series representations. In the latter half, we reformulate our integral representations in terms of direct images of $D$-modules and show their equivalence.;math.CA
1801.04077;Optimal control of an evolution equation with non-smooth dissipation;In the present work we study the optimal control of an evolution equation with non-smooth dissipation. The solution mapping of this system is non-smooth and hence the analysis is quite challenging. Our approach is to regularize the dissipation via approximation by a smooth function. We derive optimality conditions for the corresponding smooth optimal control problem. Then we drive the regularization parameter to zero and obtain necessary optimality conditions for the original non-smooth problem. However, in this process we lose regularity of the adjoint variables.;math.OC
1801.04079;On asymptotic stability of ground states of some systems of nonlinear Schr&#xf6,dinger equations;We extend to a specific class of systems of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (NLS) the theory of asymptotic stability of ground states already proved for the scalar NLS. Here the key point is the choice of an adequate system of modulation coordinates and the novelty, compared to the scalar NLS, is the fact that the group of symmetries of the system is non-commutative.;math.AP
1801.04086;Maximal and typical nonnegative ranks of nonnegative tensors;Let $N_1, \ldots, N_d$ be positive integers with $N_1\leq\cdots\leq N_d$. Set $N=N_1\cdots N_{d-1}$. We show in this paper that an integer $r$ is a typical nonnegative rank of nonnegative tensors of format $N_1\times\cdots\times N_d$ if and only if $r\leq N$ and $r$ is greater than or equals to the generic rank of tensors over $\mathbb{C}$ of format $N_1\times\cdots\times N_d$. We also show that the maximal nonnegative rank of nonnegative tensors of format $N_1\times\cdots\times N_d$ is $N$.;math.RA
1801.04088;Non self-adjoint laplacians on a directed graph;We consider a non self-adjoint Laplacian on a directed graph with non symmetric edge weights. We analyse spectral properties of this Laplacian under a Kirchhoff assumption. Moreover we establish isoperimet-ric inequalities in terms of the numerical range to show the absence of the essential spectrum of the Laplacian on heavy end directed graphs.;math.SP
1801.04090;On notions of Q-independence and Q-identical distributiveness;In a recent article A.M. Kagan and G.J.Sz\'ekely introduced a notion of Q-independent and Q-identical distributed random variables. We give a complete description of polynomials which appear in these definitions.;math.PR
1801.04091;Multivariate stochastic delay differential equations and CAR representations of CARMA processes;In this study we show how to represent a continuous time autoregressive moving average (CARMA) as a higher order stochastic delay differential equation, which may be thought of as a continuous-time equivalent of the AR($\infty$) representation. Furthermore, we show how this representation gives rise to a prediction formula for CARMA processes. To be used in the above mentioned results we develop a general theory for multivariate stochastic delay differential equations, which will be of independent interest, and which will have particular focus on existence, uniqueness and representations.;math.PR
1801.04094;Infinite Families of Equivariantly Formal Toric Orbifolds;The simplicial wedge construction on simplicial complexes and simple polytopes has been used by a variety of authors to study toric and related spaces, including non-singular toric varieties, toric manifolds, intersections of quadrics and more generally, polyhedral products. In this paper we extend the analysis to include toric orbifolds. Our main results yield infinite families of toric orbifolds, derived from a given one, whose integral cohomology is free of torsion and is concentrated in even degrees, a property which might be termed \emph{integrally equivariantly formal}. In all cases, it is possible to give a description of the cohomology ring and to relate it to the cohomology of the original orbifold.;math.AT
1801.04095;Sensitivity indices for independent groups of variables;In this paper, we study sensitivity indices for independent groups of variables and we look at the particular case of block-additive models. We show in this case that most of the Sobol indices are equal to zero and that Shapley effects can be estimated more efficiently. We then apply this study to Gaussian linear models, and we provide an efficient algorithm to compute the theoretical sensitivity indices. In numerical experiments, we show that this algorithm compares favourably to other existing methods. We also use the theoretical results to improve the estimation of the Shapley effects for general models, when the inputs form independent groups of variables.;math.ST
1801.04097;Exceptional and modern intervals of the Tamari lattice;In this article we use the theory of interval-posets recently introduced by Ch{\^a}tel and Pons in order to describe some interesting families of intervals in the Tamari lattices. These families are defined as interval-posets avoiding specific configurations. At first, we consider what we call exceptional interval-posets and show that they correspond to the intervals which are obtained as images of noncrossing trees in the Dendriform operad. We also show that the exceptional intervals are exactly the intervals of the Tamari lattice induced by intervals in the poset of noncrossing partitions. In the second part we introduce the notion of modern and infinitely modern interval-posets. We show that the modern intervals are in bijection with the new intervals of the Tamari lattice in the sense of Chapoton. We deduce an intrinsic characterization of the new intervals in the Tamari lattice. Finally, we consider the family of what we call infinitely modern intervals and we we prove that there are as many infinitely modern interval-posets of size n as there are ternary trees with n inner vertices.;math.CO
1801.04098;Combinatorics of compactified universal Jacobians;We use orientations on stable graphs to express the combinatorial structure of the compactified universal Jacobians in degrees g-1 and g over the moduli space of stable curves, \Mgb, and construct for them graded stratifications compatible with the one of \Mgb. In particular, for a stable curve we exhibit graded stratifications of the compactified Jacobians in terms of totally cyclic, respectively rooted, orientations on subgraphs of its dual graph.;math.AG
1801.04104;Multiple Antennas Secure Transmission under Pilot Spoofing and Jamming Attack;Transmitter-side channel state information (CSI) of the legitimate destination plays a critical role in physical layer secure transmissions. However, channel training procedure is vulnerable to the pilot spoofing attack (PSA) or pilot jamming attack (PJA) by an active eavesdropper (Eve), which inevitably results in severe private information leakage. In this paper, we propose a random channel training (RCT) based secure downlink transmission framework for a time division duplex (TDD) multiple antennas base station (BS). In the proposed RCT scheme, multiple orthogonal pilot sequences (PSs) are simultaneously allocated to the legitimate user (LU), and the LU randomly selects one PS from the assigned PS set to transmit. Under either the PSA or PJA, we provide the detailed steps for the BS to identify the PS transmitted by the LU, and to simultaneously estimate channels of the LU and Eve. The probability that the BS makes an incorrect decision on the PS of the LU is analytically investigated. Finally, closed-form secure beamforming (SB) vectors are designed and optimized to enhance the secrecy rates during the downlink transmissions. Numerical results show that the secrecy performance is greatly improved compared to the conventional channel training scheme wherein only one PS is assigned to the LU.;cs.IT
1801.04106;Perfect codes in generalized Fibonacci cubes;The {\em Fibonacci cube} of dimension $n$, denoted as $\Gamma\_n$, is the subgraph of the $n$-cube $Q\_n$ induced by vertices with no consecutive 1's. In an article of 2016 Ashrafi and his co-authors proved the non-existence of perfect codes in $\Gamma\_n$ for $n\geq 4$. As an open problem the authors suggest to consider the existence of perfect codes in generalization of Fibonacci cubes. The most direct generalization is the family $\Gamma\_n(1^s)$ of subgraphs induced by strings without $1^s$ as a substring where $s\geq 2$ is a given integer. We prove the existence of a perfect code in $\Gamma\_n(1^s)$ for $n=2^p-1$ and $s \geq 3.2^{p-2}$ for any integer $p\geq 2$.;math.CO
1801.04109;Couplings in $L^p$ distance of two Brownian motions and their L{&#xe9,}vy area;We study co-adapted couplings of (canonical hypoelliptic) diffu-sions on the (subRiemannian) Heisenberg group, that we call (Heisenberg) Brow-nian motions and are the joint laws of a planar Brownian motion with its L{\'e}vy area. We show that contrary to the situation observed on Riemannian manifolds of non-negative Ricci curvature, for any co-adapted coupling, two Heisenberg Brownian motions starting at two given points can not stay at bounded distance for all time t $\ge$ 0. Actually, we prove the stronger result that they can not stay bounded in L p for p $\ge$ 2. We also study the coupling by reflection, and show that it stays bounded in L p for 0 $\le$ p &lt, 1. Finally, we explain how the results generalise to the Heisenberg groups of higher dimension;math.PR
1801.04115;A Game Theoretic Approach to Hyperbolic Consensus Problems;We introduce the use of conservation laws to develop strategies in multi-player consensus games. First, basic well posedness results provide a reliable analytic setting. Then, a general non anticipative strategy is proposed through its rigorous analytic definitions and then tested by means of numerical integrations.;math.OC
1801.04121;Supercaloric functions for the porous medium equation;In the slow diffusion case unbounded supersolutions of the porous medium equation are of two totally different types, depending on whether the pressure is locally integrable or not. This criterion and its consequences are discussed.;math.AP
1801.04122;Robust error estimation for lowest-order approximation of nearly incompressible elasticity;We consider so-called Herrmann and Hydrostatic mixed formulations of classical linear elasticity and analyse the error associated with locally stabilised $P_1-P_0$ finite element approximation. First, we prove a stability estimate for the discrete problem and establish an a priori estimate for the associated energy error. Second, we consider a residual-based a posteriori error estimator as well as a local Poisson problem estimator. We establish bounds for the energy error that are independent of the Lam\'{e} coefficients and prove that the estimators are robust in the incompressible limit. A key issue to be addressed is the requirement for pressure stabilisation. Numerical results are presented that validate the theory. The software used is available online.;math.NA
1801.04125;Newton-Okounkov bodies and normal toric degenerations;Anderson proved that the finite generation of the value semigroup $\Gamma_{Y_\bullet}(D)$ in the construction of the Newton-Okounkov body $\Delta_{Y_\bullet}(D)$ induces a toric degeneration of the corresponding variety $X$ to some toric variety $X_0$. In this case the normalization of $X_0$ is the normal toric variety corresponding to the rational polytope $\Delta_{Y_\bullet}(D)$. Since $X_0$ is not normal in general this correspondence is rather implicit. In this article we investigate in conditions to assure that $X_0$ is normal, by comparing the Hilbert polynomial with the Ehrhart polynomial. <br />In the case of del Pezzo surfaces this will result in an algorithm which outputs for a given divisor $D$ a flag $Y_\bullet$ such that the value semigroup in question is indeed normal. Furthermore, we will find flags on del Pezzo surfaces and on some particular weak del Pezzo surfaces which induce normal toric degenerations for all possible divisors at once. We will prove that in this case the global value semigroup $\Gamma_{Y_\bullet}(X)$ is finitely generated and normal.;math.AG
1801.04126;Extending Whitney&#x27,s extension theorem: nonlinear function spaces;This article shows that there is a continuous extension operator for compactly-supported smooth sections of vector bundles on possibly non-compact smooth manifolds, where the closed set to which sections are restricted satisfy a mild restriction on possible boundary cusps. These function spaces are locally convex but in general not Fr\'echet and so one cannot use the existing theory for Fr\'echet spaces of smooth functions. Further, in the global, nonlinear case of all smooth functions between possibly non-compact smooth manifolds, we prove that the analogous restriction map between locally convex manifolds of smooth functions is a submersion in the sense of admitting continuous local splittings on charts, under the assumption the closed set is either a submanifold with corners, or is locally convex with rough boundary and compact. In all these results the spaces of functions are spaces of smooth functions, and not spaces of Whitney jets.;math.DG
1801.04128;Improved bounds on the multicolor Ramsey numbers of paths and even cycles;We study the multicolor Ramsey numbers for paths and even cycles, $R_k(P_n)$ and $R_k(C_n)$, which are the smallest integers $N$ such that every coloring of the complete graph $K_N$ has a monochromatic copy of $P_n$ or $C_n$ respectively. For a long time, $R_k(P_n)$ has only been known to lie between $(k-1+o(1))n$ and $(k + o(1))n$. A recent breakthrough by S\'ark\"ozy and later improvement by Davies, Jenssen and Roberts give an upper bound of $(k - \frac{1}{4} + o(1))n$. We improve the upper bound to $(k - \frac{1}{2}+ o(1))n$. Our approach uses structural insights in connected graphs without a large matching. These insights may be of independent interest.;math.CO
1801.04133;Eigenvalues of Dirichlet Laplacian within the class of open sets with constant diameter;This paper is about a shape optimization problem related to the Dirichlet Laplacian eingevalues in the Euclidean plane. More precisely we study the shape of the minimizer in the class of open sets of constant width. We prove that the disk is not a local minimizer except for a limited number of eigenvalues.;math.SP
1801.04136;First-passage times over moving boundaries for asymptotically stable walks;Let $\{S_n, n\geq1\}$ be a random walk wih independent and identically distributed increments and let $\{g_n,n\geq1\}$ be a sequence of real numbers. Let $T_g$ denote the first time when $S_n$ leaves $(g_n,\infty)$. Assume that the random walk is oscillating and asymptotically stable, that is, there exists a sequence $\{c_n,n\geq1\}$ such that $S_n/c_n$ converges to a stable law. In this paper we determine the tail behaviour of $T_g$ for all oscillating asymptotically stable walks and all boundary sequences satisfying $g_n=o(c_n)$. Furthermore, we prove that the rescaled random walk conditioned to stay above the boundary up to time $n$ converges, as $n\to\infty$, towards the stable meander.;math.PR
1801.04143;Local asymptotic self-similarity for heavy tailed harmonizable fractional L&#xe9,vy motions;In this work we characterize the local asymptotic self-similarity of harmonizable fractional L\'evy motions in the heavy tailed case. The corresponding tangent process is shown to be the harmonizable fractional stable motion. In addition, we provide sufficient conditions for existence of harmonizable fractional L\'evy motions.;math.PR
1801.04144;Second order models for optimal transport and cubic splines on the Wasserstein space;On the space of probability densities, we extend the Wasserstein geodesics to the case of higher-order interpolation such as cubic spline interpolation. After presenting the natural extension of cubic splines to the Wasserstein space, we propose a simpler approach based on the relaxation of the variational problem on the path space. We explore two different numerical approaches, one based on multi-marginal optimal transport and entropic regularization and the other based on semi-discrete optimal transport.;math.OC
1801.04146;Variational Second-Order Interpolation on the Group of Diffeomorphisms with a Right-Invariant Metric;In this note, we propose a variational framework in which the minimization of the acceleration on the group of diffeomorphisms endowed with a right-invariant metric is well-posed. It relies on constraining the acceleration to belong to a Sobolev space of higher-order than the order of the metric in order to gain compactness. It provides the theoretical guarantee of existence of minimizers which is compulsory for numerical simulations.;math.OC
1801.04155;Existence and Multiplicity for elliptic p-Laplacian problems with critical growth in the gradient;We consider the boundary value problem $-\Delta_p u = \lambda c(x) |u|^{p-2}u + \mu(x) |\grad u|^p + h(x)$, $u \in W^{1,p}_0(\Omega) \cap L^{\infty}(\Omega)$, where $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^N$, $N \geq 2$, is a bounded domain with smooth boundary. We assume $c$, $h \in L^q(\Omega)$ for some $q &gt, \max\{N/p,1\}$ with $c \gneqq 0$ and $\mu \in L^{\infty}(\Omega)$. We prove existence and uniqueness results in the coercive case $ \lambda \leq 0$ and existence and multiplicity results in the non-coercive case $ \lambda &gt,0$. Also, considering stronger assumptions on the coefficients, we clarify the structure of the set of solutions in the non-coercive case.;math.AP
1801.04165;On the Termination of the General XL Algorithm and Ordinary Multinomials;The XL algorithm is an algorithm for solving overdetermined systems of multivariate polynomial equations, which was initially introduced for quadratic equations. However, the algorithm works for polynomials of any degree, and in this paper we will focus on the performance of XL for polynomials of degree $\geq3$, where the optimal termination value of the parameter $D$ is still unknown. We prove that the XL algorithm terminates at a certain value of $D$ in the case that the number of equations exceeds the number of variables by 1 or 2. We also give strong evidence that this value is best possible, and we show that this value is smaller than the degree of regularity. Part of our analysis requires proving that ordinary multinomials are strongly unimodal, and this result may be of independent interest.;math.AC
1801.04172;Fast iterative solvers for an optimal transport problem;Optimal transport problems pose many challenges when considering their numerical treatment. We investigate the solution of a PDE-constrained optimisation problem subject to a particular transport equation arising from the modelling of image metamorphosis. We present the nonlinear optimisation problem, and discuss the discretisation and treatment of the nonlinearity via a Gauss--Newton scheme. We then derive preconditioners that can be used to solve the linear systems at the heart of the (Gauss--)Newton method. With the optical flow in mind, we further propose the reduction of dimensionality by choosing a radial basis function discretisation that uses the centres of superpixels as the collocation points. Again, we derive suitable preconditioners that can be used for this formulation.;math.NA
1801.04175;A fast spectral divide-and-conquer method for banded matrices;Based on the spectral divide-and-conquer algorithm by Nakatsukasa and Higham [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 35(3): A1325-A1349, 2013], we propose a new algorithm for computing all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric banded matrix. For this purpose, we combine our previous work on the fast computation of spectral projectors in the so called HODLR format, with a novel technique for extracting a basis for the range of such a HODLR matrix. The numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm exhibits quasilinear complexity and allows for conveniently dealing with large-scale matrices.;math.NA
1801.04176;Non-meagre subgroups of reals disjoint with meagre sets;Let $(X, +)$ denote $(\mathbb{R}, +)$ or $(2^{\omega}, +_2)$. We prove that for any meagre set $F \subseteq X$ there exists a subgroup $G \le X$ without the Baire property, disjoint with some translation of F. We point out several consequences of this fact and indicate why analogous result for the measure cannot be established in ZFC. We extend proof techniques from the work of Ros{\l}anowski and Shelah [1].;math.GN
1801.04178;The affine VW supercategory;We define the affine VW supercategory $\mathit{s}\hspace{-0.7mm}\bigvee\mkern-15mu\bigvee$, which arises from studying the action of the periplectic Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{p}(n)$ on the tensor product $M\otimes V^{\otimes a}$ of an arbitrary representation $M$ with several copies of the vector representation $V$ of $\mathfrak{p}(n)$. It plays a role analogous to that of the degenerate affine Hecke algebras in the context of representations of the general linear group, the main obstacle was the lack of a quadratic Casimir element in $\mathfrak{p}(n)\otimes \mathfrak{p}(n)$. When $M$ is the trivial representation, the action factors through the Brauer supercategory $\mathit{s}\mathcal{B}\mathit{r}$. Our main result is an explicit basis theorem for the morphism spaces of $\mathit{s}\hspace{-0.7mm}\bigvee\mkern-15mu\bigvee$ and, as a consequence, of $\mathit{s}\mathcal{B}\mathit{r}$. The proof utilises the close connection with the representation theory of $\mathfrak{p}(n)$. As an application we explicitly describe the centre of all endomorphism algebras, and show that it behaves well under the passage to the associated graded and under deformation.;math.RT
1801.04182;n-Torsion Clean Rings;Let n be an arbitrary natural number. The class of (strongly) n-torsion clean rings is introduced and investigated. Abelian n-torsion clean rings are somewhat characterized and a complete characterization of strongly n-torsion clean rings is given in the case when n is odd. Some open questions are posed at the end.;math.RA
1801.04189;Divisibility of L-Polynomials for a Family of Curves;We consider the question of when the L-polynomial of one curve divides the L-polynomial of another curve. A theorem of Tate gives an answer in terms of jacobians. We consider the question in terms of the curves. The last author gave an invited talk at the 12th International Conference on Finite Fields and Their Applications on this topic, and stated two conjectures. In this article we prove one of those conjectures.;math.AG
1801.04190;Youla Coding and Computation of Gaussian Feedback Capacity;In this paper, we propose an approach to numerically compute the feedback capacity of stationary finite dimensional Gaussian channels and construct (arbitrarily close to) capacity-achieving feedback codes. In particular, we first extend the interpretation of feedback communication over stationary finite dimensional Gaussian channels as feedback control systems by showing that, the problem of finding stabilizing feedback controllers with maximal reliable transmission rate over Youla parameters coincides with the problem of finding strictly causal filters to achieve feedback capacity derived in [2]. This extended interpretation provides an approach to construct deterministic feedback coding schemes with double exponential decaying error probability. We next propose asymptotic capacity-achieving upper bounds, which can be numerically evaluated by solving finite dimensional convex optimizations. From the filters that achieve the upper bounds, we apply the Youla-based interpretation to construct feasible filters, i.e., feedback codes, leading to a sequence of lower bounds. We prove the sequence of lower bounds is asymptotically capacity-achieving.;cs.IT
1801.04191;Computing permanents of complex diagonally dominant matrices and tensors;We prove that for any $\lambda &gt, 1$, fixed in advance, the permanent of an $n \times n$ complex matrix, where the absolute value of each diagonal entry is at least $\lambda$ times bigger than the sum of the absolute values of all other entries in the same row, can be approximated within any relative error $0 &lt, \epsilon &lt, 1$ in quasi-polynomial $n^{O(\ln n - \ln \epsilon)}$ time. We extend this result to multidimensional permanents of tensors and discuss its application to weighted counting of perfect matchings in hypergraphs.;math.CO
1801.04195;Periodic points of a Landen transformation;We prove the existence of 3-periodic orbits in a dynamical system associated to a Landen transformation previously studied by Boros, Chamberland and Moll, disproving a conjecture on the dynamics of this planar map introduced by the latter author. To this end we present a systematic methodology to determine and locate analytically isolated periodic points of algebraic maps. This approach can be useful to study other discrete dynamical systems with algebraic nature. Complementary results on the dynamics of the map associated with the Landen transformation are also presented.;math.DS
1801.04198;Non-integrability of the minimum-time Kepler problem;We prove that the minimum-time controlled Kepler problem is not Liouville integrable in the class of meromorphic functions, via the Moral\`es-Ramis theory.;math.DS
1801.04205;Determining Projection Constants of Univariate Polynomial Spaces;The long-standing problem of minimal projections is addressed from a computational point of view. Techniques to determine bounds on the projection constants of univariate polynomial spaces are presented. The upper bound, produced by a linear program, and the lower bound, produced by a semidefinite program exploiting the method of moments, are often close enough to deduce the projection constant with reasonable accuracy. The implementation of these programs makes it possible to find the projection constant of several three-dimensional spaces with five digits of accuracy, as well as the projection constants of the spaces of cubic, quartic, and quintic polynomials with four digits of accuracy. Beliefs about uniqueness and shape-preservation of minimal projections are contested along the way.;math.NA
1801.04209;Slant H-Toeplitz Operators on the Hardy space;The notion of slant H-Toeplitz operator $V_\phi$ on the Hardy space $H^2$ is introduced and its characterizations are obtained. We have shown that an operator on the space $H^2$ is slant H-Toeplitz if and only if its matrix is a slant H-Toeplitz matrix. In addition the conditions under which slant Toeplitz and slant Hankel operators become slant H-Toeplitz operators are also obtained.;math.FA
1801.04210;Asymptotic Dirichlet problems in warped products;We study the asymptotic Dirichlet problem for Killing graphs with prescribed mean curvature $H$ in warped product manifolds $M\times_\varrho \mathbb{R}$. In the first part of the paper, we prove the existence of Killing graphs with prescribed boundary on geodesic balls under suitable assumptions on $H$ and the mean curvature of the Killing cylinders over geodesic spheres. In the process we obtain a uniform interior gradient estimate improving previous results by Dajczer and de Lira. In the second part we solve the asymptotic Dirichlet problem in a large class of manifolds whose sectional curvatures are allowed to go to $0$ or to $-\infty$ provided that $H$satisfies certain bounds with respect to the sectional curvatures of $M$ and the norm of the Killing vector field. Finally we obtain non-existence results if the prescribed mean curvature function $H$ grows too fast.;math.DG
1801.04214;Heuristics in direction of a p-adic Brauer--Siegel theorem;Let p be a fixed prime number. Let K be a totally real number field of discriminant D\_K and let T\_K be the torsion group of the Galois group of the maximal abelian p-ramified pro-p-extension of K (under Leopoldt's conjecture). We conjecture the existence of a constant C\_p&gt,0 such that log(\#T\_K) $\le$ C\_p log(\sqrt(D\_K)) when K varies in some specified families (e.g., fields of fixed degree). In some sense, we suggest the existence of a p-adic analogue, of the classical Brauer--Siegel Theorem, wearing here on the valuation of the residue at s=1 (essentially equal to \#T\_K) of the p-adic zeta-function zeta\_p(s) of K.We shall use a different definition that of Washington, given in the 1980's, and approach this question via the arithmetical study of T\_K since p-adic analysis seems to fail because of possible abundant "Siegel zeros" of zeta\_p(s), contrary to the classical framework.We give extensive numerical verifications for quadratic and cubic fields (cyclic or not) and publish the PARI/GP programs directly usable by the reader for numerical improvements. Such a conjecture (if exact) reinforces our conjecture that any fixed number field K is p-rational (i.e., T\_K=1) for all p &gt,&gt, 0 .;math.NT
1801.04215;A unifying Perron-Frobenius theorem for nonnegative tensors via multi-homogeneous maps;Inspired by the definition of symmetric decomposition, we introduce the concept of shape partition of a tensor and formulate a general tensor spectral problem that includes all the relevant spectral problems as special cases. We formulate irreducibility and symmetry properties of a nonnegative tensor $T$ in terms of the associated shape partition. We recast the spectral problem for $T$ as a fixed point problem on a suitable product of projective spaces. This allows us to use the theory of multi-homogeneous order-preserving maps to derive a general and unifying Perron-Frobenius theorem for nonnegative tensors that either implies previous results of this kind or improves them by weakening the assumptions there considered. We introduce a general power method for the computation of the dominant tensor eigenpair, and provide a detailed convergence analysis.;math.SP
1801.04216;Poincar&#xe9, inequality on complete Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded below;We prove that complete Riemannian manifolds with polynomial growth and Ricci curvature bounded from below, admit uniform Poincar\'e inequalities. A global, uniform Poincar\'e inequality for horospheres in the universal cover of a closed, $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with pinched negative sectional curvature follows as a corollary.;math.DG
1801.04223;Machine Intelligence Techniques for Next-Generation Context-Aware Wireless Networks;The next generation wireless networks (i.e. 5G and beyond), which would be extremely dynamic and complex due to the ultra-dense deployment of heterogeneous networks (HetNets), poses many critical challenges for network planning, operation, management and troubleshooting. At the same time, generation and consumption of wireless data are becoming increasingly distributed with ongoing paradigm shift from people-centric to machine-oriented communications, making the operation of future wireless networks even more complex. In mitigating the complexity of future network operation, new approaches of intelligently utilizing distributed computational resources with improved context-awareness becomes extremely important. In this regard, the emerging fog (edge) computing architecture aiming to distribute computing, storage, control, communication, and networking functions closer to end users, have a great potential for enabling efficient operation of future wireless networks. These promising architectures make the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) principles which incorporate learning, reasoning and decision-making mechanism, as natural choices for designing a tightly integrated network. Towards this end, this article provides a comprehensive survey on the utilization of AI integrating machine learning, data analytics and natural language processing (NLP) techniques for enhancing the efficiency of wireless network operation. In particular, we provide comprehensive discussion on the utilization of these techniques for efficient data acquisition, knowledge discovery, network planning, operation and management of the next generation wireless networks. A brief case study utilizing the AI techniques for this network has also been provided.;cs.IT
1801.04224;Reducibility of first order linear operators on tori via Moser&#x27,s theorem;In this paper we prove reducibility of classes of linear first order operators on tori by applying a generalization of Moser's theorem on straightening of vector fields on a torus. We consider vector fields which are a $C^\infty$ perturbations of a constant vector field, and prove that they are conjugated --by a $C^\infty$ torus diffeomorphism-- to a constant diophantine flow, provided that the perturbation is small in some given $H^{s_1}$ norm and that the initial frequency is in some Cantor-like set. Actually in the classical results of this type the regularity of the change of coordinates which straightens the perturbed vector field coincides with the class of regularity in which the perturbation is required to be small. This improvement is achieved thanks to ideas and techniques coming from the Nash-Moser theory.;math.AP
1801.04229;List Decoding of Locally Repairable Codes;We show that locally repairable codes (LRCs) can be list decoded efficiently beyond the Johnson radius for a large range of parameters by utilizing the local error correction capabilities. The new decoding radius is derived and the asymptotic behavior is analyzed. We give a general list decoding algorithm for LRCs that achieves this radius along with an explicit realization for a class of LRCs based on Reed-Solomon codes (Tamo-Barg LRCs). Further, a probabilistic algorithm for unique decoding of low complexity is given and its success probability analyzed.;cs.IT
1801.04230;Asymptotics for the resolvent equation associated to the game-theoretic $p$-laplacian;We consider the (viscosity) solution $u^\varepsilon$ of the elliptic equation $\varepsilon^2\Delta_p^G u= u$ in a domain (not necessarily bounded), satisfying $u=1$ on its boundary. Here, $\Delta_p^G$ is the {\it game-theoretic or normalized $p$-laplacian}. We derive asymptotic formulas for $\varepsilon\to 0^+$ involving the values of $u^\varepsilon$, in the spirit of Varadhan's work \cite{Va}, and its $q$-mean on balls touching the boundary, thus generalizing that obtained in \cite{MS-AM} for $p=q=2$. As in a related parabolic problem, investigated in \cite{BM}, we link the relevant asymptotic behavior to the geometry of the domain.;math.AP
1801.04233;Artin group injection in the Hecke algebra for right-angled groups;For any Coxeter system we consider the algebra generated by the projections over the parabolic quotients. In the finite case it turn out that this algebra is isomorphic to the monoid algebra of the Coxeter monoid (0-Hecke algebra). In the infinite case it contains the Coxeter monoid algebra as a proper subalgebra. This construction provides a faithful integral representation of the Coxeter monoid algebra of any Coxeter system. As an application we will prove that a right-angled Artin group injects in Hecke algebra of the corresponding right-angled Coxeter group.;math.RT
1801.04236;A Manin-Mumford theorem for the maximal compact subgroup of a universal vectorial extension of a product of elliptic curves;We study the intersection of an algebraic variety with the maximal compact subgroup of a universal vectorial extension of a product of elliptic curves. For this intersection we show a Manin-Mumford type statement. This answers some questions posed by Corvaja-Masser-Zannier which arose in connection with their investigation of the intersection of a curve with real analytic subgroups of various algebraic groups. They prove finiteness in the situation of a single elliptic curve. Using Khovanskii's zero-estimates combined with a stratification result of Gabrielov-Vorobjov and recent work of the authors we obtain effective bounds for this intersection that only depend on the degree of the algebraic variety, and the dimension of the group. This seems new even if restricted to the classical Manin-Mumford statement.;math.NT
1801.04237;Inverse problem of potential theory;P. Novikov in 1938 has proved that if $u_1(x)=u_2(x)$ for $|x|&gt,R$, where $R&gt,0$ is a large number, $$u_j(x):=\int_{D_j}g_0(x,y)dy, \quad g_0(x,y):=\frac 1 {4\pi |x-y|},$$ and $D_j\subset \mathbb{R}^3$, $j=1,2,$ $D_j\subset B_R$, are bounded, connected, smooth domains, star-shaped with respect to a common point, then $D_1=D_2$. Here $B_R:= \{x: |x|\le R\}$. <br />Our basic results are: <br />a) the removal of the assumption about star-shapeness of $D_j$, <br />b) a new approach to the problem, <br />c) the construction of counter-examples for a similar problem in which $g_0$ is replaced by $g=\frac {e^{ik|x-y|}}{4\pi |x-y|}$, where $k&gt,0$ is a fixed constant.;math.AP
1801.04239;Commutative modified Rota-Baxter algebras, shuffle products and Hopf algebras;In this paper, we begin a systematic study of modified Rota-Baxter algebras, as an associative analogue of the modified classical Yang-Baxter equation. We construct free commutative modified Rota-Baxter algebras by a variation of the shuffle product and describe the structure both recursively and explicitly. We then provide these algebras with a Hopf algebra structure by applying a Hochschild cocycle.;math.RA
1801.04241;Optimal Streaming Codes for Channels with Burst and Arbitrary Erasures;This paper considers transmitting a sequence of messages (a streaming source) over a packet erasure channel. In each time slot, the source constructs a packet based on the current and the previous messages and transmits the packet, which may be erased when the packet travels from the source to the destination. Every source message must be recovered perfectly at the destination subject to a fixed decoding delay. We assume that the channel loss model introduces either one burst erasure or multiple arbitrary erasures in any fixed-sized sliding window. Under this channel loss assumption, we fully characterize the maximum achievable rate by constructing streaming codes that achieve the optimal rate. In addition, our construction of optimal streaming codes implies the full characterization of the maximum achievable rate for convolutional codes with any given column distance, column span and decoding delay. Numerical results demonstrate that the optimal streaming codes outperform existing streaming codes of comparable complexity over some instances of the Gilbert-Elliott channel and the Fritchman channel.;cs.IT
1801.04243;Inexact cuts in Deterministic and Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming applied to linear optimization problems;We introduce an extension of Dual Dynamic Programming (DDP) to solve linear dynamic programming equations. We call this extension IDDP-LP which applies to situations where some or all primal and dual subproblems to be solved along the iterations of the method are solved with a bounded error (inexactly). We provide convergence theorems both in the case when errors are bounded and for asymptotically vanishing errors. We extend the analysis to stochastic linear dynamic programming equations, introducing Inexact Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming for linear programs (ISDDP-LP), an inexact variant of SDDP applied to linear programs corresponding to the situation where some or all problems to be solved in the forward and backward passes of SDDP are solved approximately. We also provide convergence theorems for ISDDP-LP for bounded and asymptotically vanishing errors. Finally, we present the results of numerical experiments comparing SDDP and ISSDP-LP on a portfolio problem with direct transation costs modelled as a multistage stochastic linear optimization problem. On these experiments, ISDDP-LP allows us to obtain a good policy faster than SDDP.;math.OC
1801.04244;Porous medium equation with nonlocal pressure;We provide a rather complete description of the results obtained so far on the nonlinear diffusion equation $u_t=\nabla\cdot (u^{m-1}\nabla (-\Delta)^{-s}u)$, which describes a flow through a porous medium driven by a nonlocal pressure. We consider constant parameters $m&gt,1$ and $0&lt,s&lt,1$, we assume that the solutions are non-negative, and the problem is posed in the whole space. We present a theory of existence of solutions, results on uniqueness, and relation to other models. As new results of this paper, we prove the existence of self-similar solutions in the range when $N=1$ and $m&gt,2$, and the asymptotic behavior of solutions when $N=1$. The cases $m = 1$ and $m = 2$ were rather well known.;math.AP
1801.04250;Graph cover-saturation;Graph $G$ is $F$-saturated if $G$ contains no copy of graph $F$ but any edge added to $G$ produces at least one copy of $F$. One common variant of saturation is to remove the former restriction: $G$ is $F$-semi-saturated if any edge added to $G$ produces at least one new copy of $F$. In this paper we take this idea one step further. Rather than just allowing edges of $G$ to be in a copy of $F$, we require it: $G$ is $F$-covered if every edge of $G$ is in a copy of $F$. It turns out that there is smooth interaction between coverage and semi-saturation, which opens for investigation a natural analogue to saturation numbers. Therefore we present preliminary cover-saturation theory and structural bounds for the cover-saturation numbers of graphs. We also establish asymptotic cover-saturation densities for cliques and paths, and upper and lower bounds (with small gaps) for cycles and stars.;math.CO
1801.04254;Optimal data-driven estimation of generalized Markov state models for non-equilibrium dynamics;There are multiple ways in which a stochastic system can be out of statistical equilibrium. It might be subject to time-varying forcing, or be in a transient phase on its way towards equilibrium, it might even be in equilibrium without us noticing it, due to insufficient observations, and it even might be a system failing to admit an equilibrium distribution at all. We review some of the approaches that model the effective statistical behavior of equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamical systems, and show that both cases can be considered under the unified framework of optimal low-rank approximation of so-called transfer operators. Particular attention is given to the connection between these methods, Markov state models, and the concept of metastability, further to the estimation of such reduced order models from finite simulation data. We illustrate our considerations by numerical examples.;math.DS
1801.04257;On projective and affine equivalence of sub-Riemannian metrics;Consider a smooth manifold $M$ equipped with a bracket generating distribution $D$. Two sub-Riemannian metrics on $(M,D)$ are said to be projectively (resp. affinely) equivalent if they have the same geodesics up to reparameterization (resp. up to affine reparameterization). A sub-Riemannian metric $g$ is called rigid (resp. conformally rigid) with respect to projective/affine equivalence, if any sub-Riemannian metric which is projectively/affinely equivalent to $g$ is constantly proportional to $g$ (resp. conformal to $g$). In the Riemannian case the local classification of projectively and affinely equivalent metrics is classical (Levi-Civita, Eisenhart). In particular, a Riemannian metric which is not rigid satisfies the following two special properties: its geodesic flow possesses nontrivial integrals and the metric induces certain canonical product structure on the ambient manifold. These classification results were extended to contact and quasi-contact distributions by Zelenko. Our general goal is to extend these results to arbitrary sub-Riemannian manifolds, and we establish two types of results toward this goal: if a sub-Riemannian metric is not projectively conformally rigid, then, first, its flow of normal extremals has at least one nontrivial integral quadratic on the fibers of the cotangent bundle and, second, the nilpotent approximation of the underlying distribution at any point admits a product structure. As a consequence we obtain two types of genericity results: first, we show that a generic sub-Riemannian metric on a fixed pair $(M,D)$ is projectively conformally rigid. Second, we prove that, except for special pairs $(m,n)$, every sub-Riemannian metric on a rank $m$ generic distribution in an $n$-dimensional manifold is projectively conformally rigid. For the affine equivalence in both genericity results conformal rigidity can be replaced by usual rigidity.;math.DG
1801.04259;The smallest Laplace eigenvalue of homogeneous 3-spheres;We establish an explicit expression for the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of the Laplace--Beltrami operator on every homogeneous metric on the 3-sphere, or equivalently, on SU(2) endowed with left-invariant metric. For the subfamily of 3-dimensional Berger spheres, we obtain a full description of their spectra. We also give several consequences of the mentioned expression. One of them improves known estimates for the smallest non-zero eigenvalue in terms of the diameter for homogeneous 3-spheres. Another application shows that the spectrum of the Laplace--Beltrami operator distinguishes up to isometry any left-invariant metric on SU(2). It is also proved the non-existence of constant scalar curvature metrics conformal and arbitrarily close to any non-round homogeneous metric on the 3-sphere. All of the above results are extended to left-invariant metrics on SO(3), that is, homogeneous metrics on the 3-dimensional real projective space.;math.DG
1801.04262;A note on Herglotz&#x27,s theorem for time series on function spaces;In this article, we prove Herglotz's theorem for Hilbert-valued time series. This requires the notion of an operator-valued measure, which we shall make precise for our setting. Herglotz's theorem for functional time series allows to generalize existing results that are central to frequency domain analysis on the function space. In particular, we use this result to prove the existence of a functional Cram{\'e}r representation of a large class of processes, including those with jumps in the spectral distribution and long-memory processes. We furthermore obtain an optimal finite dimensional reduction of the time series under weaker assumptions than available in the literature. The results of this paper therefore enable Fourier analysis for processes of which the spectral density operator does not necessarily exist.;math.ST
1801.04272;On the projective height zero conjecture;Recently, Malle and Navarro put forward a projective version of Brauer's celebrated height zero conjecture on blocks of finite groups. In this short note we show that Brauer's original conjecture implies the projective version.;math.RT
1801.04273;Integral cohomology of configuration spaces of the sphere;We compute the cohomology of the unordered configuration spaces of the sphere $S^2$ with integral and with $\mathbb{Z}/p \mathbb{Z}$-coefficients using a cell complex by Fuks, Vainshtein and Napolitano.;math.AT
1801.04285;Analysis of hyper-singular, fractional, and order-zero singular integral operators;In this article, we conduct a study of integral operators defined in terms of non-convolution type kernels with singularities of various degrees. The operators that fall within our scope of research include fractional integrals, fractional derivatives, pseudodifferential operators, Calder\'on-Zygmund operators, and many others. The main results of this article are built around the notion of an operator calculus that connects operators with different kernel singularities via vanishing moment conditions and composition with fractional derivative operators. We also provide several boundedness results on weighted and unweighted distribution spaces, including homogeneous Sobolev, Besov, and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces, that are necessary and sufficient for the operator's vanishing moment properties, as well as certain behaviors for the operator under composition with fractional derivative and integral operators. As applications, we prove $T1$ type theorems for singular integral operators with different singularities, boundedness results for pseudodifferential operators belonging to the forbidden class $S_{1,1}^0$, fractional order and hyper-singular paraproduct boundedness, a smooth-oscillating decomposition for singular integrals, sparse domination estimates that quantify regularity and oscillation, and several operator calculus results. It is of particular interest that many of these results do not require $L^2$-boundedness of the operator, and furthermore, we apply our results to some operators that are known not to be $L^2$-bounded.;math.FA
1801.04296;Acyclic anyon models, thermal anyon error corrections, and braiding universality;Acyclic anyon models are non-abelian anyon models for which thermal anyon errors can be corrected. In this note, we characterize acyclic anyon models and raise the question if the restriction to acyclic anyon models is a deficiency of the current protocol or could it be intrinsically related to the computational power of non-abelian anyons. We also obtain general results on acyclic anyon models and find new acyclic anyon models such as $SO(8)_2$ and untwisted Dijkgraaf-Witten theories of nilpotent finite groups.;math.QA
1801.04299;Belief Propagation Decoding of Polar Codes on Permuted Factor Graphs;We show that the performance of iterative belief propagation (BP) decoding of polar codes can be enhanced by decoding over different carefully chosen factor graph realizations. With a genie-aided stopping condition, it can achieve the successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding performance which has already been shown to achieve the maximum likelihood (ML) bound provided that the list size is sufficiently large. The proposed decoder is based on different realizations of the polar code factor graph with randomly permuted stages during decoding. Additionally, a different way of visualizing the polar code factor graph is presented, facilitating the analysis of the underlying factor graph and the comparison of different graph permutations. In our proposed decoder, a high rate Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) code is concatenated with a polar code and used as an iteration stopping criterion (i.e., genie) to even outperform the SCL decoder of the plain polar code (without the CRC-aid). Although our permuted factor graph-based decoder does not outperform the SCL-CRC decoder, it achieves, to the best of our knowledge, the best performance of all iterative polar decoders presented thus far.;cs.IT
1801.04301;A Family of Tractable Graph Distances;Important data mining problems such as nearest-neighbor search and clustering admit theoretical guarantees when restricted to objects embedded in a metric space. Graphs are ubiquitous, and clustering and classification over graphs arise in diverse areas, including, e.g., image processing and social networks. Unfortunately, popular distance scores used in these applications, that scale over large graphs, are not metrics and thus come with no guarantees. Classic graph distances such as, e.g., the chemical and the CKS distance are arguably natural and intuitive, and are indeed also metrics, but they are intractable: as such, their computation does not scale to large graphs. We define a broad family of graph distances, that includes both the chemical and the CKS distance, and prove that these are all metrics. Crucially, we show that our family includes metrics that are tractable. Moreover, we extend these distances by incorporating auxiliary node attributes, which is important in practice, while maintaining both the metric property and tractability.;math.CO
1801.04310;Flow Decomposition for Multi-User Channels - Part I;A framework based on the idea of flow decomposition is proposed to characterize the decode-forward region for general multi-source, multi-relay, all-cast channels with independent input distributions. The region is difficult to characterize directly when deadlocks occur between two relay nodes, in which both relays benefit by decoding after each other. Rate-vectors in the decode-forward region depend ambiguously on the outcomes of all deadlocks in the channel. The region is characterized indirectly in two phases. The first phase assumes relays can operate non-causally. It is shown that every rate-vector in the decode-forward region corresponds to a set of flow decompositions, which describe the messages decoded at each node with respect to the messages forwarded by all the other nodes. The second phase imposes causal restrictions on the relays. Given an arbitrary set of (possibly non-causal) flow decompositions, necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of an equivalent set of causal flow decompositions that achieves the same rate-vector region.;cs.IT
1801.04312;A characterisation of $&#x3c4,$-tilting finite algebras;We prove that a finite dimensional algebra is $\tau$-tilting finite if and only if it does not admit large silting modules. Moreover, we show that for a $\tau$-tilting finite algebra $A$ there is a bijection between isomorphism classes of basic support $\tau$-tilting (that is, finite dimensional silting) modules and equivalence classes of ring epimorphisms $A\longrightarrow B$ with ${\rm Tor}_1^A(B,B)=0$. It follows that a finite dimensional algebra is $\tau$-tilting finite if and only if there are only finitely many equivalence classes of such ring epimorphisms.;math.RT
1801.04313;On the convergence of iterative solvers for polygonal discontinuous Galerkin discretizations;We study the convergence of iterative linear solvers for discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of systems of hyperbolic conservation laws with polygonal mesh elements compared with that of traditional triangular elements. We solve the semi-discrete system of equations by means of an implicit time discretization method, using iterative solvers such as the block Jacobi method and GMRES. We perform a von Neumann analysis to analytically study the convergence of the block Jacobi method for the two-dimensional advection equation on four classes of regular meshes: hexagonal, square, equilateral-triangular, and right-triangular. We find that hexagonal and square meshes give rise to smaller eigenvalues, and thus result in faster convergence of Jacobi's method. We perform numerical experiments with variable velocity fields, irregular, unstructured meshes, and the Euler equations of gas dynamics to confirm and extend these results. We additionally study the effect of polygonal meshes on the performance of block ILU(0) and Jacobi preconditioners for the GMRES method.;math.NA
1801.04322;Corner cases, singularities, and dynamic factoring;In Eikonal equations, rarefaction is a common phenomenon known to degrade the rate of convergence of numerical methods. The `factoring' approach alleviates this difficulty by deriving a PDE for a new (locally smooth) variable while capturing the rarefaction-related singularity in a known (non-smooth) `factor'. Previously this technique was successfully used to address rarefaction fans arising at point sources. In this paper we show how similar ideas can be used to factor the 2D rarefactions arising due to nonsmoothness of domain boundaries or discontinuities in PDE coefficients. Locations and orientations of such rarefaction fans are not known in advance and we construct a `just-in-time factoring' method that identifies them dynamically. The resulting algorithm is a generalization of the Fast Marching Method originally introduced for the regular (unfactored) Eikonal equations. We show that our approach restores the first-order convergence and illustrate it using a range of maze navigation examples with non-permeable and `slowly permeable' obstacles.;math.NA
1801.04325;Hopf bifurcation and period functions for Wright type delay differential equations;We present the simplest criterion that determines the direction of the Hopf bifurcations of the delay differential equation $x'(t)=-\mu f(x(t-1))$, as the parameter $\mu$ passes through the critical values $\mu_k$. We give a complete classification of the possible bifurcation sequences. Using this information and the Cooke-transformation, we obtain local estimates and monotonicity properties of the periods of the bifurcating limit cycles along the Hopf-branches. Further, we show how our results relate to the often required property that the nonlinearity has negative Schwarzian derivative.;math.DS
1801.04327;La th&#xe9,orie arithm&#xe9,tique des grandeurs alg&#xe9,briques de Kronecker (1882);This article attempts at a linear historical and mathematical commentary of Kronecker's programmatic memoir "Grundz\"uge einer arithmetischen Theorie der algebraischen Gr\"ossen" (1882).;math.HO
1801.04339;Estimating the Number of Connected Components in a Graph via Subgraph Sampling;Learning properties of large graphs from samples has been an important problem in statistical network analysis since the early work of Goodman \cite{Goodman1949} and Frank \cite{Frank1978}. We revisit a problem formulated by Frank \cite{Frank1978} of estimating the number of connected components in a large graph based on the subgraph sampling model, in which we randomly sample a subset of the vertices and observe the induced subgraph. The key question is whether accurate estimation is achievable in the \emph{sublinear} regime where only a vanishing fraction of the vertices are sampled. We show that it is impossible if the parent graph is allowed to contain high-degree vertices or long induced cycles. For the class of chordal graphs, where induced cycles of length four or above are forbidden, we characterize the optimal sample complexity within constant factors and construct linear-time estimators that provably achieve these bounds. This significantly expands the scope of previous results which have focused on unbiased estimators and special classes of graphs such as forests or cliques. <br />Both the construction and the analysis of the proposed methodology rely on combinatorial properties of chordal graphs and identities of induced subgraph counts. They, in turn, also play a key role in proving minimax lower bounds based on construction of random instances of graphs with matching structures of small subgraphs.;math.ST
1801.04352;On the Capacity Region of the Deterministic Y-Channel with Common and Private Messages;In multi user Gaussian relay networks, it is desirable to transmit private information to each user as well as common information to all of them. However, the capacity region of such networks with both kinds of information is not easy to characterize. The prior art used simple linear deterministic models in order to approximate the capacities of these Gaussian networks. This paper discusses the capacity region of the deterministic Y-channel with private and common messages. In this channel, each user aims at delivering two private messages to the other two users in addition to a common message directed towards both of them. As there is no direct link between the users, all messages must pass through an intermediate relay. We present outer-bounds on the rate region using genie aided and cut-set bounds. Then, we develop a greedy scheme to define an achievable region and show that at a certain number of levels at the relay, our achievable region coincides with the upper bound. Finally, we argue that these bounds for this setup are not sufficient to characterize the capacity region.;cs.IT
1801.04359;Queue-aware Energy Efficient Control for Dense Wireless Networks;We consider the problem of long term power allocation in dense wireless networks. The framework considered in this paper is of interest for machine-type communications (MTC). In order to guarantee an optimal operation of the system while being as power efficient as possible, the allocation policy must take into account both the channel and queue states of the devices. This is a complex stochastic optimization problem, that can be cast as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) over a huge state space. In order to tackle this state space explosion, we perform a mean-field approximation on the MDP. Letting the number of devices grow to infinity the MDP converges to a deterministic control problem. By solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation, we obtain a well-performing power allocation policy for the original stochastic problem, which turns out to be a threshold-based policy and can then be easily implemented in practice.;cs.IT
1801.04360;Rational Solutions of the Painlev&#xe9,-III Equation;All of the six Painlev\'e equations except the first have families of rational solutions, which are frequently important in applications. The third Painlev\'e equation in generic form depends on two parameters $m$ and $n$, and it has rational solutions if and only if at least one of the parameters is an integer. We use known algebraic representations of the solutions to study numerically how the distributions of poles and zeros behave as $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ increases and how the patterns vary with $m\in\mathbb{C}$. This study suggests that it is reasonable to consider the rational solutions in the limit of large $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ with $m\in\mathbb{C}$ being an auxiliary parameter. To analyze the rational solutions in this limit, algebraic techniques need to be supplemented by analytical ones, and the main new contribution of this paper is to develop a Riemann-Hilbert representation of the rational solutions of Painlev\'e-III that is amenable to asymptotic analysis. Assuming further that $m$ is a half-integer, we derive from the Riemann-Hilbert representation a finite dimensional Hankel system for the rational solution in which $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ appears as an explicit parameter.;math.CA
1801.04361;Two problems in Partial Differential Equations (in Portuguese);In this work, we examine two important problems in the theory of nonlinear PDEs. In Part I, we propose and solve a more general and complete version of the celebrated Leray's problem for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $ \mathbb{R}^{3} \!$, which in its simplest form was suggested by J.$\,$Leray in 1934 (and solved only in the 1980s by T.$\,$ Kato, K.$\,$Masuda and other authors). A number of related new results of clear interest to the theory of Leray's solutions are also given here. <br />In Part II, which is independent of Part I and can be read separately, we introduce an important new collection of problems concerning global existence results and blow-up phenomena for solutions of conservative advection-diffusion equations in $ \mathbb{R}^{n} $ where heterogeneities in the lower order terms tend to destabilize the solution (everywhere or in certain regions), strongly competing with the viscous dissipation effects to determine the overall solution behavior. Here, we consider the case of superlinear advection (and arbitrary dimension), which may cause finite-time blow-up in several important spaces. We then point out a new kind of phenomena --- one that may be properly named "anti-Fujita" for its vivid contrast to the type of blow-up behavior discovered by Fujita in the 1960s, and which has been investigated ever since --- that has apparently been completely overlooked in the literature.;math.AP
1801.04363;Design of accurate formulas for approximating functions in weighted Hardy spaces by discrete energy minimization;We propose a simple and effective method for designing approximation formulas for weighted analytic functions. We consider spaces of such functions according to weight functions expressing the decay properties of the functions. Then, we adopt the minimum worst error of the $n$-point approximation formulas in each space for characterizing the optimal sampling points for the approximation. In order to obtain approximately optimal sampling points, we consider minimization of a discrete energy related to the minimum worst error. Consequently, we obtain an approximation formula and its theoretical error estimate in each space. In addition, from some numerical experiments, we observe that the formula generated by the proposed method outperforms the corresponding formula derived with sinc approximation, which is near optimal in each space.;math.NA
1801.04366;Estimation in the group action channel;We analyze the problem of estimating a signal from multiple measurements on a $\mbox{group action channel}$ that linearly transforms a signal by a random group action followed by a fixed projection and additive Gaussian noise. This channel is motivated by applications such as multi-reference alignment and cryo-electron microscopy. We focus on the large noise regime prevalent in these applications. We give a lower bound on the mean square error (MSE) of any asymptotically unbiased estimator of the signal's orbit in terms of the signal's moment tensors, which implies that the MSE is bounded away from 0 when $N/\sigma^{2d}$ is bounded from above, where $N$ is the number of observations, $\sigma$ is the noise standard deviation, and $d$ is the so-called $\mbox{moment order cutoff}$. In contrast, the maximum likelihood estimator is shown to be consistent if $N /\sigma^{2d}$ diverges.;cs.IT
1801.04369;Is profile likelihood a true likelihood? An argument in favor;Profile likelihood is the key tool for dealing with nuisance parameters in likelihood theory. It is often asserted, however, that profile likelihood is not a 'true' likelihood. One implication is that likelihood theory lacks the generality of e.g. Bayesian inference, wherein marginalization is the universal tool for dealing with nuisance parameters. Here we argue that profile likelihood has as much claim to being a true likelihood as a marginal probability has to being a true probability distribution. The crucial point we argue is that a likelihood function is naturally interpreted as a maxitive possibility measure: given this, the associated theory of integration with respect to maxitive measures delivers profile likelihood as the direct analogue of marginal probability in additive measure theory. Thus, given a background likelihood function, we argue that profiling over the likelihood function is as natural (or as unnatural, as the case may be) as marginalizing over a background probability measure. The connections to Bayesian inference can also be further clarified with the introduction of a suitable logarithmic distance function, in which case the present theory can be naturally described as 'Tropical Bayes' in the sense of tropical algebra.;math.ST
1801.04383;Cohomology rings of compactifications of toric arrangements;Some projective wonderful models for the complement of a toric arrangement in a n-dimensional algebraic torus T were constructed in [3]. In this paper we describe their integer cohomology rings by generators and relations.;math.AT
1801.04384;Distributed Multi-User Secret Sharing;We consider a distributed secret sharing system that consists of a dealer, $n$ storage nodes, and $m$ users. Each user is given access to a certain subset of storage nodes, where it can download the stored data. The dealer wants to securely convey a specific secret $s_j$ to user $j$ via storage nodes, for $j=1,2,\dots,m$, in such a way that no user gets any information about other users' secrets in an information-theoretic sense. To this end, the dealer encodes secrets into several secret shares and loads them into the storage nodes. Given a certain number of storage nodes we find the maximum number of users that can be served in such systems and construct schemes that achieve this. We further define two major properties for such distributed secret sharing systems, \emph{communication complexity} is defined as the total amount of data that users need to download in order to reconstruct their secrets, and \emph{storage overhead} is defined as the total size of data loaded by the dealer into the storage nodes normalized by the total size of secrets. Lower bounds on minimum communication complexity and storage overhead are characterized given any $n$ and $m$. Furthermore, we construct distributed secret sharing protocols, under certain conditions on the system parameters, that simultaneously attain these lower bounds, thereby providing schemes that are optimal in terms of both the communication complexity and the storage overhead. It is shown how to modify the proposed protocols in order to construct schemes with \emph{balanced} storage load and communication complexity.;cs.IT
1801.04392;Certain quaternary quadratic forms of level 48 and their representation numbers;In this paper, we find a basis for the space of modular forms of weight $2$ on $\Gamma_1(48)$. We use this basis to find formulas for the number of representations of a positive integer $n$ by certain quaternary quadratic forms of the form $\sum_{i=1}^4 a_i x_i^2$, $\sum_{i=1}^2 b_i(x_{2i-1}^2 + x_{2i-1}x_{2i}+x_{2i}^2)$ and $a_1x_1^2 + a_2 x_2^2 + b_1(x_3^2+x_3x_4+x_4^2)$, where $a_i$'s belong to $\{1,2,3,4,6,12\}$ and $b_i$'s belong to $\{1,2,4,8,16\}$.;math.NT
1801.04397;A Context-free Grammar for Peaks and Double Descents of Permutations;This paper is concerned with the joint distribution of the number of exterior peaks and the number of proper double descents over permutations on $[n] =\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. The notion of exterior peaks of a permutation was introduced by Aguiar, Bergeron and Nyman in their study of the peak algebra. Gessel obtained the generating function of the number of permutations on $[n]$ with a given number of exterior peaks. On the other hand, by establishing differential equations, Elizalde and Noy derived the generating function for the number of permutations on $[n]$ with a given number of proper double descents. Barry and Basset independently deduced the generating function of the number of permutations on $[n]$ with no proper double descents. We find a context-free grammar which can be used to compute the number of permutations on $[n]$ with a given number of exterior peaks and a given number of proper double descents. Based on the grammar, the recurrence relation of the number of permutations on $[n]$ with a given number of exterior peaks can be easily obtained. Moreover, we use the grammatical calculus to derive the generating function without solving differential equations. Our formula reduces to the formulas of Gessel, Elizalde-Noy, Barry, and Basset. Finally, from the grammar we establish a relationship between our generating function and the generating function of the joint distribution of the number of peaks and the number of double descent derived by Carlitz and Scoville.;math.CO
1801.04398;Ricci solitons in almost $f$-cosymplectic manifolds;In this article we study an almost $f$-cosymplectic manifold admitting a Ricci soliton. We first prove that there do not exist Ricci solitons on an almost cosymplectic $(\kappa,\mu)$-manifold. Further, we consider an almost $f$-cosymplectic manifold admitting a Ricci soliton whose potential vector field is the Reeb vector field and show that a three dimesional almost $f$-cosymplectic is a cosymplectic manifold. Finally we classify a three dimensional $\eta$-Einstein almost $f$-cosymplectic manifold admitting a Ricci soliton.;math.DG
1801.04402;A comparison of two mathematical models of the cerebrospinal fluid dynamics;In this paper we provide the numerical simulations of two cerebrospinal fluid dynamics models by comparing our results with the real data available in literature. The models describe different processes in the cerebrospinal fluid dynamics: the cerebrospinal flow in the ventricles of the brain and the reabsorption of the fluid. In the appendix we show in detail the mathematical analysis of both models and we identify the set of initial conditions for which the solutions of the systems of equations do not exhibit blow up. We investigate step by step the accuracy of these theoretical outcomes with respect to the real cerebrospinal physiology and dynamics.;math.AP
1801.04404;Convexification of a 3-D coefficient inverse scattering problem;A version of the so-called "convexification" numerical method for a coefficient inverse scattering problem for the 3D Hemholtz equation is developed analytically and tested numerically. Backscattering data are used, which result from a single direction of the propagation of the incident plane wave on an interval of frequencies. The method converges globally. The idea is to construct a weighted Tikhonov-like functional. The key element of this functional is the presence of the so-called Carleman Weight Function (CWF). This is the function which is involved in the Carleman estimate for the Laplace operator. This functional is strictly convex on any appropriate ball in a Hilbert space for an appropriate choice of the parameters of the CWF. Thus, both the absence of local minima and convergence of minimizers to the exact solution are guaranteed. Numerical tests demonstrate a good performance of the resulting algorithm. Unlikeprevious the so-called tail functions globally convergent method, we neither do not impose the smallness assumption of the interval of wavenumbers, nor we do not iterate with respect to the so-called tail functions.;math.NA
1801.04409;On semisimplification of tensor categories;We develop the theory of semisimplifications of tensor categories defined by Barrett and Westbury. In particular, we compute the semisimplification of the category of representations of a finite group in characteristic $p$ in terms of representations of the normnalizer of its Sylow $p$-subgroup. This allows us to compute the semisimplification of the representation category of the symmetric group $S_{n+p}$ in characteristic $p$, where $0\le n\le p-1$, and of the Deligne category $\underline{\rm Rep}^{\rm ab}S_t$, where $t\in \Bbb N$. We also compute the semisimplification of the category of representations of the Kac-De Concini quantum group of the Borel subalgebra of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$. We also study tensor functors between Verlinde categories of semisimple algebraic groups arising from the semisimplification construction, and objects of finite type in categories of modular representations of finite groups (i.e., objects generating a fusion category in the semisimplification). Finally, we determine the semisimplifications of the tilting categories of $GL(n)$, $SL(n)$ and $PGL(n)$ in characteristic $2$. In the appendix, we classify categorifications of the Grothendieck ring of representations of $SO(3)$ and its truncations.;math.RT
1801.04410;Reduction of wide subcategories and recollements;In this paper, we prove that if an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$ admits a recollement relative to abelian categories $\mathcal{A}'$ and $\mathcal{A}''$, there is a bijection between wide subcategories in $\mathcal{A}$ containing $i_{*}(\mathcal{A}')$ and wide subcategories in $\mathcal{A}''$ similar to silting reduction and $\tau$-tilting reduction. Moreover, the wide subcategory $\mathcal{C}$ of $\mathcal{A}$ containing $i_{*}(\mathcal{A}')$ admits a new recollement relative to wide subcategories $\mathcal{A}'$ and $j^{*}(\mathcal{C})$ which induced from the original recollement.;math.RT
1801.04412;Energy bound for Kapustin-Witten solutions on $S^3\times\mathbb{R}^+$;We consider solutions of Kapustin-Witten equation with Nahm pole boundary on $S^3\times \mathbb{R}^+$. These solutions are usually called Nahm pole solutions. In this paper, we will prove that there exists a constant $C&gt,0$ such that $\|F_A\|_{L^2}\leq C$ for any Nahm pole solution $(A,\phi)$.;math.DG
1801.04420;LDPC Codes over Gaussian Multiple Access Wiretap Channel;We study the problem of two-user Gaussian multiple access channel (GMAC) in the presence of an external eavesdropper. In this problem, an eavesdropper receives a signal with a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to the legitimate receiver and all transmitted messages should be kept confidential against the eavesdropper. For this purpose, we propose a secure coding scheme on this channel which utilizes low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes by employing random bit insertion and puncturing techniques. At each encoder, the confidential message with some random bits as a random message are systematically encoded, and then the associated bits to the confidential message are punctured. Next, the encoders send their unpunctured bits over a Gaussian multiple access wiretap channel (GMAC-WT). The puncturing distribution applied to the LDPC code is considered in two cases: random and optimized. We utilize a modified extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart analysis to optimize the puncturing distribution for each encoder. The security gap is used as a measure of secrecy for the sent messages over GMAC-WT which should be made as small as possible. We compare the achieved secure rate pair with an achievable secrecy rate region of GMAC-WT to show the effective performance of the proposed scheme. In this paper, equal and unequal power conditions at the transmitters are investigated. For both cases, we attain a fairly small security gap which is equivalent to achieve the points near the secrecy rate region of GMAC-WT.;cs.IT
1801.04422;Asymptotic Distribution of Multilevel Channel Polarization for a Certain Class of Erasure Channels;This study examines multilevel channel polarization for a certain class of erasure channels that the input alphabet size is an arbitrary composite number. We derive limiting proportions of partially noiseless channels for such a class. The results of this study are proved by an argument of convergent sequences, inspired by Alsan and Telatar's simple proof of polarization, and without martingale convergence theorems for polarization process.;cs.IT
1801.04424;Prikry Forcing and Tree Prikry Forcing of Various Filters;In this paper, we answer a question asked in "A minimal Prikry type forcing for singularizing a measurable cardinal" regarding a Mathias criteria for Tree-Prikry forcing. Also we will investigate Prikry forcing using various filters. For completeness and self inclusion reasons, we will give proofs of many known theorems.;math.LO
1801.04427;Sparse NOMA: A Closed-Form Characterization;Understanding fundamental limits of the various technologies suggested for future 5G and beyond cellular systems is crucial for developing efficient state-of-the-art designs. A leading technology of major interest is non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA). In this paper, we derive an explicit rigorous closed-form analytical expression for the optimum spectral efficiency in the large-system limit of regular sparse NOMA, where only a fixed and finite number of orthogonal resources are allocated to any designated user, and vice versa. The basic Verd\'u-Shamai formula for (dense) randomly-spread code-division multiple-access (RS-CDMA) turns out to coincide with the limit of the derived expression, when the number of orthogonal resources per user grows large. Furthermore, regular sparse NOMA is rigorously shown to be spectrally more efficient than RS-CDMA across the entire system load range. It may therefore serve as an efficient means for reducing the throughput gap to orthogonal transmission in the underloaded regime, and to the ultimate Cover-Wyner bound in overloaded systems. The results analytically reinforce preliminary conclusions in [1], which mostly relied on heuristics and numerical observations. The spectral efficiency is also derived in closed form for the suboptimal linear minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE) receiver, which again extends the corresponding Verd\'u-Shamai LMMSE formula to regular sparse NOMA.;cs.IT
1801.04428;Bi-Lipschitz characteristic of quasiconformal self-mappings of the unit disk satisfying bi-harmonic equation;Suppose that $f$ is a $K$-quasiconformal self-mapping of the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$, which satisfies the following: $(1)$ the biharmonic equation $\Delta(\Delta f)=g$ $(g\in \mathcal{C}(\overline{\mathbb{D}}))$, (2) the boundary condition $\Delta f=\varphi$ ($\varphi\in\mathcal{C}(\mathbb{T})$ and $\mathbb{T}$ denotes the unit circle), and $(3)$ $f(0)=0$. The purpose of this paper is to prove that $f$ is Lipschitz continuos, and, further, it is bi-Lipschitz continuous when $\|g\|_{\infty}$ and $\|\varphi\|_{\infty}$ are small enough. Moreover, the estimates are asymptotically sharp as $K\to 1$, $\|g\|_{\infty}\to 0$ and $\|\varphi\|_{\infty}\to 0$, and thus, such a mapping $f$ behaves almost like a rotation for sufficiently small $K$, $\|g\|_{\infty}$ and $\|\varphi\|_{\infty}$.;math.CV
1801.04431;On behavior of a class of mappings in terms of prime ends;The paper is devoted to the study of mappings with finite distortion, actively studied recently. For mappings whose inverse satisfy the Poletsky inequality, the results on boundary behavior in terms of prime ends are obtained. In particular, it was proved that the families of the indicated mappings are equicontinuous at the points of the boundary if a certain function determining the distortion of the module under the mappings is integrable in a given domain.;math.CV
1801.04436;Aperiodic Sampled-Data Control via Explicit Transmission Mapping: A Set Invariance Approach;Event-triggered and self-triggered control have been proposed in recent years as promising control strategies to reduce communication resources in Networked Control Systems (NCSs). Based on the notion of set-invariance theory, this note presents new self-triggered control strategies for linear discrete-time systems subject to input and state constraints. The proposed schemes not only achieve communication reduction for NCSs, but also ensure both asymptotic stability of the origin and constraint satisfactions. A numerical simulation example validates the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.;math.OC
1801.04439;Variable-Length Resolvability for Mixed Sources and its Application to Variable-Length Source Coding;In the problem of variable-length $\delta$-channel resolvability, the channel output is approximated by encoding a variable-length uniform random number under the constraint that the variational distance between the target and approximated distributions should be within a given constant $\delta$ asymptotically. In this paper, we assume that the given channel input is a mixed source whose components may be general sources. To analyze the minimum achievable length rate of the uniform random number, called the $\delta$-resolvability, we introduce a variant problem of the variable-length $\delta$-channel resolvability. A general formula for the $\delta$-resolvability in this variant problem is established for a general channel. When the channel is an identity mapping, it is shown that the $\delta$-resolvability in the original and variant problems coincide. This relation leads to a direct derivation of a single-letter formula for the $\delta$-resolvability when the given source is a mixed memoryless source. We extend the result to the second-order case. As a byproduct, we obtain the first-order and second-order formulas for fixed-to-variable length source coding allowing error probability up to $\delta$.;cs.IT
1801.04441;Secure Communications in NOMA System: Subcarrier Assignment and Power Allocation;Secure communication is a promising technology for wireless networks because it ensures secure transmission of information. In this paper, we investigate the joint subcarrier (SC) assignment and power allocation problem for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) amplify-and-forward two-way relay wireless networks, in the presence of eavesdroppers. By exploiting cooperative jamming (CJ) to enhance the security of the communication link, we aim to maximize the achievable secrecy energy efficiency by jointly designing the SC assignment, user pair scheduling and power allocation. Assuming the perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) at the relay station, we propose a low-complexity subcarrier assignment scheme (SCAS-1), which is equivalent to many-to-many matching games, and then SCAS-2 is formulated as a secrecy energy efficiency maximization problem. The secure power allocation problem is modeled as a convex geometric programming problem, and then solved by interior point methods. Simulation results demonstrate that the effectiveness of the proposed SSPA algorithms under scenarios of using and not using CJ, respectively.;cs.IT
1801.04443;$L^{2}$ harmonic forms on complete special holonomy manifolds;In this article, we consider $L^{2}$ harmonic forms on a complete non-compact Riemannian manifold $X$ with a nonzero parallel form $\omega$. The main result is that if $(X,\omega)$ is a complete $G_{2}$- ( or $Spin(7)$-) manifold with a $d$(linear) $G_{2}$- (or $Spin(7)$-) structure form $\omega$, the $L^{2}$ harmonic $2$-forms on $X$ will be vanish. As an application, we prove that the instanton equation with square integrable curvature on $(X,\omega)$ only has trivial solution. We would also consider the Hodge theory on the principal $G$-bundle $E$ over $(X,\omega)$.;math.DG
1801.04444;Double Dirichlet series associated with arithmetic functions;We consider double Dirichlet series associated with arithmetic functions such as the von Mangoldt function, the M\"obius function, and so on. We show analytic continuations of them by use of the Mellin-Barnes integral. Furthermore we observe their reverse values at non-positive integer points.;math.NT
1801.04445;On distributional chaos in non-autonomous discrete systems;This paper studies distributional chaos in non-autonomous discrete systems generated by given sequences of maps in metric spaces. In the case that the metric space is compact, it is shown that a system is Li-Yorke{\delta}-chaotic if and only if it is distributionally{\delta}'-chaotic in a sequence, and three criteria of distributional {\delta}-chaos are established, which are caused by topologically weak mixing, asymptotic average shadowing property, and some expanding condition, respectively, where {\delta} and {\delta}' are positive constants. In a general case, a criterion of distributional chaos in a sequence induced by a Xiong chaotic set is established.;math.DS
1801.04447;The existence of horizontal envelopes in the 3D-Heisenberg group;By using the support function on the $xy$-plane, we show the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of envelopes of horizontal lines in the 3D-Heisenberg group. A method to construct horizontal envelopes from the given ones is also derived, and we classify the solutions satisfying the construction.;math.DG
1801.04449;Uniqueness and reconstruction for the fractional Calder&#xf3,n problem with a single measurement;We show global uniqueness in the fractional Calder\'on problem with a single measurement and with data on arbitrary, possibly disjoint subsets of the exterior. The previous work \cite{GhoshSaloUhlmann} considered the case of infinitely many measurements. The method is again based on the strong uniqueness properties for the fractional equation, this time combined with a unique continuation principle from sets of measure zero. We also give a constructive procedure for determining an unknown potential from a single exterior measurement, based on constructive versions of the unique continuation result that involve different regularization schemes.;math.AP
1801.04450;The mixed Tate property of reductive groups;This thesis is concerned with the mixed Tate property of reductive algebraic groups $G$, which in particular guarantees a Chow Kunneth property for the classifying space $BG$. Toward this goal, we first refine the construction of the compactly supported motive of a quotient stack. <br />In the first section, we construct the compactly supported motive $M^c(X)$ of an algebraic space $X$ and demonstrate that it satisfies expected properties, following closely Voevodsky's work in the case of schemes. <br />In the second section, we construct a functorial version of Totaro's definition of the compactly supported motive $M^c([X/G])$ for any quotient stack $[X/G]$ where $X$ is an algebraic space and $G$ is an affine group scheme acting on it. A consequence of functoriality is a localization triangle for these motives. <br />In the third section, we study the mixed Tate property for the classical groups as well as the exceptional group $G_2$. For these groups, we demonstrate that all split forms satisfy the mixed Tate property, while exhibiting non-split forms that do not. Finally, we prove that for any affine group scheme $G$ and normal split unipotent subgroup $J$ of $G$, the motives $M^c(BG)$ and $M^c(B(G/J))$ are isomorphic.;math.AG
1801.04459;Graph Laplace and Markov operators on a measure space;The main goal of this paper is to build a measurable analogue to the theory of weighted networks on infinite graphs. Our basic setting is an infinite $\sigma$-finite measure space $(V, \mathcal B, \mu)$ and a symmetric measure $\rho$ on $(V\times V, \mathcal B\times \mathcal B)$ supported by a measurable symmetric subset $E\subset V\times V$. This applies to such diverse areas as optimization, graphons (limits of finite graphs), symbolic dynamics, measurable equivalence relations, to determinantal processes, to jump-processes, and it extends earlier studies of infinite graphs $G = (V, E)$ which are endowed with a symmetric weight function $c_{xy}$ defined on the set of edges $E$. As in the theory of weighted networks, we consider the Hilbert spaces $L^2(\mu), L^2(c\mu)$ and define two other Hilbert spaces, the dissipation space $Diss$ and finite energy space $\mathcal H_E$. Our main results include a number of explicit spectral theoretic and potential theoretic theorems that apply to two realizations of Laplace operators, and the associated jump-diffusion semigroups, one in $L^2(\mu)$, and, the second, its counterpart in $\mathcal H_E$. We show in particular that it is the second setting (the energy-Hilbert space and the dissipation Hilbert space) which is needed in a detailed study of transient Markov processes.;math.FA
1801.04462;Boolean functions: noise stability, non-interactive correlation distillation, and mutual information;Let $T_{\epsilon}$ be the noise operator acting on Boolean functions $f:\{0, 1\}^n\to \{0, 1\}$, where $\epsilon\in[0, 1/2]$ is the noise parameter. Given $\alpha&gt,1$ and fixed mean $\mathbb{E} f$, which Boolean function $f$ has the largest $\alpha$-th moment $\mathbb{E}(T_\epsilon f)^\alpha$? This question has close connections with noise stability of Boolean functions, the problem of non-interactive correlation distillation, and Courtade-Kumar's conjecture on the most informative Boolean function. In this paper, we characterize maximizers in some extremal settings, such as low noise ($\epsilon=\epsilon(n)$ is close to 0), high noise ($\epsilon=\epsilon(n)$ is close to 1/2), as well as when $\alpha=\alpha(n)$ is large. Analogous results are also established in more general contexts, such as Boolean functions defined on discrete torus $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^n$ and the problem of noise stability in a tree model.;math.PR
1801.04463;A Belief Propagation Algorithm for Multipath-Based SLAM;We present a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm that is based on radio signals and the association of specular multipath components (MPCs) with geometric features. Especially in indoor scenarios, robust localization from radio signals is challenging due to diffuse multipath propagation, unknown MPC-feature association, and limited visibility of features. In our approach, specular reflections at flat surfaces are described in terms of virtual anchors (VAs) that are mirror images of the physical anchors (PAs). The positions of these VAs and possibly also of the PAs are unknown. We develop a Bayesian model of the SLAM problem and represent it by a factor graph, which enables the use of belief propagation (BP) for efficient marginalization of the joint posterior distribution. The resulting BP-based SLAM algorithm detects the VAs associated with the PAs and estimates jointly the time-varying position of the mobile agent and the positions of the VAs and possibly also of the PAs, thereby leveraging the MPCs in the radio signal for improved accuracy and robustness of agent localization. The algorithm has a low computational complexity and scales well in all relevant system parameters. Experimental results using both synthetic measurements and real ultra-wideband radio signals demonstrate the excellent performance of the algorithm in challenging indoor environments.;cs.IT
1801.04466;Lattice Erasure Codes of Low Rank with Noise Margins;We consider the following generalization of an $(n,k)$ MDS code for application to an erasure channel with additive noise. Like an MDS code, our code is required to be decodable from any $k$ received symbols, in the absence of noise. In addition, we require that the noise margin for every allowable erasure pattern be as large as possible and that the code satisfy a power constraint. In this paper we derive performance bounds and present a few designs for low rank lattice codes for an additive noise channel with erasures.;cs.IT
1801.04469;On the equivalence of the Mizoguchi-Takahashi locally contractive map to Nadler&#x27,s locally contractive map;In this article, we have proved the equivalence between the Mizoguchi-Takahashi uniformly~locally~contractive map to the multi-valued map satisfying the Nadler contractive condition uniformly~locally~on a metrically convex space.;math.FA
1801.04474;An invariant related to the existence of conformally compact Einstein fillings;We define an invariant for compact spin manifolds $X$ of dimension $4k$ equipped with a metric $h$ of positive Yamabe invariant on its boundary. The vanishing of this invariant is a necessary condition for the conformal class of $h$ to be the conformal infinity of a conformally compact Einstein metric on $X$.;math.DG
1801.04475;On fully residually-$\mathcal{R}$ groups;We consider the class $\mathcal{R}$ of finitely generated toral relatively hyperbolic groups. We show that groups from $\mathcal{R}$ are commutative transitive and generalize a theorem proved by Benjamin Baumslag to this class. We also discuss two definitions of (fully) residually-$\mathcal{C}$ groups and prove the equivalence of the two definitions for $\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{R}$. This is a generalization of the similar result obtained by Ol'shanskii for $\mathcal{C}$ being the class of torsion-free hyperbolic groups. Let $\Gamma\in\mathcal{R}$ be non-abelian and non-elementary. We prove that every finitely generated fully residually-$\Gamma$ group embeds into a group from $\mathcal{R}$. On the other hand, we give an example of a finitely generated torsion-free fully residually-$\mathcal{H}$ group that does not embed into a group from $\mathcal{R}$, $\mathcal{H}$ is the class of hyperbolic groups.;math.GR
1801.04476;Cosupports and minimal pure-injective resolutions of affine rings;We prove that any affine ring $R$ over a field $k$ has full cosupport, i.e., the cosupport of $R$ is equal to ${\rm Spec}\, R$. Using this fact, we give a complete description of all terms in a minimal pure-injective resolution of $R$, provided that $|k|=\aleph_1$ and ${\rm dim}\, R\geq 2$, or $|k|\geq \aleph_1$ and ${\rm dim}\, R=2$. As a corollary, we obtain a partial answer to a conjecture by Gruson.;math.AC
1801.04477;Dimension Reduction for the Landau-de Gennes Model: The Vanishing Nematic Correlation Length Limit;We study nematic liquid crystalline films within the framework of the Landau-de Gennes theory in the limit when both the thickness of the film and the nematic correlation length are vanishingly small compared to the lateral extent of the film. We prove $\Gamma$-convergence for a sequence of singularly perturbed functionals with a potential vanishing on a high-dimensional set and a Dirichlet condition imposed on admissible functions. This then allows us to prove the existence of local minimizers of the Landau-de Gennes energy in the spirit of a theorem due to Kohn and Sternberg despite the lack of compactness arising from the high-dimensional structure of the wells. The limiting energy consists of leading order perimeter terms, similar to Allen-Cahn models, and lower order terms arising from vortex structures reminiscent of Ginzburg-Landau models.;math.AP
1801.04481;Density of power-free values of polynomials;We establish asymptotic formulae for the number of $k$-free values of polynmilas $F(x_1,\cdots,x_n)\in\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\cdots,x_n]$ of degree $d\geq 2$ for any $n\geq 1$, including when the variables are prime, as long as $k\geq (3d+1)/4$. Thus we generalize a work of Browning, while we use a different sieveing technique for the middle range of primes.;math.NT
1801.04483;Waring&#x27,s Theorem for Binary Powers;A natural number is a binary $k$'th power if its binary representation consists of $k$ consecutive identical blocks. We prove an analogue of Waring's theorem for sums of binary $k$'th powers. More precisely, we show that for each integer $k \geq 2$, there exists a positive integer $W(k)$ such that every sufficiently large multiple of $E_k := \gcd(2^k - 1, k)$ is the sum of at most $W(k)$ binary $k$'th powers. (The hypothesis of being a multiple of $E_k$ cannot be omitted, since we show that the $\gcd$ of the binary $k$'th powers is $E_k$.) Also, we explain how our results can be extended to arbitrary integer bases $b &gt, 2$.;math.NT
1801.04484;2D problems in groups;We investigate a conjecture about stabilisation of deficiency in finite index subgroups and relate it to the D2 Problem of C.T.C. Wall and the Relation Gap problem. We verify the pro-$p$ version of the conjecture, as well as its higher dimensional abstract analogues.;math.GR
1801.04485;Persistence of one-dimensional AR(1)-sequences;For a class of one-dimensional autoregressive processes $(X_n)$ we consider the tail behaviour of the stopping time $T_0=\min \lbrace n\geq 1: X_n\leq 0 \rbrace$. We discuss existing general analytical approaches to this and related problems and propose a new one, which is based on a renewal-type decomposition for the moment generating function of $T_0$ and on the analytical Fredholm alternative. Using this method, we show that $\mathbb{P}_x(T_0=n)\sim V(x)R_0^n$ for some $0&lt,R_0&lt,1$ and a positive $R^{-1}_0$-harmonic function $V$. Further we prove that our conditions on the tail behaviour of the innovations are sharp in the sense that fatter tails produce non-exponential decay factors.;math.PR
1801.04488;An asymptotically compatible meshfree quadrature rule for non-local problems with applications to peridynamics;We present a meshfree quadrature rule for compactly supported non-local integro-differential equations (IDEs) with radial kernels. We apply this rule to develop a strong-form meshfree discretization of a peridynamic solid mechanics model that requires no background mesh. Existing discretizations of peridynamic models have been shown to exhibit a lack of asymptotic compatibility to the corresponding linearly elastic local solution. By posing the quadrature rule as an equality constrained least squares problem, we obtain asymptotically compatible convergence via reproducability constraints. Our approach naturally handles traction-free conditions, surface effects, and damage modeling for both static and dynamic problems. We demonstrate high-order convergence to the local theory by comparing to manufactured solutions and to cases with crack singularities for which an analytic solution is available. Finally, we verify the applicability of the approach to realistic problems by reproducing high-velocity impact results from the Kalthoff-Winkler experiments.;math.NA
1801.04489;A Stochastic Singular Vector Based MIMO Channel Model for MAC Layer Tracking;A novel stochastic technique is presented to directly model singular vectors and singular values of a multiple input multiple output channel. Thus the component smodeled directly in the eigen domain can be adapted to exhibit realistic physical domain behavior when assembled. The model exploites natural paths of eigenmodes, such that a simple Doppler filter generator process can be used. Furthermore it is possible to directly manipulate the singular vector dynamics in a way that an unrealistic "stress channel" can be modeled in the eigen domain. This is particularly useful for testing the eigenmode channel tracking ability internal to a communication device such as a modem, where impairments in tracking will cause interference between eigenmodes. The model can also facilitate mode tracking testing as it directly produces tracked ungtangled eigenmodes, providing the narrowest possible singular vector Doppler spectra and consequently lowest required update rates of each eigenmode. The singular vector based model targets testing of the eigen domain functionality of MIMO modems/devices, an apparatus focus, without the need for including the decomposition stages.;cs.IT
1801.04491;Irreversible investment with fixed adjustment costs: a stochastic impulse control approach;We consider an optimal stochastic impulse control problem over an infinite time horizon motivated by a model of irreversible investment choices with fixed adjustment costs. By employing techniques of viscosity solutions and relying on semiconvexity arguments, we prove that the value function is a classical solution to the associated quasi-variational inequality. This enables us to characterize the structure of the continuation and action regions and construct an optimal control. Finally, we focus on the linear case, discussing, by a numerical analysis, the sensitivity of the solution with respect to the relevant parameters of the problem.;math.OC
1801.04492;An Explicit Convergence Rate for Nesterov&#x27,s Method from SDP;The framework of Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQC) introduced by Lessard et al. (2014) reduces the computation of upper bounds on the convergence rate of several optimization algorithms to semi-definite programming (SDP). In particular, this technique was applied to Nesterov's accelerated method (NAM). For quadratic functions, this SDP was explicitly solved leading to a new bound on the convergence rate of NAM, and for arbitrary strongly convex functions it was shown numerically that IQC can improve bounds from Nesterov (2004). Unfortunately, an explicit analytic solution to the SDP was not provided. In this paper, we provide such an analytical solution, obtaining a new general and explicit upper bound on the convergence rate of NAM, which we further optimize over its parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best, and explicit, upper bound on the convergence rate of NAM for strongly convex functions.;math.OC
1801.04495;Model Predictive Control in Spacecraft Rendezvous and Soft Docking;This paper discusses translation and attitude control in spacecraft rendezvous and soft docking. The target spacecraft orbit can be either circular or elliptic. The high fidelity model for this problem is intrinsically a nonlinear system but can be viewed as a linear time varying system (LTV). Therefore, a model predictive control (MPC) based design is proposed to deal with the time-varying feature of the problem. A robust pole assignment method is used in the MPC-based design because of the following merits and/or considerations: (a) no overshoot of the relative position and attitude between the target and the chaser to achieve soft docking by placing all closed-loop poles in the negative real axis of the complex plan, which avoids oscillation of the relative position and attitude, in particular, in the final stage, (b) fast on-line computation, (c) modeling error tolerance, and (d) disturbance rejection. We will discuss these considerations and merits, and use a design simulation to demonstrate that the desired performance is indeed achieved.;math.OC
1801.04500;A forcing relation of braids from Nielsen fixed point theory;In this paper, we focus our attention on the connections between the braid group and the Nielsen fixed point theory.

1801.04501;Extinction and coming down from infinity of CB-processes with competition in a L&#xe9,vy environment;In this note, we are interested on the event of extinction and the property of coming down from infinity of continuous state branching (or CB for short) processes with competition in a L\'evy environment whose branching mechanism satisfies the so-called Grey's condition. In particular, we deduce, under the assumption that the L\'evy environment does not drift towards infinity, that for any starting point the process becomes extinct in finite time a.s. Moreover if we impose an integrability condition on the competition mechanism, then the process comes down from infinity regardless the long term behaviour of the environment.;math.PR
1801.04502;Saturated configuration and new large construction of equiangular lines;A set of lines through the origin in Euclidean space is called equiangular when any pair of lines from the set intersects with each other at a common angle. We study the maximum size of equiangular lines in Euclidean space and use graph theoretic approach to prove that all the currently known construction for maximum equiangular lines in $\mathbb R^d$ cannot add another line to form a larger equiangular set of lines if $14 \leq d \leq 20$ and $d \neq 15$. We give new constructions of large equiangular lines which are 248 equiangular lines in $\mathbb R^{42}$, 200 equiangular lines in $\mathbb{R}^{41}$, 168 equiangular lines in $\mathbb{R}^{40}$, 152 equiangular lines in $\mathbb R^{39}$ with angle $1/7$, and 56 equiangular lines in $\mathbb R^{18}$ with angle $1/5$.;math.CO
1801.04504;Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for mmWave Drone Networks with Limited Feedback;Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) base stations (BSs) can be a promising solution to provide connectivity and quality of service (QoS) guarantees during temporary events and after disasters. In this paper, we consider a scenario where UAV-BSs are serving large number of mobile users in a hot spot area (e.g., in a stadium). We introduce non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission at UAV-BSs to serve more users simultaneously considering user distances as the available feedback for user ordering during NOMA formulation. With millimeter-wave (mmWave) transmission and multi-antenna techniques, we assume UAV-BS generates directional beams and multiple users are served simultaneously within the same beam. However, due to the limitations of physical vertical beamwidth of the UAV-BS beam, it may not be possible to cover the entire user region at UAV altitudes of practical relevance. During such situations, a beam scanning approach is proposed to maximize the achievable sum rates. We develop a comprehensive framework over which outage probabilities and respective sum rates are derived rigorously and we investigate the optimal operational altitude of UAV-BS to maximize the sum rates using our analytical framework. Our analysis shows that NOMA with distance feedback can provide better outage sum rates compared to orthogonal multiple access.;cs.IT
1801.04507;Schwarz type lemma, Landau type theorem and Lipschitz type space of solutions to biharmonic equations;The purpose of this paper is to study the properties of the solutions to the biharmonic equations: $\Delta(\Delta f)=g$, where $g:$ $\overline{\mathbb{D}}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ is a continuous function and $\overline{\mathbb{D}}$ denotes the closure of the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$ in the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$. In fact, we establish the following properties for those solutions: Firstly, we establish the Schwarz type lemma. Secondly, by using the obtained results, we get a Landau type theorem. Thirdly, we discuss their Lipschitz type property.;math.CV
1801.04509;Admissible sequences for positive operators;A sequence of scalars is said to be admissible for a positive operator A on a Hilbert space if it is the diagonal of VAV* for some partial isometry V having as domain the closure of the range of A. When A is a projection, the celebrated Kadison's carpenter theorem provides a sufficient condition for a sequence to be admissible for A. We prove that the same condition is sufficient for the sequence to be admissible for A when A is a sum of projections (converging in the SOT). This provides an independent proof of Kadison's carpenter theorem.;math.OA
1801.04511;Regularity of Desingularised Models for Vortex Filaments in Incompressible Viscous Flows: A Geometrical Approach;We establish the regularity of weak solutions for the vorticity equation associated to a family of desingularised models for vortex filament dynamics in 3D incompressible viscous flows. These include and generalise the classical model "of an allowance for the thickness of the vortices" due to Louis Rosenhead in 1930. Our approach is based on an interplay between the geometry of vorticity and analytic inequalities in Sobolev spaces.;math.AP
1801.04512;Boundary Regularity for Asymptotically Hyperbolic Metrics with Smooth Weyl Curvature;In this paper, we study the regularity of asymptotically hyperbolic metrics with Einstein condition near boundary and Weyl curvature smooth enough in arbitrary dimension. Following Michael Anderson's method, we show that $C^{m,\alpha}$ conformally compact Riemannian metrics with Einstein equation vanishing to finite order near boundary have conformal compactifications that are $C^{m+2,\alpha}$ up to the boundary when Weyl curvature is in $C^{m,\alpha}$ and the boundary metric is in $C^{m+2,\alpha}$ where $m\geq 3.$;math.DG
1801.04517;Polynomial stability of exact solution and a numerical method for stochastic differential equations with time-dependent delay;Polynomial stability of exact solution and modified truncated Euler-Maruyama method for stochastic differential equations with time-dependent delay are investigated in this paper. By using the well known discrete semimartingale convergence theorem, sufficient conditions are obtained for both bounded and unbounded delay $\delta$ to ensure the polynomial stability of the corresponding numerical approximation. Examples are presented to illustrate the conclusion.;math.PR
1801.04519;Linear maps preserve the covariance sets;Let $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$\ are $C^{{\huge \ast}}% $-algebras\textbf{.} A\textbf{ }linear map $\phi:\mathcal{A\rightarrow B}$ is $C^{\ast}$-Jordan homomorphism if it is a Jordan homomorphism which preserves the adjoint operation.

1801.04525;Covariance in the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism and the Maurer-Cartan equation for curved Lie algebras;We express covariance of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism in classical mechanics by means of the Maurer-Cartan equation in a curved Lie superalgebra, defined using the formal variational calculus and Sullivan's Thom-Whitney construction. We use this framework to construct a Batalin-Vilkovisky canonical transformation identifying the Batalin-Vilkovisky formulation of the spinning particle with an AKSZ field theory.;math-ph
1801.04527;The maximum diam theorem on Finsler manifolds;We prove that, for a Finsler space, if the weighted Ricci curvature is bounded below by a positive number and the diam attains its maximal value, then it is isometric to a standard Finsler sphere. As an application, we show that the first eigenvalue of the Finsler-Laplacian attains its lower bound if and only if the Finsler manifold is isometric to a standard Finsler sphere, and moreover, we obtain an explicit 1-st eigenfunction on the sphere.;math.DG
1801.04531;Regularity of stochastic nonlocal diffusion equations;In this paper, we are concerned with regularity of nonlocal stochastic partial differential equations of parabolic type. By using Companato estimates and Sobolev embedding theorem, we first show the H\"{o}lder continuity (locally in the whole state space $\mathbb{R}^d$) for mild solutions of stochastic nonlocal diffusion equations in the sense that the solutions $u$ belong to the space $C^{\gamma}(D_T,L^p(\Omega))$ with the optimal H\"{o}lder continuity index $\gamma$ (which is given explicitly), where $D_T:=[0,T]\times D$ for $T&gt,0$, and $D\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ being a bounded domain. Then, by utilising tail estimates, we are able to obtain the estimates of mild solutions in $L^p(\Omega,C^{\gamma^*}(D_T))$. What's more, we give an explicit formula between the two index $\gamma$ and $\gamma^*$. Moreover, we prove H\"{o}lder continuity for mild solutions on bounded domains. Finally, we present a new criteria to justify H\"{o}lder continuity for the solutions on bounded domains. The novelty of this paper is that our method are suitable to the case of time-space white noise.;math.PR
1801.04537;Compressed Neighbour Discovery using Sparse Kerdock Matrices;We study the network-wide neighbour discovery problem in wireless networks in which each node in a network must discovery the network interface addresses (NIAs) of its neighbours. We work within the rapid on-off division duplex framework proposed by Guo and Zhang (2010) in which all nodes are assigned different on-off signatures which allow them listen to the transmissions of neighbouring nodes during their off slots, leading to a compressed sensing problem at each node with a collapsed codebook determined by a given node's transmission signature. We propose sparse Kerdock matrices as codebooks for the neighbour discovery problem. These matrices share the same row space as certain Delsarte-Goethals frames based upon Reed Muller codes, whilst at the same time being extremely sparse. We present numerical experiments using two different compressed sensing recovery algorithms, One Step Thresholding (OST) and Normalised Iterative Hard Thresholding (NIHT). For both algorithms, a higher proportion of neighbours are successfully identified using sparse Kerdock matrices compared to codebooks based on Reed Muller codes with random erasures as proposed by Zhang and Guo (2011). We argue that the improvement is due to the better interference cancellation properties of sparse Kerdock matrices when collapsed according to a given node's transmission signature. We show by explicit calculation that the coherence of the collapsed codebooks resulting from sparse Kerdock matrices remains near-optimal.;cs.IT
1801.04545;Throughput Maximization for UAV-Enabled Wireless Powered Communication Networks;This paper studies an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless powered communication network (WPCN), in which a UAV is dispatched as a mobile access point (AP) to serve a set of ground users periodically. The UAV employs the radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) to charge the users in the downlink, and the users use the harvested RF energy to send independent information to the UAV in the uplink. Unlike the conventional WPCN with fixed APs, the UAV-enabled WPCN can exploit the mobility of the UAV via trajectory design, jointly with the wireless resource allocation optimization, to maximize the system throughput. In particular, we aim to maximize the uplink common (minimum) throughput among all ground users over a finite UAV's flight period, subject to its maximum speed constraint and the users' energy neutrality constraints. The resulted problem is non-convex and thus difficult to be solved optimally. To tackle this challenge, we first consider an ideal case without the UAV's maximum speed constraint, and obtain the optimal solution to the relaxed problem. The optimal solution shows that the UAV should successively hover above a finite number of ground locations for downlink WPT, as well as above each of the ground users for uplink communication. Next, we consider the general problem with the UAV's maximum speed constraint. Based on the above multi-location-hovering solution, we first propose an efficient successive hover-and-fly trajectory design, jointly with the downlink and uplink wireless resource allocation, and then propose a locally optimal solution by applying the techniques of alternating optimization and successive convex programming (SCP). Numerical results show that the proposed UAV-enabled WPCN achieves significant throughput gains over the conventional WPCN with fixed-location AP.;cs.IT
1801.04548;Frame Moments and Welch Bound with Erasures;The Welch Bound is a lower bound on the root mean square cross correlation between $n$ unit-norm vectors $f_1,...,f_n$ in the $m$ dimensional space ($\mathbb{R} ^m$ or $\mathbb{C} ^m$), for $n\geq m$. Letting $F = [f_1|...|f_n]$ denote the $m$-by-$n$ frame matrix, the Welch bound can be viewed as a lower bound on the second moment of $F$, namely on the trace of the squared Gram matrix $(F'F)^2$. We consider an erasure setting, in which a reduced frame, composed of a random subset of Bernoulli selected vectors, is of interest. We extend the Welch bound to this setting and present the {\em erasure Welch bound} on the expected value of the Gram matrix of the reduced frame. Interestingly, this bound generalizes to the $d$-th order moment of $F$. We provide simple, explicit formulae for the generalized bound for $d=2,3,4$, which is the sum of the $d$-th moment of Wachter's classical MANOVA distribution and a vanishing term (as $n$ goes to infinity with $\frac{m}{n}$ held constant). The bound holds with equality if (and for $d = 4$ only if) $F$ is an Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF). Our results offer a novel perspective on the superiority of ETFs over other frames in a variety of applications, including spread spectrum communications, compressed sensing and analog coding.;cs.IT
1801.04549;Divergent Trajectories in Arithmetic Homogeneous Spaces of Rational Rank Two;Let $G$ be a real algebraic group defined over $\mathbb{Q}$, $\Gamma$ be an arithmetic subgroup of $G$, and $T$ be a maximal $\mathbb{R}$-split torus. A trajectory in $G/\Gamma$ is divergent if eventually it leaves every compact subset. In some cases there is a finite collection of explicit algebraic data which account for the divergence. If this is the case, the divergent trajectory is called obvious. Given a closed cone in $T$, we study the existence of non-obvious divergent trajectories under its action in $G/\Gamma$. We get a sufficient condition for the existence of a non-obvious divergence trajectory in the general case, and a full classification under the assumption that $\mbox{rank}_{\mathbb{Q}}G=\mbox{rank}_{\mathbb{R}}G=2$.;math.DS
1801.04550;Properties of non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials at $q=1$ and $q=0$;We examine the non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials $E_\lambda(x,q,t)$ at $q=1$, as well as the more general permuted-basement Macdonald polynomials. When $q=1$, we show that $E_\lambda(x,1,t)$ is symmetric and independent of $t$ whenever $\lambda$ is a partition. Furthermore, we show that for general $\lambda$, this expression factors into a symmetric and a non-symmetric part, where the symmetric part is independent of $t$, while the non-symmetric part only depends on the relative order of the entries in $\lambda$. <br />We also examine the case $q=0$, which give rise to so called permuted-basement $t$-atoms. We prove expansion-properties of these, and as a corollary, prove that Demazure characters (key polynomials) expand positively into permuted-basement atoms. This complements the result that permuted-basement atoms are atom-positive. Finally, we show that a product of a permuted-basement atom and a Schur polynomial is again positive in the same permuted-basement atom basis, and thus interpolates between two results by Haglund, Luoto, Mason and van Willigenburg. <br />The common theme in this project is the application of basement-permuting operators as well as combinatorics on fillings, by applying results in a previous article by the first author.;math.CO
1801.04551;On Congruence Permutable $G$-sets;An algebraic structure is said to be congruence permutable if its arbitrary congruences $\alpha$ and $\beta$ satisfy the equation $\alpha \circ \beta =\beta \circ \alpha$, where $\circ$ denotes the usual composition of binary relations. For an arbitrary $G$-set $X$ with $G\cap X=\emptyset$, we define a semigroup $(G,X,0)$ with a zero $0$ ($0\notin G\cup X$), and give necessary and sufficient conditions for the congruence permutability of the $G$-set $X$ by the help of the semigroup $(G,X,0)$.;math.GR
1801.04552;Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation in NOMA Heterogeneous Networks;Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has attracted much recent attention owing to its capability for improving the system spectral efficiency in wireless communications. Deploying NOMA in heterogeneous network can satisfy users' explosive data traffic requirements, and NOMA will likely play an important role in the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication networks. However, NOMA brings new technical challenges on resource allocation due to the mutual cross-tier interference in heterogeneous networks. In this article, to study the tradeoff between data rate performance and energy consumption in NOMA, we examine the problem of energy-efficient user scheduling and power optimization in 5G NOMA heterogeneous networks. The energy-efficient user scheduling and power allocation schemes are introduced for the downlink 5G NOMA heterogeneous network for perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) respectively. Simulation results show that the resource allocation schemes can significantly increase the energy efficiency of 5G NOMA heterogeneous network for both cases of perfect CSI and imperfect CSI.;cs.IT
1801.04555;Remarks on Graphons;The notion of the graphon (a symmetric measurable fuzzy set of $[0, 1]^2$) was introduced by L. Lov\'asz and B. Szegedy in 2006 to describe limit objects of convergent sequences of dense graphs. In their investigation the integral \[t(F,W)=\int _{[0, 1]^k}\prod _{ij\in E(F)}W(x_i,x_j)dx_1dx_2\cdots dx_k\] plays an important role in which $W$ is a graphon and $E(F)$ denotes the set of all edges of a $k$-labelled simple graph $F$. In our present paper we show that the set of all fuzzy sets of $[0, 1]^2$ is a right regular band with respect to the operation $\circ$ defined by \[(f\circ g)(s,t)=\vee _{(x,y)\in [0, 1]^2}(f(x,y)\wedge g(s,t)),\quad (s, t)\in [0, 1]^2,\] and the set of all graphons is a left ideal of this band. We prove that, if $W$ is an arbitrary graphon and $f$ is a fuzzy set of $[0, 1]^2$, then \[|t(F, W)-t(F, f\circ W)|\leq |E(F)|(\sup(W)-\sup(f))\Delta (\{W&gt, \sup(f)\} )\] for arbitrary finite simple graphs $F$, where $\Delta (\{W&gt, \sup(f)\})$ denotes the area of the set $\{W&gt,\sup(f)\}$ of all $(x, y)\in [0, 1]^2$ satisfying $W(x,y)&gt,\sup(f)$.;math.CO
1801.04556;Poisson Cox Point Processes for Vehicular Networks;This paper analyzes statistical properties of the Poisson line Cox point process useful in the modeling of vehicular networks. The point process is created by a two-stage construction: a Poisson line process to model road infrastructure and independent Poisson point processes, conditionally on the Poisson lines, to model vehicles on the roads. We derive basic properties of the point process, including the general quadratic position of the points, the nearest distance distribution, the Laplace functional, the densities of facets of the Cox-Voronoi tessellation, and the asymptotic behavior of the typical Voronoi cell under vehicular densification. These properties are closely linked to features that are important in vehicular networks.;cs.IT
1801.04558;On the effect of blockage objects in dense MIMO SWIPT networks;Simultaneous information and power transfer (SWIPT) is characterised by the ambiguous role of multi-user interference. In short, the beneficial effect of multi-user interference on RF energy harvesting is obtained at the price of a reduced link capacity, thus originating nontrivial trade-offs between the achievable information rate and the harvestable energy. Arguably, in indoor environments, this trade-off might be affected by the propagation loss due to blockage objects like walls. Hence, a couple of fundamental questions arise. How much must the network elements be densified to counteract the blockage attenuation? Is blockage always detrimental on the achievable rate-energy trade-off? In this paper, we analyse the performance of an indoor multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) SWIPT-enabled network in the attempt to shed a light of those questions. The effects of the obstacles are examined with the help of a stochastic approach in which energy transmitters (also referred to as power heads) are located by using a Poisson Point Process and walls are generated through a Manhattan Poisson Line Process. The stochastic behaviour of the signal attenuation and the multi-user interference is studied to obtain the Joint Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (J-CCDF) of information rate and harvested power. Theoretical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Eventually, the rate-energy trade-off is presented as a function of the frequency of walls to emphasise the cross-dependences between the deployment of the network elements and the topology of the venue.;cs.IT
1801.04559;Asymptotic Enumeration of Graph Classes with Many Components;We consider graph classes $\mathcal G$ in which every graph has components in a class $\mathcal{C}$ of connected graphs. We provide a framework for the asymptotic study of $\lvert\mathcal{G}_{n,N}\rvert$, the number of graphs in $\mathcal{G}$ with $n$ vertices and $N:=\lfloor\lambda n\rfloor$ components, where $\lambda\in(0,1)$. Assuming that the number of graphs with $n$ vertices in $\mathcal{C}$ satisfies \begin{align*} \lvert \mathcal{C}_n\rvert\sim b n^{-(1+\alpha)}\rho^{-n}n!, \quad n\to \infty \end{align*} for some $b,\rho&gt,0$ and $\alpha&gt,1$ -- a property commonly encountered in graph enumeration -- we show that \begin{align*} \lvert\mathcal{G}_{n,N}\rvert\sim c(\lambda) n^{f(\lambda)} (\log n)^{g(\lambda)} \rho^{-n}h(\lambda)^{N}\frac{n!}{N!}, \quad n\to \infty \end{align*} for explicitly given $c(\lambda),f(\lambda),g(\lambda)$ and $h(\lambda)$. These functions are piecewise continuous with a discontinuity at a critical value $\lambda^{*}$, which we also determine. The central idea in our approach is to sample objects of $\cal G$ randomly by so-called Boltzmann generators in order to translate enumerative problems to the analysis of iid random variables. By that we are able to exploit local limit theorems and large deviation results well-known from probability theory to prove our claims. The main results are formulated for generic combinatorial classes satisfying the SET-construction.;math.CO

1801.04561;Regular orbits of sporadic simple groups;Given a finite group $G$ and a faithful irreducible $FG$-module $V$ where $F$ has prime order, does $G$ have a regular orbit on $V$? This problem is equivalent to determining which primitive permutation groups of affine type have a base of size 2. Let $G$ be a covering group of an almost simple group whose socle $T$ is sporadic, and let $V$ be a faithful irreducible $FG$-module where $F$ has prime order dividing $|G|$. We classify the pairs $(G,V)$ for which $G$ has no regular orbit on $V$, and determine the minimal base size of $G$ in its action on $V$. To obtain this classification, for each non-trivial $g\in G/Z(G)$, we compute the minimal number of $T$-conjugates of $g$ generating $\langle T,g\rangle$.;math.RT

For symmetric banded matrices these novel approximations provide a computable reconstruction of the associated matrix function which exhibits decaying properties comparable to the best existing theoretical bounds. Numerical examples show the benefits of the proposed rational approximations w.r.t. the classical Taylor polynomials.;math.NA

1801.04578;Fixed angle scattering: recovery of singularities and its limitations;We prove that in dimension $n \ge 2$ the main singularities of a complex potential $q$ having a certain a priori regularity are contained in the Born approximation $q_\theta$ constructed from fixed angle scattering data. Moreover, ${q-q_\theta}$ can be up to one derivative more regular than $q$ in the Sobolev scale. In fact, this result is optimal, we construct a family of compactly supported and radial potentials for which it is not possible to have more than one derivative gain. Also, these functions show that for $n&gt,3$, the maximum derivative gain can be very small for potentials in the Sobolev scale not having a certain a priori level of regularity which grows with the dimension.;math.AP
1801.04579;Hadamard Star Configurations;Bocci, Carlini, and Kileel have shown that the square-free Hadamard product of a finite set of points $Z$ that all lie on a line $\ell$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$ produces a star configuration of codimension $n$. In this paper we introduce a construction using the Hadamard product to construct star configurations of codimension $c$. In the case that $c = n= 2$, our construction produces the star configurations of Bocci, Carlini, and Kileel. We will call any star configuration that can be constructed using our approach a Hadamard star configuration. Our main result is a classification of Hadamard star configurations.;math.AG

1801.04584;The method of hypergraph containers;In this survey we describe a recently-developed technique for bounding the number (and controlling the typical structure) of finite objects with forbidden substructures. This technique exploits a subtle clustering phenomenon exhibited by the independent sets of uniform hypergraphs whose edges are sufficiently evenly distributed, more precisely, it provides a relatively small family of 'containers' for the independent sets, each of which contains few edges. We attempt to convey to the reader a general high-level overview of the method, focusing on a small number of illustrative applications in areas such as extremal graph theory, Ramsey theory, additive combinatorics, and discrete geometry, and avoiding technical details as much as possible.;math.CO

Brezis and H.-M. Nguyen in a recent paper. These functionals Gamma-converge to a multiple of the Sobolev norm or the total variation, depending on a summability exponent, but the exact values of the constants are unknown in many cases. <br />We describe a new approach to the Gamma-convergence result that leads in some special cases to the exact value of the constants, and to the existence of smooth recovery families.;math.FA
1801.04593;On Identifying a Massive Number of Distributions;Finding the underlying probability distributions of a set of observed sequences under the constraint that each sequence is generated i.i.d by a distinct distribution is considered. The number of distributions, and hence the number of observed sequences, are let to grow with the observation blocklength $n$. Asymptotically matching upper and lower bounds on the probability of error are derived.;cs.IT
1801.04595;Engel elements in some fractal groups;Let $p$ be a prime and let $G$ be a subgroup of a Sylow pro-$p$ subgroup of the group of automorphisms of the $p$-adic tree. We prove that if $G$ is fractal and $|G':\mathrm{st}_G(1)'|=\infty$, then the set $L(G)$ of left Engel elements of $G$ is trivial. This result applies to fractal nonabelian groups with torsion-free abelianization, for example the Basilica group, the Brunner-Sidki-Vieira group, and also to the GGS-group with constant defining vector. <br />We further provide two examples showing that neither of the requirements $|G':\mathrm{st}_G(1)'|=\infty$ and being fractal can be dropped.;math.GR
1801.04596;Stochastic quantization of an Abelian gauge theory;We study the Langevin dynamics of a U(1) lattice gauge theory on the torus, and prove that they converge for short time in a suitable gauge to a system of stochastic PDEs driven by space-time white noises. This also yields convergence of some gauge invariant observables on a short time interval. We fix gauge via a DeTurck trick, and prove a version of Ward identity which results in cancellation of renormalization constants that would otherwise break gauge symmetry. The proof relies on a discrete version of the theory of regularity structures.;math.PR
1801.04599;The modal logic of arithmetic potentialism and the universal algorithm;I investigate the modal commitments of various conceptions of the philosophy of arithmetic potentialism. Specifically, I consider the natural potentialist systems arising from the models of arithmetic under their natural extension concepts, such as end-extensions, arbitrary extensions, conservative extensions and more. In these potentialist systems, I show, the propositional modal assertions that are valid with respect to all arithmetic assertions with parameters are exactly the assertions of S4. With respect to sentences, however, the validities of a model lie between S4 and S5, and these bounds are sharp in that there are models realizing both endpoints. For a model of arithmetic to validate S5 is precisely to fulfill the arithmetic maximality principle, which asserts that every possibly necessary statement is already true, and these models are equivalently characterized as those satisfying a maximal $\Sigma_1$ theory. The main S4 analysis makes fundamental use of the universal algorithm, of which this article provides a simplified, self-contained account. The paper concludes with a discussion of how the philosophical differences of several fundamentally different potentialist attitudes---linear inevitability, convergent potentialism and radical branching possibility---are expressed by their corresponding potentialist modal validities.;math.LO
1801.04605;Tribonacci numbers and primes of the form $p=x^2+11y^2$;In this paper we show that for any prime number $p$ not equal to $11$ or $19$, the Tribonacci number $T_{p-1}$ is divisible by $p$ if and only if $p$ is of the form $x^2+11y^2$. We first use class field theory on the Galois closure of the number field corresponding to the polynomial $x^3-x^2-x-1$ to give the splitting behavior of primes in this number field. After that, we apply these results to the explicit exponential formula for $T_{p-1}$. We also give a connection between the Tribonacci numbers and the Fourier coefficients of the unique newform of weight $2$ and level $11$.;math.NT
1801.04606;A functional limit theorem for the profile of random recursive trees;Let $X_n(k)$ be the number of vertices at level $k$ in a random recursive tree with $n+1$ vertices. We prove a functional limit theorem for the vector-valued process $(X_{[n^t]}(1),\ldots, X_{[n^t]}(k))_{t\geq 0}$, for each $k\in\mathbb N$. We show that after proper centering and normalization, this process converges weakly to a vector-valued Gaussian process whose components are integrated Brownian motions. This result is deduced from a functional limit theorem for Crump-Mode-Jagers branching processes generated by increasing random walks with increments that have finite second moment.;math.PR
1801.04611;On Newton-Okounkov bodies of Graded Linear Series;We generalize the theory of Newton-Okounkov bodies of big divisors to the case of graded linear series. One of the results is the generalization of slice formulas and the existence of generic Newton-Okounkov bodies for birational graded linear series. We also give a characterization of graded linear series which have full volume in terms of their base locus.;math.AG
1801.04612;The inverse spectral problem for periodic conservative multi-peakon solutions of the Camassa-Holm equation;We solve the inverse spectral problem associated with periodic conservative multi-peakon solutions of the Camassa-Holm equation. The corresponding isospectral sets can be identified with finite dimensional tori.;math.SP
1801.04614;Some Generalizations of Good Integers and Their Applications in the Study of Self-Dual Negacyclic Codes;Good integers introduced in 1997 form an interesting family of integers that has been continuously studied due to their rich number theoretical properties and wide applications. In this paper, we have focused on classes of $2^\beta$-good integers, $2^\beta$-oddly-good integers, and $2^\beta$-evenly-good integers which are generalizations of good integers. Properties of such integers have been given as well as their applications in characterizing and enumerating self-dual negacyclic codes over finite fields. An alternative proof for the characterization of the existence of a self-dual negacyclic code over finite fields has been given in terms of such generalized good integers. A general enumeration formula for the number of self-dual negacyclic codes of length $n$ over finite fields has been established. For some specific lengths, explicit formulas have been provided as well. Some known results on self-dual negacyclic codes over finite fields can be formalized and viewed as special cases of this work.;cs.IT
1801.04617;Some remarks on biased recursive trees;The purpose of this paper is to analyze certain statistics of a recently introduced non-uniform random tree model, biased recursive trees. This model is based on constructing a random tree by establishing a correspondence with non-uniform permutations, biased riffle shuffles. The statistics that are treated include the number of nodes with a given number of descendants, the depth of the tree, and the number of branches. The model yields the uniform recursive trees as a certain limit, some new results for the uniform case are obtained as well.;math.PR
1801.04621;Computing Shape DNA using the closest point method;We demonstrate an application of the closest point method where the truncated spectrum of the Laplace--Beltrami operator of an object is used to identify the object. The effectiveness of the method is analyzed as well as the default algorithm, `eigs', in MATLAB which computes the eigenvalues of a given matrix. We also cluster "similar" objects via multi-dimensional scaling algorithm and empirically measure its effectiveness.;math.NA
1801.04625;On difference operators for symmetric Krall-Hahn polynomials;The problem of finding measures whose orthogonal polynomials are also eigenfunctions of higher-order difference operators have been recently solved by multiplying the classical discrete measures by suitable polynomials. This problem was raised by Richard Askey in 1991. The case of the Hahn family is specially rich due to the number of parameters involved. These suitable polynomials are in the Hahn case generated from a quartet $F_1,F_2,F_3$ and $F_4$ of finite sets of positive integers. In this paper, we show that the order of the corresponding difference operators can be reduced by assuming certain symmetries on both, the parameters of the Krall-Hahn family and the associated quartet $F_1,F_2,F_3$ and $F_4$.;math.CA
1801.04626;On a discriminant knot group problem of Brieskorn;Quite some time ago, at the singularity conference at Carg\`ese 1972 Brieskorn asked the following question: <br />Is the local fundamental group $\pi_1^{s}(S-D)$ of the discriminant complement inside the semi-universal unfolding $S$ of an isolated hypersurface singularity constant for $s$ in the $\mu$-constant stratum $\Sigma_E$? <br />We review this question and give an affirmative answer in case of singular plane curve germs of multiplicity at most $3$.;math.AG
1801.04632;On symmetric matrices associated with oriented link diagrams;Let $D$ be an oriented link diagram with the set of regions $\operatorname{r}_{D}$. We define a symmetric map (or matrix) $\operatorname{\tau}_{D}\colon\operatorname{r}_{D}\times \operatorname{r}_{D} \to \mathbb{Z}[x]$ that gives rise to an invariant of oriented links, based on a slightly modified $S$-equivalence of Trotter and Murasugi in the space of symmetric matrices. In particular, for real $x$, the negative signature of $\operatorname{\tau}_{D}$ corrected by the writhe is conjecturally twice the Tristram--Levine signature function, where $2x=\sqrt{t}+\frac1{\sqrt{t}}$ with $t$ being the indeterminate of the Alexander polynomial.;math.GT
1801.04633;Chain level loop bracket and pseudo-holomorphic disks;Let $L$ be a Lagrangian submanifold in a symplectic vector space which is closed, oriented and spin. Using virtual fundamental chains of moduli spaces of nonconstant pseudo-holomorphic disks with boundaries on $L$, one can define a Maurer-Cartan element of a Lie bracket operation in string topology (the loop bracket) defined at chain level. This observation is due to Fukaya, who also pointed out its important consequences in symplectic topology. The goal of this paper is to work out details of this observation. Our argument is based on a string topology chain model previously introduced by the author, and the theory of Kuranishi structures on moduli spaces of pseudo-holomorphic disks, which has been developed by Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono.;math.SG
1801.04634;Integration Order Replacement Technique for Iterated Ito Stochastic Integrals and Iterated Stochastic Integrals With Respect to Martingales;The article is devoted to the integration order replacement technique for iterated Ito stochastic integrals and iterated stochastic integrals with respect to martingales. We consider the class of iterated Ito stochastic integrals, for which with probability 1 the formulas of integration order replacement corresponding to the rules of classical integral calculus are reasonable. The theorems on integration order replacement for the class of iterated Ito stochastic integrals is proven. Many examples of this theorems usage have been considered. These results are generalized for the class of iterated stochastic integrals with respect to martingales.;math.PR
1801.04636;Phase Transitions on the Markov and Lagrange Dynamical Spectra;The Markov and Lagrange dynamical spectra, was introduced by Moreira and share several geometric and topological aspects with the classical ones. However, some features of generic dynamical spectra associated to hyperbolic sets can be proved in the dynamical case and we do not know if they are true in classical case. They can be a good source of natural conjectures about the classical spectra: it is natural to conjecture that some properties which hold for generic dynamical spectra associated to hyperbolic maps also holds for the classical Markov and Lagrange spectra. In this paper, we show that, for generic dynamical spectra associated to horseshoes, there is a transition point a in the spectra such that for any $\delta &gt, 0$, the intersection of the spectra with $(a-\delta, a)$ is a countable union of Cantor sets with Hausdorff dimension smaller than 1, while the intersection of the spectra with $(a, a + \delta)$ have non-empty interior. This is still open for the classical Markov and Lagrange spectra.;math.DS
1801.04638;Pointlike sets for varieties determined by groups;For a variety of finite groups $\mathbf H$, let $\overline{\mathbf H}$ denote the variety of finite semigroups all of whose subgroups lie in $\mathbf H$. We give a characterization of the subsets of a finite semigroup that are pointlike with respect to $\overline{\mathbf H}$. Our characterization is effective whenever $\mathbf H$ has a decidable membership problem. In particular, the separation problem for $\overline{\mathbf H}$-languages is decidable for any decidable variety of finite groups $\mathbf H$. This generalizes Henckell's theorem on decidability of aperiodic pointlikes.;math.GR
1801.04639;An Elementary Dyadic Riemann Hypothesis;The connection zeta function of a finite abstract simplicial complex G is defined as zeta_L(s)=sum_x 1/lambda_x^s, where lambda_x are the eigenvalues of the connection Laplacian L defined by L(x,y)=1 if x and y intersect and 0 else. (I) As a consequence of the spectral formula chi(G)=sum_x (-1)^dim(x) = p(G)-n(G), where p(G) is the number of positive eigenvalues and n(G) is the number of negative eigenvalues of L, both the Euler characteristic chi(G)=zeta(0)-2 i zeta'(0)/pi as well as determinant det(L)=e^zeta'(0)/pi can be written in terms of zeta. (II) As a consequence of the generalized Cauchy-Binet formula for the coefficients of the characteristic polynomials of a product of matrices we show that for every one-dimensional simplicial complex G, the functional equation zeta(s)=zeta(-s) holds, where zeta(s) is the Zeta function of the positive definite squared connection operator L^2 of G. Equivalently, the spectrum sigma of the integer matrix L^2 for a 1-dimensional complex always satisfies the symmetry sigma = 1/sigma and the characteristic polynomial of L^2 is palindromic. The functional equation extends to products of one-dimensional complexes. (III) Explicit expressions for the spectrum of circular connection Laplacian lead to an explicit entire zeta function in the Barycentric limit. The situation is simpler than in the Hodge Laplacian H=D^2 case where no functional equation was available. In the connection Laplacian case, the limiting zeta function is a generalized hypergeometric function which for an integer s is given by an elliptic integral over the real elliptic curve w^2=(1+z)(1-z)(z^2-4z-1), which has the analytic involutive symmetry (z,w) to (1/z,w/z^2).;math.CO
1801.04643;Generalized Lambert Series Identities and Applications in Rank Differences;In this article, we prove two identities of generalized Lambert series. By introducing what we call $\mathcal{S}$-series, we establish relationships between multiple generalized Lambert series and multiple infinite products. Compared with Chan's work, these new identities are useful in generating various formulas for generalized Lambert series with the same poles. Using these formulas, we study the 3-dissection properties of ranks for overpartitions modulo 6. In this case, $-1$ appears as a unit root, so that double poles occur. We also relate these ranks to the third order mock theta functions $\omega(q)$ and $\rho(q)$;math.CO
1801.04645;Renewal in Hawkes processes with self-excitation and inhibition;This paper investigates Hawkes processes on the positive real line exhibiting both self-excitation and inhibition. Each point of this point process impacts its future intensity by the addition of a signed reproduction function. The case of a nonnegative reproduction function corresponds to self-excitation, and has been widely investigated in the literature. In particular, there exists a cluster representation of the Hawkes process which allows to apply results known for Galton-Watson trees. In the present paper, we establish limit theorems for Hawkes process with signed reproduction functions by using renewal techniques. We notably prove exponential concentration inequalities, and thus extend results of Reynaud-Bouret and Roy (2007) which were proved for nonnegative reproduction functions using this cluster representation which is no longer valid in our case. An important step for this is to establish the existence of exponential moments for renewal times of M/G/infinity queues that appear naturally in our problem. These results have their own interest, independently of the original problem for the Hawkes processes.;math.PR
1801.04650;Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access For Cooperative Communications: Challenges, Opportunities, And Trends;Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising radio access technique for next-generation wireless networks. In this article, we investigate the NOMA-based cooperative relay network. We begin with an introduction of the existing relay-assisted NOMA systems by classifying them into three categories: uplink, downlink, and composite architectures. Then, we discuss their principles and key features, and provide a comprehensive comparison from the perspective of spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and total transmit power. A novel strategy termed hybrid power allocation is further discussed for the composite architecture, which can reduce the computational complexity and signaling overhead at the expense of marginal sum rate degradation. Finally, major challenges, opportunities, and future research trends for the design of NOMA-based cooperative relay systems with other techniques are also highlighted to provide insights for researchers in this field.;cs.IT
1801.04653;Dimension reduction for slow-fast, piecewise-smooth, continuous systems of ODEs;The limiting slow dynamics of slow-fast, piecewise-linear, continuous systems of ODEs occurs on critical manifolds that are piecewise-linear. At points of non-differentiability, such manifolds are not normally hyperbolic and so the fundamental results of geometric singular perturbation theory do not apply. In this paper it is shown that if the critical manifold is globally stable then the system is forward invariant in a neighbourhood of the critical manifold. It follows that in this neighbourhood the dynamics is given by a regular perturbation of the dynamics on the critical manifold and so dimension reduction can be achieved. If the attraction is instead non-global, additional dynamics involving canards may be generated. For boundary equilibrium bifurcations of piecewise-smooth, continuous systems, the results are used to establish a general methodology by which such bifurcations can be analysed. This approach is illustrated with a three-dimensional model of ocean circulation.;math.DS
1801.04658;Information Geometric Approach to Bayesian Lower Error Bounds;Information geometry describes a framework where probability densities can be viewed as differential geometry structures. This approach has shown that the geometry in the space of probability distributions that are parameterized by their covariance matrix is linked to the fundamentals concepts of estimation theory. In particular, prior work proposes a Riemannian metric - the distance between the parameterized probability distributions - that is equivalent to the Fisher Information Matrix, and helpful in obtaining the deterministic Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Recent work in this framework has led to establishing links with several practical applications. However, classical CRLB is useful only for unbiased estimators and inaccurately predicts the mean square error in low signal-to-noise (SNR) scenarios. In this paper, we propose a general Riemannian metric that, at once, is used to obtain both Bayesian CRLB and deterministic CRLB along with their vector parameter extensions. We also extend our results to the Barankin bound, thereby enhancing their applicability to low SNR situations.;cs.IT
1801.04659;The Circular Law for Random Matrices with Intra-row Dependence;We consider the problem of determining the limiting spectral distribution for random matrices whose row distributions are permitted to have limited dependence. We assume mild moment conditions and give an extension of the Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur theorem for this context. The main new feature here are geometric conditions on the distributions which allow us to extend the circular law to this setting.;math.PR
1801.04665;A nonlocal shallow-water model arising from the full water waves with the Coriolis effect;In the present study a mathematical model of long-crested water waves propagating mainly in one direction with the effect of Earth's rotation is derived by following the formal asymptotic procedures. Such a model equation is analogous to the Camassa-Holm approximation of the two-dimensional incompressible and irrotational Euler equations and has a formal bi-Hamiltonian structure. Its solution corresponding to physically relevant initial perturbations is more accurate on a much longer time scale. It is shown that the deviation of the free surface can be determined by the horizontal velocity at a certain depth in the second-order approximation. The effects of the Coriolis force caused by the Earth rotation and nonlocal higher nonlinearities on blow-up criteria and wave-breaking phenomena are also investigated. Our refined analysis is approached by applying the method of characteristics and conserved quantities to the Riccati-type differential inequality.;math.AP
1801.04666;On a shallow-water approximation to the Green-Naghdi equations with the Coriolis effect;We consider an asymptotic 1D (in space) rotation-Camassa-Holm (R-CH) model, which could be used to describe the propagation of long-crested shallow-water waves in the equatorial ocean regions with allowance for the weak Coriolis effect due to the Earth's rotation. This model equation has similar wave-breaking phenomena as the Camassa-Holm equation. It is analogous to the rotation-Green-Naghdi (R-GN) equations with the weak Earth's rotation effect, modeling the propagation of wave allowing large amplitude in shallow water. We provide here a rigorous justification showing that solutions of the R-GN equations tend to associated solution of the R-CH model equation in the Camassa-Holm regime with the small amplitude and the larger wavelength. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the R-GN model equations are locally well-posed in a Sobolev space by the refined energy estimates.;math.AP
1801.04668;The decoding failure probability of MDPC codes;Moderate Density Parity Check (MDPC) codes are defined here as codes which have a parity-check matrix whose row weight is $O(\sqrt{n})$ where $n$ is the length $n$ of the code. They can be decoded like LDPC codes but they decode much less errors than LDPC codes: the number of errors they can decode in this case is of order $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$. Despite this fact they have been proved very useful in cryptography for devising key exchange mechanisms. They have also been proposed in McEliece type cryptosystems. However in this case, the parameters that have been proposed in \cite{MTSB13} were broken in \cite{GJS16}. This attack exploits the fact that the decoding failure probability is non-negligible. We show here that this attack can be thwarted by choosing the parameters in a more conservative way. We first show that such codes can decode with a simple bit-flipping decoder any pattern of $O\left(\frac{\sqrt{n} \log \log n}{\log n}\right)$ errors. This avoids the previous attack at the cost of significantly increasing the key size of the scheme. We then show that under a very reasonable assumption the decoding failure probability decays almost exponentially with the codelength with just two iterations of bit-flipping. With an additional assumption it has even been proved that it decays exponentially with an unbounded number of iterations and we show that in this case the increase of the key size which is required for resisting to the attack of \cite{GJS16} is only moderate.;cs.IT
1801.04673;Partial geodesics on symmetric groups endowed with breakpoint distance;The notion of partial geodesic was introduced by Jamshidpey et al. in "Sets of medians in the non-geodesic pseudometric space of unsigned genomes with breakpoints", 2014. In this paper, we study the density of points on non-trivial partial geodesics between two permutations $\xi_1^{(n)}$ and $\xi_2^{(n)}$ chosen uniformly and independently at random from the symmetric group $S_n$, where $S_n$ is endowed with the breakpoint distance. For a permutation $\pi := \pi_1 \ ... \ \pi_n$, any unordered pair $\{\pi_i , \pi_{i+1}\}$, for $i=1, ..., n-1$, is called an adjacency of $\pi$. The set of all adjacencies of $\pi$ is denoted by $\mathcal{A}_\pi$. Denote by $id^{(n)}$ the identity permutation, and let $I_n$ be an arbitrary subset of $\mathcal A_{id^{(n)}}$. We classify the set of all adjacencies of a permutation $\pi \in S_n$ into four types, with respect to $I_n$. Then for a permutation $\xi^{(n)}$ chosen uniformly at random from $S_n$, we derive a convergence theorem for the normalized number (after dividing by $n$) of adjacencies of each type in $\xi^{(n)}$ with respect to $I_n$ (for some random or deterministic choices of $I_n$), as $n\rightarrow \infty$. We also see an application of this convergence theorem to find the appropriate choices of $I_n$. A geodesic point of $u$ and $v$ in a pseudometric space $(S,\rho)$ is a point $w$ of the space that $\rho(u,w)+\rho(w,v)=\rho(u,v)$. We find an upper bound for the number of permutations $x\in S_n$ for which there exists at least one non-trivial geodesic point between $id^{(n)}$ and $x$, far from both. This partially verifies the conjecture of Haghighi and Sankoff stated in "Medians seek the corners, and other conjectures", 2012, namely we prove that, with high probability, there is no breakpoint median of two permutations $\xi_1^{(n)}$ and $\xi_2^{(n)}$ chosen uniformly and independently at random from $S_n$, far from both of them.;math.CO
1801.04674;Approximation of Excessive Backlog Probabilities of Two Tandem Queues;Let $X$ be the constrained random walk on ${\mathbb Z}_+^2$ taking the steps $(1,0)$, $(-1,1)$ and $(0,-1)$ with probabilities $\lambda &lt, (\mu_1\neq \mu_2)$, in particular, $X$ is assumed stable. Let $\tau_n$ be the first time $X$ hits $\partial A_n = \{x:x(1)+x(2) = n \}$ For $x \in {\mathbb Z}_+^2, x(1) + x(2) &lt, n$, the probability $p_n(x)= P_x( \tau_n &lt, \tau_0)$ is a key performance measure for the queueing system represented by $X$. Let $Y$ be the constrained random walk on ${\mathbb Z} \times {\mathbb Z}_+$ with increments $(-1,0)$, $(1,1)$ and $(0,-1)$. Let $\tau$ be the first time that the components of $Y$ equal each other. We derive the following explicit formula for $P_y(\tau &lt, \infty)$: \[ P_y(\tau &lt, \infty) = W(y)= \rho_2^{y(1)-y(2)} + \frac{\mu_2 - \lambda}{\mu_2 - \mu_1} \rho_1^{ y(1)-y(2)} \rho_1^{y(2)} + \frac{\mu_2-\lambda}{\mu_1 -\mu_2} \rho_2^{y(1)-y(2)} \rho_1^{y(2)}, \] where, $\rho_i = \lambda/\mu_i$, $i=1,2$, $y \in {\mathbb Z}\times{ \mathbb Z}_+$, $y(1) &gt, y(2)$, and show that $W(n-x_n(1),x_n(2))$ approximates $p_n(x_n)$ with relative error {\em exponentially decaying} in $n$ for $x_n = \lfloor nx \rfloor$, $x \in {\mathbb R}_+^2$, $0 &lt, x(1) + x(2) &lt, 1$. The steps of our analysis: 1) with an affine transformation, move the origin $(0,0)$ to $(n,0)$ on $\partial A_n$, let $n\nearrow \infty$ to remove the constraint on the $x(2)$ axis, this step gives the limit {\em unstable} /{\em transient} constrained random walk $Y$ and reduces $P_{x}(\tau_n &lt, \tau_0)$ to $P_y(\tau &lt, \infty)$, 2) construct a basis of harmonic functions of $Y$ and use it to apply the superposition principle to compute $P_y(\tau &lt, \infty).$ The construction involves the use of conjugate points on a characteristic surface associated with the walk $X$. The proof that the relative error decays exponentially uses a sequence of subsolutions of a related HJB equation on a manifold.;math.PR
1801.04675;Efficient arithmetic regularity and removal lemmas for induced bipartite patterns;Let $G$ be an abelian group of bounded exponent and $A \subseteq G$. We show that if the collection of translates of $A$ has VC dimension at most $d$, then for every $\epsilon&gt,0$ there is a subgroup $H$ of $G$ of index at most $\epsilon^{-d-o(1)}$ such that one can add or delete at most $\epsilon|G|$ elements to/from $A$ to make it a union of $H$-cosets. <br />We also establish a removal lemma with polynomial bounds, with applications to property testing, for induced bipartite patterns in a finite abelian group with bounded exponent.;math.CO
1801.04682;Primes dividing invariants of CM Picard curves;We give a bound on the primes dividing the denominators of invariants of Picard curves of genus 3 with complex multiplication. Unlike earlier bounds in genus 2 and 3, our bound is based not on bad reduction of curves, but on a very explicit type of good reduction. This approach simultaneously yields a simplification of the proof, and much sharper bounds. In fact, unlike all previous bounds for genus 3, our bound is sharp enough for use in explicit constructions of Picard curves.;math.NT
1801.04683;The global Cauchy problem for compressible Euler equations with a nonlocal dissipation;This paper studies the global existence and uniqueness of strong solutions and its large-time behavior for the compressible isothermal Euler equations with a nonlocal dissipation. The system is rigorously derived from the kinetic Cucker-Smale flocking equation with strong local alignment forces and diffusions through the hydrodynamic limit based on the relative entropy argument. In a perturbation framework, we establish the global existence of a unique strong solution for the system under suitable smallness and regularity assumptions on the initial data. We also provide the large-time behavior of solutions showing the fluid density and the velocity converge to its averages exponentially fast as time goes to infinity.;math.AP
1801.04691;Asymptotic Correlation Structure of Discounted Incurred But Not Reported Claims under Fractional Poisson Arrival Process;This paper studies the joint moments of a compound discounted renewal process observed at different times with each arrival removed from the system after a random delay. This process can be used to describe the aggregate (discounted) Incurred But Not Reported claims in insurance and also the total number of customers in an infinite server queue. It is shown that the joint moments can be obtained recursively in terms of the renewal density, from which the covariance and correlation structures are derived. In particular, the fractional Poisson process defined via the renewal approach is also considered. Furthermore, the asymptotic behaviour of covariance and correlation coefficient of the aforementioned quantities is analyzed as the time horizon goes to infinity. Special attention is paid to the cases of exponential and Pareto delays.;math.PR
1801.04694;Incompressible inviscid resistive MHD surface waves in 2D;We consider the dynamics of a layer of an incompressible electrically conducting fluid interacting with the magnetic field in a two-dimensional horizontally periodic setting. The upper boundary is in contact with the atmosphere, and the lower boundary is a rigid flat bottom. We prove the global well-posedness of the inviscid and resistive problem with surface tension around a non-horizontal uniform magnetic field, moreover, the solution decays to the equilibrium almost exponentially. One of the key observations here is an induced damping structure for the fluid vorticity due to the resistivity and transversal magnetic field.;math.AP
1801.04696;Robust capacitated trees and networks with uniform demands;We are interested in the design of robust (or resilient) capacitated rooted Steiner networks in case of terminals with uniform demands. Formally, we are given a graph, capacity and cost functions on the edges, a root, a subset of nodes called terminals, and a bound k on the number of edge failures. We first study the problem where k = 1 and the network that we want to design must be a tree covering the root and the terminals: we give complexity results and propose models to optimize both the cost of the tree and the number of terminals disconnected from the root in the worst case of an edge failure, while respecting the capacity constraints on the edges. Second, we consider the problem of computing a minimum-cost survivable network, i.e., a network that covers the root and terminals even after the removal of any k edges, while still respecting the capacity constraints on the edges. We also consider the possibility of protecting a given number of edges. We propose three different formulations: a cut-set based formulation, a flow based one, and a bilevel one (with an attacker and a defender). We propose algorithms to solve each formulation and compare their efficiency.;math.OC
1801.04706;Inclusion-exclusion by ordering-free cancellation;Whitney's broken circuit theorem gives a graphical example to reduce the number of the terms in the sum of the inclusion-exclusion formula by a predicted cancellation. So far, the known cancellations for the formula strongly depend on the prescribed (linear or partial) ordering on the index set. We give a new cancellation method, which does not require any ordering on the index set. Our method extends all the `ordering-based' methods known in the literatures and in general reduces more terms. As examples, we use our method to improve some relevant results on graph polynomials.;math.CO
1801.04707;Preconditioning of a hybridized discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for the Stokes equations;We present optimal preconditioners for a recently introduced hybridized discontinuous Galerkin finite element discretization of the Stokes equations. Typical of hybridized discontinuous Galerkin methods, the method has degrees-of-freedom that can be eliminated locally (cell-wise), thereby significantly reducing the size of the global problem. Although the linear system becomes more complex to analyze after static condensation of these element degrees-of-freedom, the pressure Schur complement of the original and reduced problem are the same. Using this fact, we prove spectral equivalence of this Schur complement to two simple matrices, which is then used to formulate optimal preconditioners for the statically condensed problem. Numerical simulations in two and three spatial dimensions demonstrate the good performance of the proposed preconditioners.;math.NA
1801.04708;Sensitivity analysis for multiscale stochastic reaction networks using hybrid approximations;We consider the problem of estimating parameter sensitivities for stochastic models of multiscale reaction networks. These sensitivity values are important for model analysis, and, the methods that currently exist for sensitivity estimation mostly rely on simulations of the stochastic dynamics. This is problematic because these simulations become computationally infeasible for multiscale networks due to reactions firing at several different timescales. However it is often possible to exploit the multiscale property to derive a "model reduction" and approximate the dynamics as a Piecewise Deterministic Markov process (PDMP), which is a hybrid process consisting of both discrete and continuous components. The aim of this paper is to show that such PDMP approximations can be used to accurately and efficiently estimate the parameter sensitivity for the original multiscale stochastic model. We prove the convergence of the original sensitivity to the corresponding PDMP sensitivity, in the limit where the PDMP approximation becomes exact. Moreover we establish a representation of the PDMP parameter sensitivity that separates the contributions of discrete and continuous components in the dynamics, and allows one to efficiently estimate both contributions.;math.PR
1801.04711;A note on the zeros of the zeta-function of Riemann;It is shown explicitly how the sign of Hardy's function $Z(t)$ depends on the parity of the zero-counting function $N(T)$. Two existing definitions of this function are analyzed, and some related problems are discussed.;math.NT
1801.04713;Comparison of two notions of subharmonicity on non-archimedean curves;We show that a continuous function on the analytification of a smooth proper algebraic curve over a non-archimedean field is subharmonic in the sense of Thuillier if and only if it is psh, i.e. subharmonic in the sense of Chambert-Loir and Ducros. This equivalence implies that the property psh for continuous functions is stable under pullback with respect to morphisms of curves. Furthermore, we prove an analogue of the monotone regularization theorem on the analytification of the projective line and Mumford curves using this equivalence.;math.AG
1801.04717;A Note On the Exponential Diophantine Equation (a^n-1)(b^n-1)=x^2;In 2002, F. Luca and G. Walsh solved the Diophantine equation in the title for all pairs (a,b) such that 1&lt,a&lt,b&lt,101 with some exceptions. There are sixty nine exceptions. In this paper, we give some new results concerning the equation in the title. It is proved that the equation (a^n-1)(b^n-1)=x^2 has no solutions if a,b have opposite parity and n&gt,4 with 2|n. Also, we solved (a^n-1)(b^n-1)=x^2 for the pairs (a,b)=(2,50),(4,49),(12,45),(13,76),(20,77),(28,49), and (45,100). Lastly, we show that when b is even, the equation (a^n-1)(b^(2n)a^n-1)=x^2 has no solutions n,x.;math.NT
1801.04719;Parallel weight 2 points on Hilbert modular eigenvarieties and the parity conjecture;Let F be a totally real field of degree d and let p be an odd prime which is totally split in F. We define and study one-dimensional partial eigenvarieties interpolating Hilbert modular forms over F with weight varying only at a single place v above p. For these eigenvarieties, we show that methods developed by Liu, Wan and Xiao apply and deduce that, over a boundary annulus in weight space of sufficiently small radius, the partial eigenvarieties decompose as a disjoint union of components which are finite over weight space. We apply this result to prove the parity version of the Bloch--Kato conjecture for finite slope Hilbert modular forms with trivial central character (under some assumptions), by reducing to the case of parallel weight 2. As another consequence of our results on partial eigenvarieties, we show, still under the assumption that p is totally split in F, that the full (dimension 1 + d) cuspidal Hilbert modular eigenvariety has the property that many (all, if d is even) irreducible components contain a classical point with non-critical slopes and parallel weight 2 (with some character at p whose conductor can be explicitly bounded), or any other algebraic weight.;math.NT
1801.04735;Secure Adaptive Group Testing;Group Testing (GT) addresses the problem of identifying a small subset of defective items from a large population, by grouping items into as few test pools as possible. In Adaptive GT (AGT), outcomes of previous tests can influence the makeup of future tests. This scenario has been studied from an information theoretic point of view. Aldridge $2012$ showed that in the regime of a few defectives, adaptivity does not help much, as the number of tests required for identification of the set of defectives is essentially the same as for non-adaptive GT. <br />Secure GT considers a scenario where there is an eavesdropper who may observe a fraction $\delta$ of the outcomes, and should not be able to infer the status of the items. In the non-adaptive scenario, the number of tests required is $1/(1-\delta)$ times the number of tests without the secrecy constraint. <br />In this paper, we consider Secure Adaptive GT. Specifically, when an adaptive algorithm has access to a private feedback link of rate $R_f$, we prove that the number of tests required for both correct reconstruction at the legitimate user, with high probability, and negligible mutual information at the eavesdropper is $1/min\{1,1-\delta+R_f\}$ times the number of tests required with no secrecy constraint. Thus, unlike non-secure GT, where an adaptive algorithm has only a mild impact, under a security constraint it can significantly boost performance. A key insight is that not only the adaptive link should disregard test results and send keys, these keys should be enhanced through a "secret sharing" scheme before usage.;cs.IT
1801.04738;Tilting modules over Auslander-Gorenstein Algebras;For a finite dimensional algebra $\Lambda$ and a non-negative integer $n$, we characterize when the set $\tilt_n\Lambda$ of additive equivalence classes of tilting modules with projective dimension at most $n$ has a minimal (or equivalently, minimum) element. This generalize results of Happel-Unger. Moreover, for an $n$-Gorenstein algebra $\Lambda$ with $n\geq 1$, we construct a minimal element in $\tilt_{n}\Lambda$. <br />As a result, we give equivalent conditions for a $k$-Gorenstein algebra to be Iwanaga-Gorenstein. Moreover, for an $1$-Gorenstein algebra $\Lambda$ and its factor algebra $\Gamma=\Lambda/(e)$, we show that there is a bijection between $\tilt_1\Lambda$ and the set $\sttilt\Gamma$ of isomorphism classes of basic support $\tau$-tilting $\Gamma$-modules, where $e$ is an idempotent such that $e\Lambda $ is the additive generator of projective-injective $\Lambda$-modules.;math.RT
1801.04740;Interior and boundary gradient estimates for Neumann problem of fully nonlinear Hessian equations;In this paper we study the {\it a priori} gradient estimates for admissible solutions to Neumann boundary value problem of fully nonlinear Hessian equations on Riemannian manifolds.

1801.04742;Hilbert&#x27,s Error?;It is well known that a center of a given circle cannot be constructed using only a straightedge and that this was proven by David Hilbert. Still it is not so clear what kind of object is proven to be non-existing. We analyze different attempts to define a geometric construction appearing in the literature and observe that none of them is really satisfactory and that Hilbert's proof needs to be corrected (as noted by Akopyan and Fedorov);math.HO
1801.04746;A frequency approach for stabilization of one-dimensional degenerate wave equation;In this paper, we are concerned with the study of stabilization problem for the following strongly degenerate wave equation in one space dimension $$w_{tt}(x,t)-\left(x^\alpha w_x(x,t)\right)_x=0$$ where ${\bf\alpha\in [1,2)}$. Thus, using a frequency domain method inspired from \cite{BT}, we prove the polynomial decays of its total energy with $t^{-\nicefrac{1}{2}}$ decay rate.;math.AP
1801.04748;Directed Strongly Regular Cayley Graphs on Dihedral groups;In this paper,we construct some directed strongly regular Cayley graphs on dihedral groups,these generalizes some earlier constructions.We also characterize some certain directed strongly regular Cayley graphs on dihedral groups $D_{p^\alpha}$,where $p$ is a prime and $\alpha\geqslant 1$ is a positive integer.;math.CO
1801.04750;The visual boundary of hyperbolic free-by-cyclic groups;Let $\phi$ be an atoroidal outer automorphism of the free group $F_n$. We study the Gromov boundary of the hyperbolic group $G_{\phi} = F_n \rtimes_{\phi} \mathbb{Z}$. We explicitly describe a family of embeddings of the complete bipartite graph $K_{3,3}$ into $\partial G_\phi$. To do so, we define the directional Whitehead graph and prove that an indecomposable $F_n$-tree is Levitt type if and only if one of its directional Whitehead graphs contains more than one edge. As an application, we obtain a direct proof of Kapovich-Kleiner's theorem that $\partial G_\phi$ is homeomorphic to the Menger curve if the automorphism is atoroidal and fully irreducible.;math.GT
1801.04757;On the Distribution of Random Geometric Graphs;Random geometric graphs (RGGs) are commonly used to model networked systems that depend on the underlying spatial embedding. We concern ourselves with the probability distribution of an RGG, which is crucial for studying its random topology, properties (e.g., connectedness), or Shannon entropy as a measure of the graph's topological uncertainty (or information content). Moreover, the distribution is also relevant for determining average network performance or designing protocols. However, a major impediment in deducing the graph distribution is that it requires the joint probability distribution of the $n(n-1)/2$ distances between $n$ nodes randomly distributed in a bounded domain. As no such result exists in the literature, we make progress by obtaining the joint distribution of the distances between three nodes confined in a disk in $\mathbb{R}^2$. This enables the calculation of the probability distribution and entropy of a three-node graph. For arbitrary $n$, we derive a series of upper bounds on the graph entropy, in particular, the bound involving the entropy of a three-node graph is tighter than the existing bound which assumes distances are independent. Finally, we provide numerical results on graph connectedness and the tightness of the derived entropy bounds.;cs.IT
1801.04759;Hessian-information geometric formulation of Hamiltonian systems and generalized Toda&#x27,s dual transform;In this paper a class of classical Hamiltonian systems is geometrically formulated. This class is such that a Hamiltonian can be written as the sum of a kinetic energy function and a potential energy function. In addition, these energy functions are assumed strictly convex. For this class of Hamiltonian systems Hessian and information geometric formulation is given. With this formulation, a generalized Toda's dual transform is proposed, where his original transform was used in deriving his integrable lattice system. Then a relation between the generalized Toda's dual transform and the Legendre transform of a class of potential energy functions is shown. As an extension of this formulation, dissipation-less electric circuit models are also discussed in the geometric viewpoint above.;math-ph
1801.04761;A Tight Converse to the Spectral Resolution Limit via Convex Programming;It is now well understood that convex programming can be used to estimate the frequency components of a spectrally sparse signal from $2m+1$ uniform temporal measurements. It is conjectured that a phase transition on the success of the total-variation regularization occurs when the distance between the spectral components of the signal to estimate crosses $1/m$. We prove the necessity part of this conjecture by demonstrating that this regularization can fail whenever the spectral distance of the signal of interest is asymptotically equal to $1/m$.;cs.IT
1801.04765;Recent results on the Kobayashi and Green-Griffiths-Lang conjectures;The study of entire holomorphic curves contained in projective algebraic varieties is intimately related to fascinating questions of geometry and number theory -- especially through the concepts of curvature and positivity which are central themes in Kodaira's contributions to mathematics. The aim of these lectures is to present recent results concerning the geometric side of the problem. The Green-Griffiths-Lang conjecture stipulates that for every projective variety $X$ of general type over~${\mathbb C}$, there exists a proper algebraic subvariety $Y$ of $X$ containing all non constant entire curves $f:{\mathbb C}\to X$. Using the formalism of directed varieties and jet bundles, we show that this assertion holds true in case $X$ satisfies a strong general type condition that is related to a certain jet-semistability property of the tangent bundle $T\_X$. It is possible to exploit similar techniques to investigate a famous conjecture of Shoshichi Kobayashi (1970), according to which a generic algebraic hypersurface of dimension $n$ and of sufficiently large degree $d\ge d\_n$ in the complex projective space $\bP^{n+1}$ is hyperbolic: in the early 2000's, Yum-Tong Siu proposed a strategy that led in 2015 to a proof based on a clever use of slanted vector fields on jet spaces, combined with Nevanlinna theory arguments. In 2016, the conjecture has been settled in a different way by Damian Brotbek, making a more direct use of Wronskian differential operators and associated multiplier ideals, shortly afterwards, Ya Deng showed how the proof could be modified to yield an explicit value of $d\_n$. We give here a short proof based on a drastic simplification of their ideas, along with a further improvement of Deng's bound, namely $d\_n=\lfloor\frac{1}{5}(en)^{2n+2}\rfloor$.;math.AG
1801.04766;A Markov theorem for generalized plat decomposition;We prove a Markov theorem for tame links in a connected closed orientable 3-manifold $M$ with respect to a plat-like representation. More precisely, given a genus $g$ Heegaard surface $\Sigma_g$ for $M$ we represent each link in $M$ as the plat closure of a braid in the surface braid group $B_{g,2n}=\pi_1(C_{2n}(\Sigma_g))$ and analyze how to translate the equivalence of links in $M$ under ambient isotopy into an algebraic equivalence in $B_{g,2n}$. First, we study the equivalence problem in $\Sigma_g\times [0,1]$, and then, to obtain the equivalence in $M$, we investigate how isotopies corresponding to "sliding" along meridian discs change the braid representative. At the end we provide explicit constructions for Heegaard genus 1 manifolds, i.e. lens spaces and $S^2\times S^1$.;math.GT
1801.04767;The k-almost Ricci solitons and contact geometry;The aim of this article is to study the k-almost Ricci soliton and k-almost gradient Ricci soliton on contact metric manifold. First, we prove that if a compact K-contact metric is a k-almost gradient Ricci soliton then it is isometric to a unit sphere S2n+1. Next, we extend this result on a compact k-almost Ricci soliton when the flow vector field X is contact. Finally, we study some special types of k-almost Ricci soliton where the potential vector field X is point wise collinear with the Reeb vector field {\xi} of the contact metric structure.;math.DG
1801.04769;Nonlocal Representation of the $sl(2,R)$ Algebra for the Chazy equation;A demonstration of how the point symmetries of the Chazy Equation become nonlocal symmetries for the reduced equation is discussed. Moreover we construct an equivalent third-order differential equation which is related to the Chazy Equation under a generalized transformation, and find the point symmetries of the Chazy Equation are generalized symmetries for the new equation. With the use of singularity analysis and a simple coordinate transformation we construct a solution for the Chazy Equation which is given by a Right Painlev\'e Series. The singularity analysis is applied to the new third-order equation and we find that it admits two solutions, one given by a Left Painlev\'e Series and one given by a Right Painlev\'e Series where the leading-order behaviors and the resonances are explicitly those of the Chazy Equation.;math.CA
1801.04770;On the Exponential Diophantine Equation $(a^2-2)(b^2-2)=x^2$;In this paper, we consider the equation $(a^n-2^{m})(b^n-2^{m})=x^2$. By assuming the abc conjecture is true, in [8], Luca and Walsh gave a theorem, which implies that the above equation has only finitely many solutions $n,x$ if a and b are different fixed positive integers. We solve the above equation when $m=1$ and $(a,b)=(2,10),(4,100),(10,58),(3,45)$. Moreover, we show that $(a^2-2)(b^2-2)=x^2$ has no solution n,x if 2|n and gcd$(a,b)=1$. We also give a conjecture which says that the equation $(2^2-2)((2P_k)^n-2)=x^2$ has only the solution $(n,x)=(2,Q_k)$, where $k&gt,3$ is odd and $P_k,Q_k$ are Pell and Pell Lucas numbers, respectively. We also conjecture that if the equation $(a^2-2)(b^2-2)=x^2$ has a solution $n,x$, then $n&lt,7$, where $2&lt,a&lt,b$.;math.NT
1801.04773;Mergelyan&#x27,s and Arakelian&#x27,s theorems for manifold-valued maps;In this paper we show that Mergelyan's theorem holds for maps from open Riemann surfaces to Oka manifolds. This is used to prove the analogue of Arakelian's theorem on uniform approximation of holomorphic maps from closed subsets of the plane $\mathbb C$ to any compact complex homogeneous manifold.;math.CV
1801.04775;Two High-performance Schemes of Transmit Antenna Selection for Secure Spatial Modulation;In this paper, a secure spatial modulation (SM) system with artificial noise (AN)-aided is investigated. To achieve higher secrecy rate (SR) in such a system, two high-performance schemes of transmit antenna selection (TAS), leakage-based and maximum secrecy rate (Max-SR), are proposed and a generalized Euclidean distance-optimized antenna selection (EDAS) method is designed. From simulation results and analysis, the four TAS schemes have an decreasing order: Max-SR, leakage-based, generalized EDAS, and random (conventional), in terms of SR performance. However, the proposed Max-SR method requires the exhaustive search to achieve the optimal SR performance, thus its complexity is extremely high as the number of antennas tends to medium and large scale. The proposed leakage-based method approaches the Max-SR method with much lower complexity. Thus, it achieves a good balance between complexity and SR performance. In terms of bit error rate (BER), their performances are in an increasing order: random, leakage-based, Max-SR, and generalized EDAS.;cs.IT
1801.04776;The adic tame site;For every adic space $Z$ we construct a site $Z_t$, the tame site of $Z$. For a scheme $X$ over a base scheme $S$ we obtain a tame site by associating with $X/S$ an adic space $\textit{Spa}(X,S)$ and considering the tame site $\textit{Spa}(X,S)_t$. We examine the connection of the cohomology of the tame site with \'etale cohomology and compare its fundamental group with the conventional tame fundamental group. Finally, assuming resolution of singularities, for a regular scheme $X$ over a base scheme $S$ of characteristic $p &gt, 0$ we prove a cohomological purity theorem for the constant sheaf $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ on $\textit{Spa}(X,S)_t$. As a corollary we obtain homotopy invariance for the tame cohomology groups of $\textit{Spa}(X,S)$.;math.AG
1801.04782;Block-coordinate primal-dual method for the nonsmooth minimization over linear constraints;We consider the problem of minimizing a convex, separable, nonsmooth function subject to linear constraints. The numerical method we propose is a block-coordinate extension of the Chambolle-Pock primal-dual algorithm. We prove convergence of the method without resorting to assumptions like smoothness or strong convexity of the objective, full-rank condition on the matrix, strong duality or even consistency of the linear system. Freedom from imposing the latter assumption permits convergence guarantees for misspecified or noisy systems.;math.OC
1801.04783;Subpolynomial trace reconstruction for random strings and arbitrary deletion probability;The insertion-deletion channel takes as input a bit string ${\bf x}\in\{0,1\}^{n}$, and outputs a string where bits have been deleted and inserted independently at random. The trace reconstruction problem is to recover $\bf x$ from many independent outputs (called "traces") of the insertion-deletion channel applied to $\bf x$. We show that if $\bf x$ is chosen uniformly at random, then $\exp(O(\log^{1/3} n))$ traces suffice to reconstruct $\bf x$ with high probability. For the deletion channel with deletion probability $q &lt, 1/2$ the earlier upper bound was $\exp(O(\log^{1/2} n))$. The case of $q\geq 1/2$ or the case where insertions are allowed has not been previously analyzed, and therefore the earlier upper bound was as for worst-case strings, i.e., $\exp(O( n^{1/3}))$. We also show that our reconstruction algorithm runs in $n^{1+o(1)}$ time. <br />A key ingredient in our proof is a delicate two-step alignment procedure where we estimate the location in each trace corresponding to a given bit of $\bf x$. The alignment is done by viewing the strings as random walks and comparing the increments in the walk associated with the input string and the trace, respectively.;math.PR
1801.04784;Triviality properties of principal bundles on singular curves-II;For $G$ a split semi-simple group scheme and $P$ a principal $G$-bundle on a relative curve $X\to S$, we study a natural obstruction for the triviality of $P$ on the complement of a relatively ample Cartier divisor $D \subset X$. We show, by constructing explicit examples, that the obstruction is nontrivial if $G$ is not simply connected but it can be made to vanish, if $S$ is the spectrum of a dvr (and some other hypotheses), by a faithfully flat base change. The vanishing of this obstruction is shown to be a sufficient condition for etale local triviality if $S$ is a smooth curve, and the singular locus of $X-D$ is finite over $S$.;math.AG
1801.04790;A new relationship between the dilatation of pseudo-Anosov braids and fixed point theory;A relation between the dilatation of pseudo-Anosov braids and fixed point theory was studied by Ivanov. In this paper we reveal a new relationship between the above two subjects by showing a formula for the dilatation of pseudo-Anosov braids by means of the representations of braid groups due to B. Jiang and H. Zheng.;math.GT
1801.04791;Stability of transonic jets with strong rarefaction waves for two-dimensional steady compressible Euler system;We study supersonic flow past a convex corner which is surrounded by quiescent gas. When the pressure of the upstream supersonic flow is larger than that of the quiescent gas, there appears a strong rarefaction wave to rarefy the supersonic gas. Meanwhile, a transonic characteristic discontinuity appears to separate the supersonic flow behind the rarefaction wave from the static gas. In this paper, we employ a wave front tracking method to establish structural stability of such a flow pattern under non-smooth perturbations of the upcoming supersonic flow. It is an initial-value/free-boundary problem for the two-dimensional steady non-isentropic compressible Euler system. The main ingredients are careful analysis of wave interactions and construction of suitable Glimm functional, to overcome the difficulty that the strong rarefaction wave has a large total variation.;math.AP
1801.04793;A note for the global non-existence of semirelativistic equations with non-gauge invariant power type nonlinearity;The non-existence of global solutions for semirelativistic equations with non-gauge invariant power type nonlinearity is revisited by a relatively direct way with a pointwise estimate of fractional derivative of some test functions.;math.AP
1801.04797;A Simplicial Approach to Stratified Homotopy Theory;In this article we consider the homotopy theory of stratified spaces through a simplicial point of view. We first consider a model category of filtered simplicial sets over some fixed poset $P$, and show that it is a simplicial combinatorial model category. We then define a generalization of the homotopy groups for any fibrant filtered simplicial set $X$ : the filtered homotopy groups $s\pi_n(X)$. They are diagrams of groups built from the homotopy groups of the different pieces of $X$. We then show that the weak equivalences are exactly the morphisms that induce isomorphisms on those filtered homotopy groups. <br />Then, using filtered versions of the topological realisation of a simplicial set and of the simplicial set of singular simplices, we transfer those results to a category whose objects are topological spaces stratified over $P$. In particular, we get a stratified version of Whitehead's theorem. Specializing to the case of conically stratified spaces, a wide class of topological stratified spaces, we recover a theorem of Miller saying that to understand the homotopy type of conically stratified spaces, one only has to understand the homotopy type of strata and holinks. We then provide a family of examples of conically stratified spaces and of computations of their filtered homotopy groups.;math.AT
1801.04799;Derivation of the time dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation for a class of non purely positive potentials;We present a microscopic derivation of the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation starting from an interacting N-particle system of Bosons. We prove convergence of the reduced density matrix corresponding to the exact time evolution to the projector onto the solution of the respective Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Our work extends a previous result by one of us (P.P.[44]) to interaction potentials which need not to be nonnegative, but may have a sufficiently small negative part. One key estimate in our proof is an operator inequality which was first proven by Jun Yin, see [49].;math-ph

1801.04809;A partial order on Motzkin paths;The Tamari lattice, defined on Catalan objects such as binary trees and Dyck paths, is a well-studied poset in combinatorics. It is thus natural to try to extend it to other families of lattice paths. In this article, we fathom such a possibility by defining and studying an analogy of the Tamari lattice on Motzkin paths. While our generalization is not a lattice, each of its connected components is isomorphic to an interval in the classical Tamari lattice. With this structural result, we proceed to the enumeration of components and intervals in the poset of Motzkin paths we defined. We also extend the structural and enumerative results to Schr\"oder paths. We conclude by a discussion on the relation between our work and that of Baril and Pallo (2014).;math.CO
1801.04814;Well-posedness for scalar conservation laws with moving flux constraints;We consider a strongly coupled ODE-PDE system representing moving bottlenecks immersed in vehicular traffic. The PDE consists of a scalar conservation law modeling the traffic flow evolution and the ODE models the trajectory of a slow moving vehicle. The moving bottleneck influences the bulk traffic flow via a point flux constraint, which is given by an inequality on the flux at the slow vehicle position. We prove uniqueness and continuous dependence of solutions with respect to initial data of bounded variation. The proof is based on a new backward in time method established to capture the values of the norm of generalized tangent vectors at every time.;math.AP
1801.04817;Distributions and Euler systems for the general linear group;The main aim is to give a rigorous statement and proof of the slogan "the d-fold tensor product of distributions is an Euler system for GL_d". Of the few known examples of Euler systems, we look at those of cyclotomic units and of Beilinson-Kato elements. The cyclotomic units satisfy distribution property, and this is the key to the proof of the norm relation property for GL_1. For the Beilinson-Kato elements, the Siegel units satisfy distribution property, and the 2-fold tensor product, giving rise to elements in the K_2 of modular curves, satisfies the norm relation for GL_2. We make this common property clear, generalizing everything to GL_d. <br />As an application (our main arithmetic result), we construct elements in the motivic cohomology of Drinfeld modular schemes with integral coefficient and show that the norm relation common to Euler systems (i.e., the norm of one element is described using the local L-factor times another element) hold. This improves the older result which was done for Drinfeld modular varieties (over the function field as opposed to the ring of integers) and with coefficients in the rationals. <br />We use the language of Y-sites (<a href="/abs/1506.08023">arXiv:1506.08023</a>) which is introduced in order to simplify the computation common to the theory of automorphic forms. Instead of double cosets, we work more systematically with torsion modules and Q-morphisms between them. The idea is that torsion modules are level structures, and Q-morphisms induce morphisms between some moduli spaces. Chapters 1 and 3 serve as a sequel: further generalities on Y-sites, more examples of Y-sites, and proofs of some statements in loc.cit are given. An application is also given: we provide a group theoretic formulation of a conjecture of Tamagawa on affine curves over an algebraic closure of a finite field.;math.NT
1801.04820;$S$-almost perfect commutative rings;Given a multiplicative subset $S$ in a commutative ring $R$, we consider $S$-weakly cotorsion and $S$-strongly flat $R$-modules, and show that all $R$-modules have $S$-strongly flat covers if and only if all flat $R$-modules are $S$-strongly flat. These equivalent conditions hold if and only if the localization $R_S$ is a perfect ring and, for every element $s\in S$, the quotient ring $R/sR$ is a perfect ring, too. The multiplicative subset $S\subset R$ is allowed to contain zero-divisors.;math.AC
1801.04827;Notes on the Frobenius test exponents;In this paper we show that the Frobenius test exponent for parameter ideals of a local ring of prime characteristic is always bigger than or equal to its Hartshorne-Speiser-Lyubeznik number. Our argument is based on an isomorphism of Nagel and Schenzel on local cohomology that we will provide an elementary proof.;math.AC
1801.04836;The number of representations by a ternary sum of triangular numbers;For positive integers $a,b,c$, and an integer $n$, the number of integer solutions $(x,y,z) \in \mathbb Z^3$ of $a \frac{x(x-1)}{2} + b \frac{y(y-1)}{2} + c \frac{z(z-1)}{2} = n$ is denoted by $t(a,b,c,n)$. In this article, we prove some relations between $t(a,b,c,n)$ and the numbers of representations of integers by some ternary quadratic forms. In particular, we prove various conjectures given by Z. H. Sun in \cite{s}.;math.NT
1801.04840;Pressure Reconstruction for Weak Solutions of the Two-Phase Incompressible Navier--Stokes Equations with Surface Tension;For the two-phase incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with surface tension, we derive an appropriate weak formulation incorporating a variational formulation using divergence-free test functions. We prove a consistency result to justify our definition and, under reasonable regularity assumptions, we reconstruct the pressure function from the weak formulation.;math.AP
1801.04843;Relation between the Resonance and the Scattering Matrix in the massless Spin-Boson Model;We establish the precise relation between the integral kernel of the scattering matrix and the resonance in the massless Spin-Boson model which describes the interaction of a two-level quantum system with a second-quantized scalar field. For this purpose, we derive an explicit formula for the two-body scattering matrix. We impose an ultraviolet cut-off and assume a slightly less singular behavior of the boson form factor of the relativistic scalar field but no infrared cut-off. The purpose of this work is to bring together scattering and resonance theory and arrive at a similar result as provided by Simon in [38], where it was shown that the singularities of the meromorphic continuation of the integral kernel of the scattering matrix are located precisely at the resonance energies. The corresponding problem has been open in quantum field theory ever since. To the best of our knowledge, the presented formula provides the first rigorous connection between resonance and scattering theory in the sense of [38] in a model of quantum field theory.;math-ph
1801.04844;Quantization of Noncompact Coverings and Strong Morita Equivalence;Any finite algebraic Galois covering corresponds to an algebraic Morita equivalence. Here the $C^*$-algebraic analog of this fact is proven, i.e. any noncommutative finite-fold covering corresponds to a strong Morita equivalence.;math.OA
1801.04845;GIT versus Baily-Borel compactification for $K3$&#x27,s which are double covers of $\mathbb P^1\times\mathbb P^1$;In previous work, we have introduced a program aimed at studying the birational geometry of locally symmetric varieties of Type IV associated to moduli of certain projective varieties of K3 type. In particular, a concrete goal of our program is to understand the relationship between GIT and Baily-Borel compactifications for quartic K3 surfaces, K3's which are double covers of a smooth quadric surface, and double EPW sextics. In our first paper (<a href="/abs/1607.01324">arXiv:1607.01324</a>), based on arithmetic considerations, we have given conjectural decompositions into simple birational transformations of the period maps from the GIT moduli spaces mentioned above to the corresponding Baily-Borel compactifications. In our second paper (<a href="/abs/1612.07432">arXiv:1612.07432</a>) we studied the case of quartic K3's, we have given geometric meaning to this decomposition and we have partially verified our conjectures. Here, we give a full proof of our conjectures for the moduli space of K3's which are double covers of a smooth quadric surface. The main new tool here is VGIT for (2,4) complete intersection curves.;math.AG
1801.04848;Empirical $L^2$-distance test statistics for ergodic diffusions;The aim of this paper is to introduce a new type of test statistic for simple null hypothesis on one-dimensional ergodic diffusion processes sampled at discrete times. We deal with a quasi-likelihood approach for stochastic differential equations (i.e. local gaussian approximation of the transition functions) and define a test statistic by means of the empirical $L^2$-distance between quasi-likelihoods. We prove that the introduced test statistic is asymptotically distribution free, namely it weakly converges to a $\chi^2$ random variable. Furthermore, we study the power under local alternatives of the parametric test. We show by the Monte Carlo analysis that, in the small sample case, the introduced test seems to perform better than other tests proposed in literature.;math.PR
1801.04852;Border rank is not multiplicative under the tensor product;It has recently been shown that the tensor rank can be strictly submultiplicative under the tensor product, where the tensor product of two tensors is a tensor whose order is the sum of the orders of the two factors. The necessary upper bounds were obtained with help of border rank. It was left open whether border rank itself can be strictly submultiplicative. We answer this question in the affirmative. In order to do so, we construct lines in projective space along which the border rank drops multiple times and use this result in conjunction with a previous construction for a tensor rank drop. Our results also imply strict submultiplicativity for cactus rank and border cactus rank.;math.AG
1801.04853;System-Aware Compression;Many information systems employ lossy compression as a crucial intermediate stage among other processing components. While the important distortion is defined by the system's input and output signals, the compression usually ignores the system structure, therefore, leading to an overall sub-optimal rate-distortion performance. In this paper we propose a compression methodology for an operational rate-distortion optimization considering a known system layout, modeled using linear operators and noise. Using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) technique, we show that the design of the new globally-optimized compression reduces to a standard compression of a "system adjusted" signal. Essentially, the proposed framework leverages standard compression techniques to address practical settings of the noisy source coding problem. We further explain the main ideas of our method by theoretically studying the case of a cyclo-stationary Gaussian signal. We present experimental results for coding of one-dimensional signals and for video compression using the HEVC standard, showing significant gains by the adjustment to an acquisition-rendering system.;cs.IT
1801.04862;On matrix-valued log-concavity and related Prekopa and Brascamp-Lieb inequalities;We propose a new, self-contained, approach to H. Raufi's extension of Prekopa's theorem for matrix-valued log-concave functions. Along the way, new related inequalities are established, in particular a Brascamp-Lieb variance inequality for matrix weights.;math.FA
1801.04866;An inverse problem for the relativistic Schr&#xf6,dinger equation with partial boundary data;We study the inverse problem of determining the vector and scalar potentials $\mathcal{A}(t,x)=\left(A_{0},A_{1},\cdots,A_{n}\right)$ and $q(t,x)$, respectively, in the relativistic Schr\"odinger equation <br />\begin{equation*} <br />\Big{(}\left(\partial_{t}+A_{0}(t,x)\right)^{2}-\sum_{j=1}^{n}\left(\partial_{j}+A_{j}(t,x)\right)^{2}+q(t,x)\Big{)}u(t,x)=0 <br />\end{equation*} <br />in the region $Q=(0,T)\times\Omega$, where $\Omega$ is a $C^{2}$ bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n\geq 3$ and $T&gt,\mbox{diam}(\Omega)$ from partial data on the boundary $\partial Q$. We prove the unique determination of these potentials modulo a natural gauge invariance for the vector field term.;math.AP
1801.04867;Hierarchically hyperbolic groups are determined by their Morse boundaries;We generalize a result of Paulin on the Gromov boundary of hyperbolic groups to the Morse boundary of proper, maximal hierarchically hyperbolic spaces admitting cocompact group actions by isometries. Namely we show that if the Morse boundaries of two such spaces each contain at least three points, then the spaces are quasi-isometric if and only if there exists a 2-stable, quasi-m\"obius homeomorphism between their Morse boundaries. Our result extends a recent result of Charney-Murray, who prove such a classification for CAT(0) groups, and is new for mapping class groups and the fundamental groups of $3$-manifolds without Nil or Sol components.;math.GT
1801.04873;Randomized projection methods for convex feasibility problems: conditioning and convergence rates;Finding a point in the intersection of a collection of closed convex sets, that is the convex feasibility problem, represents the main modeling strategy for many computational problems. In this paper we analyze new stochastic reformulations of the convex feasibility problem in order to facilitate the development of new algorithmic schemes. We also analyze the conditioning problem parameters using certain (linear) regularity assumptions on the individual convex sets. Then, we introduce a general random projection algorithmic framework, which extends to the random settings many existing projection schemes, designed for the general convex feasibility problem. Our general random projection algorithm allows to project simultaneously on several sets, thus providing great flexibility in matching the implementation of the algorithm on the parallel architecture at hand. Based on the conditioning parameters, besides the asymptotic convergence results, we also derive explicit sublinear and linear convergence rates for this general algorithmic framework.;math.OC
1801.04882;Coding over Sets for DNA Storage;In this paper, we study error-correcting codes for the storage of data in synthetic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). We investigate a storage model where data is represented by an unordered set of $M$ sequences, each of length $L$. Errors within that model are losses of whole sequences and point errors inside the sequences, such as substitutions, insertions and deletions. We propose code constructions which can correct these errors with efficient encoders and decoders. By deriving upper bounds on the cardinalities of these codes using sphere packing arguments, we show that many of our codes are close to optimal.;cs.IT
1801.04884;Chern Simons invariants in $KK$ theory;For a unitary representation $\phi$ of the fundamental group of a compact smooth manifold, Atiyah, Patodi, Singer defined the so called $\alpha$-invariant of $\phi$ using the Chern-Simons invariants. In this article using traces on $C^*$-algebras, we give an intrinsically(i.e without using Chern character) define an element in $KK$ with real coefficients theory whose pullback by the representation $\phi$ is the $\alpha$-invariant.;math.KT
1801.04888;Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for Mobile VLC Networks with Random Receiver Orientation;We consider a downlink multiuser visible light communications (VLC) network where users randomly change their location and vertical orientation. The non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) strategy is adopted to serve multiple users simultaneously, and, hence, to improve spectral efficiency. We propose two novel user scheduling schemes for NOMA, which are referred to as individual and group-based. In order to further reduce the computational complexity and link overhead, novel limited-feedback schemes (on channel quality) are also proposed, which basically involve mean vertical angle (instead of its instantaneous value). Moreover, a two-bit feedback scheme is proposed for group-based user scheduling, which relies on not only distance but also vertical angle (in contrast to conventional one-bit feedback with distance only). The outage probability and sum-rate expressions are derived analytically, which show a very good match with the simulation data. Numerical results verify that the practical feedback scheme with the mean vertical angle achieves a near-optimal sum-rate performance, and the two-bit feedback significantly outperforms the one-bit feedback.;cs.IT
1801.04889;On non-amenable embeddable spaces in relation with free products;In this paper we give sufficient conditions for a free product of residually finite groups to admit an embeddable box space. This generalizes the constructions of Arzhantseva, Guentner and Spakula in <a href="/abs/1101.1993">arXiv:1101.1993v2</a> and gives a new class of non-amenable metric spaces with bounded geometry which coarsely embeds into Hilbert space.;math.GR
1801.04893;On the level of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface;Boix-De Stefani-Vanzo defined the notion of level for a smooth projective hypersurface over a finite field in terms of the stabilisation of a chain of ideals previously considered by \`Alvarez-Montaner-Blickle-Lyubeznik, and showed that in the case of an elliptic curve the level is 1 if and only if it is ordinary and 2 otherwise. Here we extend their theorem to the case of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces by relating their level to the $F$-jumping exponents of Blickle-Musta\c{t}\u{a}-Smith and the Hartshorne-Speiser-Lyubeznik numbers of Musta\c{t}\u{a}-Zhang.;math.AG
1801.04896;Magnetic helicity and subsolutions in ideal MHD;We show that ideal 2D MHD does not possess weak solutions (or even subsolutions) with compact support in time and non-trivial magnetic field. We also show that the $\Lambda$-convex hull of ideal MHD has empty interior in both 2D and 3D, this is seen by finding suitable $\Lambda$-convex functions. As a consequence we show that mean-square magnetic potential is conserved in 2D by subsolutions and weak limits of solutions in the physically natural energy space $L^\infty_t L^2_x$, and in 3D we show the conservation of magnetic helicity by $L^3$-integrable subsolutions and weak limits of solutions. However, in 3D the $\Lambda$-convex hull is shown to be large enough that nontrivial smooth, compactly supported strict subsolutions exist.;math.AP
1801.04902;A spectral method for nonlocal diffusion operators on the sphere;We present algorithms for solving spatially nonlocal diffusion models on the unit sphere with spectral accuracy in space. Our algorithms are based on the diagonalizability of nonlocal diffusion operators in the basis of spherical harmonics, the computation of their eigenvalues to high relative accuracy using quadrature and asymptotic formulas, and a fast spherical harmonic transform. These techniques also lead to an efficient implementation of high-order exponential integrators for time-dependent models. We apply our method to the nonlocal Poisson, Allen--Cahn and Brusselator equations.;math.NA
1801.04904;On classification of higher rank Anosov actions on compact manifold;We prove global smooth classification results for TNS totally Anosov Z^k actions on general compact manifolds, under each one of the following conditions: joint integrability, resonance-free or Lyapunov pinching condition. Unlike the previous results, we do not require any uniform quasiconformality or pinching condition of action elements on coarse Lyapunov distributions, nor do we have any restriction on the dimension of coarse Lyapunov distributions. The main novelty is in proving a new standard form of the derivative cocycle for any TNS totally Anosov Z^k action on general manifold. A main idea is to create a new mechanism called a non-uniform redefining argument to prove continuity of general dynamically-defined object, which should apply to more general rigidity problems in dynamical systems.;math.DS
1801.04905;Corrigendum to the paper &quot,A flexible affine $M$-sextic which is algebraically unrealizable&quot,;We prove the algebraic unrealizability of certain isotopy type of plane affine real algebraic M-sextic which is pseudoholomorphically realizable. This result completes the classification up to isotopy of real algebraic affine M-sextics. The proof of this result given in a previous paper by the first two authors was incorrect.;math.AG
1801.04907;Sending Information Through Status Updates;We consider an energy harvesting transmitter sending status updates regarding a physical phenomenon it observes to a receiver. Different from the existing literature, we consider a scenario where the status updates carry information about an independent message. The transmitter encodes this message into the timings of the status updates. The receiver needs to extract this encoded information, as well as update the status of the observed phenomenon. The timings of the status updates, therefore, determine both the age of information (AoI) and the message rate (rate). We study the tradeoff between the achievable message rate and the achievable average AoI. We propose several achievable schemes and compare their rate-AoI performances.;cs.IT
1801.04915;Phillips symmetric operators and their extensions;Let $S$ be a symmetric operator with equal defect numbers and let $\mathfrak{U}$ be a set of unitary operators in a Hilbert space $\mathfrak{H}$. The operator $S$ is called $\mathfrak{U}$-invariant if $US=SU$ for all $U\in\mathfrak{U}$. Phillips \cite{PH} constructed an example of $\mathfrak{U}$-invariant symmetric operator $S$ which has no $\mathfrak{U}$-invariant self-adjoint extensions. It was discovered that such symmetric operator has a constant characteristic function \cite{KO}. For this reason, each symmetric operator $S$ with constant characteristic function is called a \emph{Phillips symmetric operator}.;math.FA
1801.04920;Secrecy Amplification for Distributed Encrypted Sources with Correlated Keys using Affine Encoders;This paper proposed the application of post-encryption-compression (PEC) to strengthen the secrecy in the case of distributed encryption where the encryption keys are correlated to each other. We derive the universal code construction for the compression and the rate region where codes with achievability and secrecy are obtainable. Our main technique is to use affine encoders which are constructed from certain linear encoders to encode the ciphertexts before sending them to public communication channels. We show that if the rates of linear codes are within a certain rate region:(1) information leakage on the original sources from the encoded ciphertexts without the keys is negligible, while (2) one who has legitimate keys is able to retrieve the original source data with negligible error probability.;cs.IT
1801.04923;An MDS-PIR Capacity-Achieving Protocol for Distributed Storage Using Non-MDS Linear Codes;We propose a private information retrieval (PIR) protocol for distributed storage systems with noncolluding nodes where data is stored using an arbitrary linear code. An expression for the PIR rate, i.e., the ratio of the amount of retrieved data per unit of downloaded data, is derived, and a necessary and a sufficient condition for codes to achieve the maximum distance separable (MDS) PIR capacity are given. The necessary condition is based on the generalized Hamming weights of the storage code, while the sufficient condition is based on code automorphisms. We show that cyclic codes and Reed-Muller codes satisfy the sufficient condition and are thus MDS-PIR capacity-achieving.;cs.IT
1801.04947;A Matrix Positivstellensatz with lifting polynomials;Given the projections of two semialgebraic sets defined by polynomial matrix inequalities, it is in general difficult to determine whether one is contained in the other. To address this issue we propose a new matrix Positivstellensatz that uses lifting polynomials. Under the classical archimedean condition and some mild natural assumptions, we prove that such a containment holds if and only if the proposed matrix Positivstellensatz is satisfied. The corresponding certificate can be searched for by solving a semidefinite program. An important application is to certify when a spectrahedrop (i.e., the projection of a spectrahedron) is contained in another one.;math.OC
1801.04953;Fast Uplink Grant for Machine Type Communications: Challenges and Opportunities;The notion of a fast uplink grant is emerging as a promising solution for enabling massive machine type communications (MTCs) in the Internet of Things over cellular networks. By using the fast uplink grant, machine type devices (MTD) will no longer require random access (RA) channels to send scheduling requests. Instead, uplink resources can be actively allocated to MTDs by the base station. In this paper, the challenges and opportunities for adopting the fast uplink grant to support MTCs are investigated. First, the fundamentals of fast uplink grant and its advantages over conventional access schemes: i) fully scheduled with RA process and ii) uncoordinated access, are presented. Then, the key challenges that include the prediction of set of MTDs with data to transmit, as well as the optimal scheduling of MTDs, are exposed. To overcome these challenges, a two-stage approach that includes traffic prediction and optimized scheduling is proposed. For this approach, various solutions for source traffic prediction for periodic MTD traffic are reviewed and novel methods for event-driven traffic prediction are proposed. For optimal allocation of uplink grants, new solutions based on advanced machine learning methods are presented. By using the proposed solutions, the fast uplink grant has the potential to enable cellular networks to support massive MTCs and effectively reduce the signaling overhead and overcome the delay and congestion challenges of conventional RA schemes.;cs.IT
1801.04955;Tame tori in p-adic groups and good semisimple elements;Let G be a reductive group over a non-archimedean local field k. We provide necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for all tori of G to split over a tamely ramified extension of k. We then show the existence of good semisimple elements in every Moy-Prasad filtration coset of the group G(k) and its Lie algebra, assuming the above sufficient conditions are met.;math.RT
1801.04956;Minimal Free Resolutions of the Tangent Cones of Gorenstein Monomial Curves;The aim of the article is to study the minimal free resolution of the tangent cone of Gorenstein monomial curves in affine 4-space. If C is a non-complete intersection Gorenstein monomial curve that the minimal number of generators of its tangent cone is five, we give the explicit minimal free resolution of the tangent cone of these families of curves and show that the possible Betti sequences are (1,5,6,2) and (1,5,5,1). Also, we give the minimal graded free resolution and compute the Hilbert function of the tangent cone of these families as a result.;math.AC
1801.04960;Emergent Planarity in two-dimensional Ising Models with finite-range Interactions;The known Pfaffian structure of the boundary spin correlations, and more generally order-disorder correlation functions, is given a new explanation through simple topological considerations within the model's random current representation. This perspective is then employed in the proof that the Pfaffian structure of boundary correlations emerges asymptotically at criticality in Ising models on $\mathbb Z^2$ with finite-range interactions. The analysis is enabled by new results on the stochastic geometry of the corresponding random currents. The proven statement establishes an aspect of universality, seen here in the emergence of fermionic structures in two dimensions beyond the solvable cases.;math-ph
1801.04963;Accurate estimates of (1+x)^{1/x} Involved in Carleman Inequality and Keller Limit;In this paper, using the Maclaurin series of the functions $(1+x)^{1/x}$, some inequalities from papers Bicheng Debnath [1998] and Mortici Jang [2015] are generalized. For arbitrary Maclaurin series some general limits of Keller's type are defined and applying for generalization of some well known results.;math.CA
1801.04965;Changing and unchanging of the domination number of a graph: Path addition numbers;Given a graph $G = (V,E)$ and two its distinct vertices $u$ and $v$. The $(u,v)$-$P_k$-{\em addition graph} of $G$ is the graph $G_{u,v,k-2}$ obtained from disjoint union of $G$ and a path $P_k: x_0,x_1,..,x_{k-1}$, $k \geq 2$, by identifying the vertices $u$ and $x_0$, and identifying the vertices $v$ and $x_{k-1}$. We prove that (a) $ \gamma(G)-1 \leq \gamma(G_{u,v,k})$ for all $k \geq 1$, and (b) $\gamma(G_{u,v,k}) &gt, \gamma(G)$ when $k \geq 5$. We also provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the equality $\gamma(G_{u,v,k}) = \gamma(G)$ to be valid for each pair $u,v \in V(G)$. pair $u,v \in V(G)$.;math.CO
1801.04968;On Goodman realizability;Goodman's theorem (1976) states that intuitionistic finite-type arithmetic plus the axiom of choice plus the axiom of relativized dependent choice is conservative over Heyting arithmetic. The same result applies to the extensional variant. This is due to Beeson (1979). In this paper we modify Goodman realizability (1978) and provide a new proof of the extensional case.;math.LO
1801.04970;Product Gauges for Product Domains;In generalized Riemann integration (or Henstock-Kurzweil integration), the formation of the partitions used in Riemann sum construction is regulated by rules known as gauges. This article examines gauges for multi-dimensional Cartesian product domains.;math.CA
1801.04973;Two-Stage LASSO ADMM Signal Detection Algorithm For Large Scale MIMO;This paper explores the benefit of using some of the machine learning techniques and Big data optimization tools in approximating maximum likelihood (ML) detection of Large Scale MIMO systems. First, large scale MIMO detection problem is formulated as a LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) optimization problem. Then, Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is considered in solving this problem. The choice of ADMM is motivated by its ability of solving convex optimization problems by breaking them into smaller sub-problems, each of which are then easier to handle. Further improvement is obtained using two stages of LASSO with interference cancellation from the first stage. The proposed algorithm is investigated at various modulation techniques with different number of antennas. It is also compared with widely used algorithms in this field. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm for both uncoded and coded cases.;cs.IT
1801.04976;Topological K-Theory for Hilbert Scheme Analogs;In geometric representation theory, it is common to compute equivariant $K$ theory of schemes like $Hilb^n ( \mathbb{A}^2 )$ or $Hilb^n (X)$ for an ALE resolution $X \to \mathbb{A}^2 / \Gamma$. If we abandon the algebraic nature and just look at this homotopically we see close relatives of $BS_n$ and $B(\Gamma \wr S_n)$. Therefore we compute the topological K theory of these classifying spaces to fill in a small gap in the literature.;math.AT
1801.04977;Spectra of Tridiagonal Matrices;We characterize the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a class of complex valued tridiagonal $n$ by $n$ matrices subject to arbitrary boundary conditions, i.e. with arbitrary elements on the first and last rows of the matrix. %By boundary conditions, we mean the first and last row of the matrix. For large $n$, we show there are up to $4$ eigenvalues, the so-called \emph{special eigenvalues}, whose behavior depends sensitively on the boundary conditions. The other eigenvalues, the so-called \emph{regular eigenvalues} vary very little as function of the boundary conditions. For large $n$, we determine the regular eigenvalues up to ${\cal O}(n^{-2})$, and the special eigenvalues up to ${\cal O}(\kappa^n)$, for some $\kappa\in (0,1)$. The components of the eigenvectors are determined up to ${\cal O}(n^{-1})$. <br />The matrices we study have important applications throughout the sciences. Among the most common ones are arrays of linear dynamical systems with nearest neighbor coupling, and discretizations of second order linear partial differential equations. In both cases, we give examples where specific choices of boundary conditions substantially influence leading eigenvalues, and therefore the global dynamics of the system.;math.NA
1801.04982;Computing effectively stabilizing controllers for a class of $n$D systems;In this paper, we study the internal stabilizability and internal stabilization problems for multidimensional (nD) systems. Within the fractional representation approach, a multidimen-sional system can be studied by means of matrices with entries in the integral domain of structurally stable rational fractions, namely the ring of rational functions which have no poles in the closed unit polydisc U n = {z = (z 1 ,. .. , z n) $\in$ C n | |z 1 | 1,. .. , |z n | 1}. It is known that the internal stabilizability of a multidimensional system can be investigated by studying a certain polynomial ideal I = p 1 ,. .. , p r that can be explicitly described in terms of the transfer matrix of the plant. More precisely the system is stabilizable if and only if V (I) = {z $\in$ C n | p 1 (z) = $\times$ $\times$ $\times$ = p r (z) = 0} $\cap$ U n = $\emptyset$. In the present article, we consider the specific class of linear nD systems (which includes the class of 2D systems) for which the ideal I is zero-dimensional, i.e., the p i 's have only a finite number of common complex zeros. We propose effective symbolic-numeric algorithms for testing if V (I) $\cap$ U n = $\emptyset$, as well as for computing, if it exists, a stable polynomial p $\in$ I which allows the effective computation of a stabilizing controller. We illustrate our algorithms through an example and finally provide running times of prototype implementations for 2D and 3D systems.;math.NA
1801.04984;Space-Time-Parallel Poroelasticity Simulation;The accurate, reliable and efficient numerical approximation of multi-physics processes in heterogeneous porous media with varying media coefficients that include fluid flow and structure interactions is of fundamental importance in energy, environmental, petroleum and biomedical engineering applications fields for instance. Important applications include subsurface compaction drive, carbon sequestration, hydraulic and thermal fracturing and oil recovery. Biomedical applications include the simulation of vibration therapy for osteoporosis processes of trabeculae bones, estimating stress levels induced by tumour growth within the brain or next-generation spinal disc prostheses. <br />Variational space-time methods offers some appreciable advantages such as the flexibility of the triangulation for complex geometries in space and natural local time stepping, the straightforward construction of higher-order approximations and the application of efficient goal-oriented (duality-based) adaptivity concepts. In addition to that, uniform space-time variational methods appear to be advantageous for stability and a priori error analyses of the discrete schemes. Especially (high-order) discontinuous in time approaches appear to have favourable properties due to the weak application of the initial conditions. <br />The development of monolithic multi-physics schemes, instead of iterative coupling methods between the physical problems, is a key component of the research to reduce the modeling error. Special emphasis is on the development of efficient multi-physics and multigrid preconditioning technologies and their implementation. <br />The simulation software DTM++ is a modularised framework written in C++11 and builds on top of deal.II toolchains. The implementation allows parallel simulations from notebooks up to cluster scale.;math.NA
1801.04985;Routeing properties in a Gibbsian model for highly dense multihop networks;We investigate a probabilistic model for routeing in a multihop ad-hoc communication network, where each user sends a message to the base station. Messages travel in hops via other users, used as relays. Their trajectories are chosen at random according to a Gibbs distribution, which favours trajectories with low interference, measured in terms of signal-to-interference ratio. This model was introduced in our earlier paper [KT18], where we expressed, in the limit of a high density of users, the typical distribution of the family of trajectories in terms of a law of large numbers. In the present work, we derive its qualitative properties. We analytically identify the emerging typical scenarios in three extreme regimes. We analyse the typical number of hops and the typical length of a hop, and the deviation of the trajectory from the straight line, (1) in the limit of a large communication area and large distances, and (2) in the limit of a strong interference weight. In both regimes, the typical trajectory approaches a straight line quickly, in regime (1) with equal hop lengths. Interestingly, in regime (1), the typical length of a hop diverges logarithmically in the distance of the transmitter to the base station. We further analyse (3) local and global repulsive effects of a densely populated subarea on the trajectories.;math.OC
1801.04986;Simulation of thin film flows with a moving mesh mixed finite element method;We present an efficient mixed finite element method to solve the fourth-order thin film flow equations using moving mesh refinement. The moving mesh strategy is based on harmonic mappings developed by Li et al. [J. Comput. Phys., 170 (2001), pp. 562-588, and 177 (2002), pp. 365-393]. To achieve a high quality mesh, we adopt an adaptive monitor function and smooth it based on a diffusive mechanism. A variety of numerical tests are performed to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the method. The moving mesh refinement accurately resolves the overshoot and downshoot structures and reduces the computational cost in comparison to numerical simulations using a fixed mesh.;math.NA
1801.04988;Weighted Energy-Dissipation principle for gradient flows in metric spaces;This paper develops the so-called Weighted Energy-Dissipation (WED) variational approach for the analysis of gradient flows in metric spaces. This focuses on the minimization of the parameter-dependent global-in-time functional of trajectories \[ \mathcal{I}_\varepsilon[u] = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-t/\varepsilon}\left( \frac12 |u'|^2(t) + \frac1{\varepsilon}\phi(u(t)) \right) \dd t, \] featuring the weighted sum of energetic and dissipative terms. As the parameter $\varepsilon$ is sent to~$0$, the minimizers $u_\varepsilon$ of such functionals converge, up to subsequences, to curves of maximal slope driven by the functional $\phi$. This delivers a new and general variational approximation procedure, hence a new existence proof, for metric gradient flows. In addition, it provides a novel perspective towards relaxation.;math.AP
1801.04989;$m$-cluster tilted algebras of euclidean type;We consider $m$-cluster tilted algebras arising from quivers of Euclidean type and we give necessary and sufficient conditions for those algebras to be representation finite. For the case $\widetilde{A}$, using the geometric realization, we get a description of representation finite type in terms of $(m+2)$-angulations. We establish which $m$-cluster tilted algebras arise at the same time from quivers of type $A$ and $\widetilde{A}$. Finally, we characterize representation infinite $m$-cluster tilted algebras arising from a quiver of type $\widetilde{A}$ as $m$-relations extensions of some iterated tilted algebra of type $\widetilde{A}$.;math.RT
1801.04995;Extended Mittag-Leffler Function and truncated $&#x3bd,$-fractional derivatives;The main objective of this article is to present $\nu$-fractional derivative $\mu$-differentiable functions by considering 4-parameters extended Mittag-Leffler function (MLF). We investigate that the new $\nu$-fractional derivative satisfies various properties of order calculus such as chain rule, product rule, Rolle's and mean-value theorems for $\mu$-differentiable function and its extension. Moreover, we define the generalized form of inverse property and the fundamental theorem of calculus and the mean-value theorem for integrals. Also, we establish a relationship with fractional integral through truncated $\nu$-fractional integral.;math.CA
1801.04996;Energy-preserving Variational Integrators for Forced Lagrangian Systems;The goal of this paper is to develop energy-preserving variational integrators for time-dependent mechanical systems with forcing. We first present the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle in the extended Lagrangian mechanics framework and derive the extended forced Euler-Lagrange equations in continuous-time. We then obtain the extended forced discrete Euler-Lagrange equations using the extended discrete mechanics framework and derive adaptive time step variational integrators for time-dependent Lagrangian systems with forcing. We consider two numerical examples to study the numerical performance of energy-preserving variational integrators. First, we consider the example of a nonlinear conservative system to illustrate the advantages of using adaptive time-stepping in variational integrators. We show a trade-off between energy-preserving performance and accurate discrete trajectories while choosing an initial time step. In addition, we demonstrate how the implicit equations become more ill-conditioned as the adaptive time step increases through a condition number analysis. As a second example, we numerically simulate a damped harmonic oscillator using the adaptive time step variational integrator framework. The adaptive time step increases monotonically for the dissipative system leading to unexpected energy behavior.;math.NA
1801.04997;Boundedness and compactness characterizations of Cauchy integral commutators on Morrey spaces;Let $C_\Gamma$ be the Cauchy integral operator on a Lipschitz curve $\Gamma$. In this article, the authors show that the commutator $[b,C_\Gamma]$ is bounded (resp., compact) on the Morrey space $L^{p,\,\lambda}(\mathbb R)$ for any (or some) $p\in(1, \infty)$ and $\lambda\in(0, 1)$ if and only if $b\in {\rm BMO}(\mathbb R)$ (resp., ${\rm CMO}(\mathbb R)$). As an application, a factorization of the classical Hardy space $H^1(\mathbb R)$ in terms of $C_\Gamma$ and its adjoint operator is obtained.;math.CA

1801.04999;A fast ADI algorithm for nonlinear Poisson equation in heterogeneous dielectric media;Recently, a nonlinear Poisson equation has been introduced to model nonlinear and nonlocal hyperpolarization effects in electrostatic solute-solvent interaction for biomolecular solvation analysis. Due to a strong nonlinearity associated with the heterogeneous dielectric media, this Poisson model is difficult to solve numerically, particularly for large protein systems. A new pseudo-transient continuation approach is proposed in this paper to efficiently and stably solve the nonlinear Poisson equation. A Douglas type alternating direction implicit (ADI) method is developed for solving the pseudo-time dependent Poisson equation. Different approximations to the dielectric profile in heterogeneous media are considered in the standard finite difference discretization. The proposed ADI scheme is validated by considering benchmark examples with exact solutions and by solvation analysis of real biomolecules with various sizes. Numerical results are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction, experimental measurements, and those obtained from the boundary value problem approach. Since the time stability of the proposed ADI scheme can be maintained even using very large time increments, it is efficient for electrostatic analysis involving hyperpolarization effects.;math.NA
1801.05001;On a certain extension of the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative operator;The main aim of this present paper is to present a new extension of the fractional derivative operator by using the extension of Beta function recently defined by Shadab et al.[19]. Moreover, we establish some results related to the newly defined modified fractional derivative operator such as Mellin transform and relations to extended hypergeometric and Appell's function via generating functions.;math.CA
1801.05002;The self-justifying Elo rating system;We suggest an improvement of the Elo rating system. Whereas Elo's theoretical background remains unaffected, we significantly change the way in which rating values are adjusted. It turns out that the modified system behaves much more naturally, and that it offers several advantages over the classical one. The key idea is a fixed point approach to the definition of the rating values. We provide an algorithm for the purpose of their computation.;math.CA
1801.05003;Bounds for some entropies and special functions;We consider a family of probability distributions depending on a real parameter and including the binomial, Poisson and negative binomial distributions. The corresponding index of coincidence satisfies a Heun differential equation and is a logarithmically convex function. Combining these facts we get bounds for the index of coincidence, and consequently for R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis entropies of order $2$.;math.CA
1801.05004;Heun functions related to entropies;We consider the indices of coincidence for the binomial, Poisson, and negative binomial distributions. They are related in a simple manner to the R\'{e}nyi entropy and Tsallis entropy. We investigate some families of Heun functions containing these indices of coincidence. For the involved Heun functions we obtain closed forms, explicit expressions, or representations in terms of hypergeometric functions.;math.CA
1801.05005;Two-stack-sorting with pop stacks;We consider the set of permutations that are sorted after two passes through a pop stack. We characterize these permutations in terms of forbidden patterns (classical and barred) and enumerate them according to the ascent statistic. Then we show these permutations to be in bijection with a special family of polyominoes. As a consequence, the permutations sortable by this machine are shown to have the same enumeration as three classical permutation classes.;math.CO
1801.05006;Means of iterates;We determine continuous bijections $f$, acting on a real interval into itself, whose $k$-fold iterate is the quasi-arithmetic mean of all its subsequent iterates from $f^0$ up to $f^n$ (where $0\le k\le n$). Namely, we prove that if at most one of the numbers $k,n$ is odd, then such functions consist of at most three affine pieces.;math.CA
1801.05008;Extremal Polynomials and Entire Functions of Exponential Type;In this paper, we discuss asymptotic relations for the approximation of $\left\vert x\right\vert ^{\alpha},\alpha&gt,0$ in $L_{\infty}\left[ -1,1\right] $ by Lagrange interpolation polynomials based on the zeros of the Chebyshev polynomials of first kind. The limiting process reveals an entire function of exponential type for which we can present an explicit formula. As a consequence, we further deduce an asymptotic relation for the Approximation error when $\alpha\rightarrow\infty$. Finally, we present connections of our results together with some recent work of Ganzburg [5] and Lubinsky [10], by presenting numerical results, indicating a possible constructive way towards a representation for the Bernstein constants.;math.CA
1801.05018;Robust port-Hamiltonian representations of passive systems;We discuss the problem of robust representations of stable and passive transfer functions in particular coordinate systems, and focus in particular on the so-called port-Hamiltonian representations. Such representations are typically far from unique and the degrees of freedom are related to the solution set of the so-called Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov linear matrix inequality (LMI). In this paper we analyze robustness measures for the different possible representations and relate it to quality functions defined in terms of the eigenvalues of the matrix associated with the LMI. In particular, we look at the analytic center of this LMI. From this, we then derive inequalities for the passivity radius of the given model representation.;math.OC
1801.05021;Real-time imaging of interfacial damage in layered composites;A theoretical platform is developed for active elastic-wave sensing of (stationary and advancing) fractures along bi-material interfaces in layered composites. Damaged contact surfaces are characterized by a heterogeneous distribution of (elastic) stiffness $\boldsymbol{K}$ which is a-priori unknown. The proposed imaging functional takes advantage of sequential wavefield measurements for non-iterative and concurrent reconstruction of multiple fractures in heterogeneous domains, with an exceptional spatial resolution and with minimal sensitivity to measurement errors and uncertain elasticity of damage zones. This is accomplished through adaptation of the $F_\sharp$-factorization method (FM) applied to elastodynamic wavefields in a sensing sequence i.e. a measurement campaign performed before and after the formation (or evolution) of interfacial fractures. The direct scattering problem is formulated in the frequency domain where the damage support is illuminated by a set of incident P- and S-waves, and thus-induced scattered waves are monitored at the far field. In this setting, the germane mixed reciprocity principle is introduced, and $F_\sharp$-factorization of the differential scattering operator is rigorously established for composite backgrounds. These results lead to the development of an FM-based fracture indicator whose affiliated cost functional is inherently convex, thus, its minimizer can be computed without iterations. This attribute coupled with the reduced sampling space, proposed in this work, remarkably expedite the data inversion process. The performance of proposed imaging functional is demonstrated by a set of numerical experiments.;math.NA
1801.05034;The Perron-Frobenius theorem for multi-homogeneous mappings;The Perron-Frobenius theory for nonnegative matrices has been generalized to order-preserving homogeneous mappings on a cone and more recently to nonnegative multilinear forms. <br />We unify both approaches by introducing the concept of order-preserving multi-homogeneous mappings, their associated nonlinear spectral problems and spectral radii. We show several Perron-Frobenius type results for these mappings addressing existence, uniqueness and maximality of nonnegative and positive eigenpairs. We prove a Collatz-Wielandt principle and other characterizations of the spectral radius and analyze the convergence of iterates of these mappings towards their unique positive eigenvectors. On top of providing a remarkable extension of the nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory to the multi-dimensional case, our contribution poses the basis for several improvements and a deeper understanding of the current spectral theory for nonnegative tensors. In fact, in recent years, important results have been obtained by recasting certain spectral equations for multilinear forms in terms of homogeneous maps, however as our approach is more adapted to such problems, these results can be further refined and improved by employing our new multi-homogeneous setting.;math.SP
1801.05035;Homogenization of the first initial boundary-value problem for parabolic systems: operator error estimates;Let $\mathcal{O}\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ be a bounded domain of class $C^{1,1}$. In $L_2(\mathcal{O},\mathbb{C}^n)$, we consider a selfadjoint matrix second order elliptic differential operator $B_{D,\varepsilon}$, $0&lt,\varepsilon\leqslant1$, with the Dirichlet boundary condition. The principal part of the operator is given in a factorized form. The operator involves first and zero order terms. The operator $B_{D,\varepsilon}$ is positive definite, its coefficients are periodic and depend on $\mathbf{x}/\varepsilon$. We study the behavior of the operator exponential $e^{-B_{D,\varepsilon}t}$, $t&gt,0$, as $\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$. We obtain approximations for the exponential $e^{-B_{D,\varepsilon}t}$ in the operator norm on $L_2(\mathcal{O},\mathbb{C}^n)$ and in the norm of operators acting from $L_2(\mathcal{O},\mathbb{C}^n)$ to the Sobolev space $H^1(\mathcal{O},\mathbb{C}^n)$. The results are applied to homogenization of solutions of the first initial boundary-value problem for parabolic systems.;math.AP
1801.05036;Configurations of points with sum 0;We compute the virtual Poincar\'e polynomials of the configuration space of $n$ ordered points on an elliptic curve with sum 0.;math.CO
1801.05037;A fast new algorithm for weak graph regularity;We provide a deterministic algorithm that finds, in $\epsilon^{-O(1)} n^2$ time, an $\epsilon$-regular Frieze-Kannan partition of a graph on $n$ vertices. The algorithm outputs an approximation of a given graph as a weighted sum of $\epsilon^{-O(1)}$ many complete bipartite graphs. <br />As a corollary, we give a deterministic algorithm for estimating the number of copies of $H$ in an $n$-vertex graph $G$ up to an additive error of at most $\epsilon n^{v(H)}$, in time $\epsilon^{-O_H(1)}n^2$.;math.CO
1801.05043;Resistance growth of branching random networks;Consider a rooted infinite Galton-Watson tree with mean offspring number $m&gt,1$, and a collection of i.i.d. positive random variables $\xi_e$ indexed by all the edges in the tree. We assign the resistance $m^d \xi_e$ to each edge $e$ at distance $d$ from the root. In this random electric network, we study the asymptotic behavior of the effective resistance and conductance between the root and the vertices at depth $n$. Our results generalize an existing work of Addario-Berry, Broutin and Lugosi on the binary tree to random branching networks.;math.PR
1801.05048;Latent nested nonparametric priors;Discrete random structures are important tools in Bayesian nonparametrics and the resulting models have proven effective in density estimation, clustering, topic modeling and prediction, among others. In this paper, we consider nested processes and study the dependence structures they induce. Dependence ranges between homogeneity, corresponding to full exchangeability, and maximum heterogeneity, corresponding to (unconditional) independence across samples. The popular nested Dirichlet process is shown to degenerate to the fully exchangeable case when there are ties across samples at the observed or latent level. To overcome this drawback, inherent to nesting general discrete random measures, we introduce a novel class of latent nested processes. These are obtained by adding common and group-specific completely random measures and, then, normalising to yield dependent random probability measures. We provide results on the partition distributions induced by latent nested processes, and develop an Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler for Bayesian inferences. A test for distributional homogeneity across groups is obtained as a by product. The results and their inferential implications are showcased on synthetic and real data.;math.ST
1801.05054;Heun functions and combinatorial identities;We give closed forms for several families of Heun functions related to classical entropies. By comparing two expressions of the same Heun function, we get several combinatorial identities generalizing some classical ones.;math.CA
1801.05065;Comonad Cohomology of Track Categories;We define a comonad cohomology of track categories and we show it is linked by a long exact sequence to its Dwyer-Kan-Smith cohomology . Under mild hypothesis on the track category, we show that its comonad cohomology coincides, up to dimension shift, with its Dwyer-Kan-Smith cohomology, therefore obtaining an algebraic formulation of the latter. We also specialize our results to the case where the track category is a $2$-groupoid.;math.AT
1801.05067;Gradient estimates for oblique derivative problems via the maximum principle;We prove gradient estimates for solutions of the oblique derivative problem for a large class of elliptic and parabolic quasilinear PDEs. In particular, we expand on previous work of the author using a maximum principle argument. In addition, we prove estimates for the parabolic problem of evolution via mean curvature with nonzero Neumann data, which seem to be new.;math.AP
1801.05069;Triangulations with few vertices of manifolds with non-free fundamental group;We study lower bounds for the number of vertices in a PL-triangulation of a given manifold $M$. While most of the previous estimates are based on the dimension and the connectivity of $M$, we show that further information can be extracted by studying the structure of the fundamental group of $M$ and applying techniques from the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category theory. In particular, we prove that every PL-triangulation of a $d$-dimensional manifold ($d\ge 3$) whose fundamental group is not free has at least $3d+1$ vertices. As a corollary, every $d$-dimensional ($\mathbb{Z}_p$-)homology sphere that admits a PL-triangulation with less than $3d$ vertices is homeomorphic to $S^d$. Another important consequence is that every triangulation with small links of $M$ is combinatorial.;math.GT
1801.05071;A Finite Block Length Achievability Bound for Low Probability of Detection Communication;Low probability of detection (or covert) communication refers to the scenario where information must be sent reliably to a receiver, but with low probability of detection by an adversary. Recent works on the fundamental limits of this communication problem have established achievability and converse bounds that are asymptotic in the block length of the code. This paper uses Gallager's random coding bound to derive a new achievability bound that is applicable to low probability of detection communication in the finite block length regime. Further insights are unveiled that are otherwise hidden in previous asymptotic analyses.;cs.IT

1801.05081;On uniqueness sets of additive eigenvalue problems and applications;In this paper, we provide a simple way to find uniqueness sets for additive eigenvalue problems of first and second order Hamilton--Jacobi equations by using a PDE approach. An application in finding the limiting profiles for large time behaviors of first order Hamilton--Jacobi equations is also obtained.;math.AP
1801.05083;The level set flow of a hypersurface in $\mathbb R^4$ of low entropy does not disconnect;We show that if $\Sigma\subset \mathbb R^4$ is a closed, connected hypersurface with entropy $\lambda(\Sigma)\leq \lambda(\mathbb{S}^2\times \mathbb R)$, then the level set flow of $\Sigma$ never disconnects. We also obtain a sharp version of the forward clearing out lemma for non-fattening flows in $\mathbb R^4$ of low entropy.;math.DG
1801.05089;Reed-Muller Sequences for 5G Grant-free Massive Access;We propose to use second order Reed-Muller (RM) sequence for user identification in 5G grant-free access. The benefits of RM sequences mainly lie in two folds, (i) support of much larger user space, hence lower collision probability and (ii) lower detection complexity. These two features are essential to meet the massive connectivity ($10^7$ links/km$^2$), ultra-reliable and low-latency requirements in 5G, e.g., one-shot transmission ($\leq 1$ms) with $\leq 10^{-4}$ packet error rate. However, the non-orthogonality introduced during sequence space expansion leads to worse detection performance. In this paper, we propose a noise-resilient detection algorithm along with a layered sequence construction to meet the harsh requirements. Link-level simulations in both narrow-band and OFDM-based scenarios show that RM sequences are suitable for 5G.;cs.IT
1801.05095;On the Analysis of Puncturing for Finite-Length Polar Codes: Boolean Function Approach;This paper investigates the impact of puncturing on finite-length polar codes in which a puncturing pattern $\pv^{N}=(p_0,...,p_N)$ is applied to a length-$N$ polar code.. We first introduce two virtual channels to stochastically model the punctured (untransmitted) bits, which are respectively called {\em useless channel model} (UCM) and {\em deterministic channel model} (DCM). Under each model, we derive boolean functions in variables $p_0,...,p_{N-1}$ that can indicate which polarized channels should carry frozen bits. Based on this, we present an efficient method to jointly optimize a puncturing pattern and an information set. Focusing on a fixed information set, we show that there exist the so-called {\em catastrophic} puncturing patterns that will surely lead to a block error and derive their weight distributions recursively. We then propose the two construction methods of a rate-compatible (RC) polar code which ensures that each puncturing pattern in the family is non-catastrophic. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RC polar code outperform the RC Turbo code adopted in LTE.;cs.IT
1801.05097;Boolean Function Analogs of Covering Systems;Bob Hough recently disproved a long-standing conjecture of Paul Erd\H{o}s regarding covering systems. Inspired by his seminal paper, we describe analogs of covering systems to Boolean functions, and more generally, the problem of covering discrete hyper-boxes by non-parallel lower dimensional hyper-subboxes. We point out that very often primes are red herrings. This is definitely the case for covering system, and who knows, perhaps also for the Riemann Hypothesis.;math.CO
1801.05101;On the I/O Costs of Some Repair Schemes for Full-Length Reed-Solomon Codes;Network transfer and disk read are the most time consuming operations in the repair process for node failures in erasure-code-based distributed storage systems. Recent developments on Reed-Solomon codes, the most widely used erasure codes in practical storage systems, have shown that efficient repair schemes specifically tailored to these codes can significantly reduce the network bandwidth spent to recover single failures. However, the I/O cost, that is, the number of disk reads performed in these repair schemes remains largely unknown. We take the first step to address this gap in the literature by investigating the I/O costs of some existing repair schemes for full-length Reed-Solomon codes.;cs.IT
1801.05104;Throughput Maximization in Cloud Radio Access Networks using Network Coding;This paper is interested in maximizing the total throughput of cloud radio access networks (CRANs) in which multiple radio remote heads (RRHs) are connected to a central computing unit known as the cloud. The transmit frame of each RRH consists of multiple radio resources blocks (RRBs), and the cloud is responsible for synchronizing these RRBS and scheduling them to users. Unlike previous works that consider allocating each RRB to only a single user at each time instance, this paper proposes to mix the flows of multiple users in each RRB using instantly decodable network coding (IDNC). The proposed scheme is thus designed to jointly schedule the users to different RRBs, choose the encoded file sent in each of them, and the rate at which each of them is transmitted. Hence, the paper maximizes the throughput which is defined as the number of correctly received bits. To jointly fulfill this objective, we design a graph in which each vertex represents a possible user-RRB association, encoded file, and transmission rate. By appropriately choosing the weights of vertices, the scheduling problem is shown to be equivalent to a maximum weight clique problem over the newly introduced graph. Simulation results illustrate the significant gains of the proposed scheme compared to classical coding and uncoded solutions.;cs.IT
1801.05105;Second Order Spiral Splines;Second order spiral splines are $C^2$ unit-speed planar curves that can be used to interpolate a list $Y$ of $n+1$ points in $\R ^2$ at times specified in some list $T$, where $n\geq 2$. Asymptotic methods are used to develop a fast algorithm, based on a pair of tridiagonal linear systems and standard software. The algorithm constructs a second order spiral spline interpolant for data that is convex and sufficiently finely sampled.;math.NA
1801.05106;A discretized Severi-type theorem with applications to harmonic analysis;In 1901, Severi proved that if $Z$ is an irreducible hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}^4(\mathbb{C})$ that contains a three dimensional set of lines, then $Z$ is either a quadratic hypersurface or a scroll of planes. We prove a discretized version of this result for hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{R}^4$. As an application, we prove that at most $\delta^{-2-\varepsilon}$ direction-separated $\delta$-tubes can be contained in the $\delta$-neighborhood of a low-degree hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^4$. <br />This result leads to improved bounds on the restriction and Kakeya problems in $\mathbb{R}^4$. Combined with previous work of Guth and the author, this result implies a Kakeya maximal function estimate at dimension $3+1/28$, which is an improvement over the previous bound of $3$ due to Wolff. As a consequence, we prove that every Besicovitch set in $\mathbb{R}^4$ must have Hausdorff dimension at least $3+1/28$. Recently, Demeter showed that any improvement over Wolff's bound for the Kakeya maximal function yields new bounds on the restriction problem for the paraboloid in $\mathbb{R}^4$.;math.CA
1801.05112;Exact Error and Erasure Exponents for the Asymmetric Broadcast Channel;Consider the asymmetric broadcast channel with a random superposition codebook, which may be comprised of constant composition or \iid codewords. By applying Forney's optimal decoder for individual messages and the message pair for the receiver that decodes both messages, exact (ensemble-tight) error and erasure exponents are derived. It is shown that the optimal decoder designed to decode the pair of messages achieves the optimal trade-off between the total and undetected exponents associated with the optimal decoder for the private message. Convex optimization-based procedures to evaluate the exponents efficiently are proposed. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the results.;cs.IT
1801.05114;Generalized Reed-Muller codes over Galois rings;Recently, Bhaintwal and Wasan studied the Generalized Reed-Muller codes over the prime power integer residue ring. In this paper, we give a generalization of these codes to Generalized Reed-Muller codes over Galois rings.;cs.IT
1801.05121;Steady-state analysis of the Join the Shortest Queue model in the Halfin-Whitt regime;This paper studies the steady-state properties of the Join the Shortest Queue model in the Halfin-Whitt regime. We focus on the process tracking the number of idle servers, and the number of servers with non-empty buffers. Recently, Eschenfeldt &amp, Gamarnik (2015) proved that a scaled version of this process converges, over finite time intervals, to a two-dimensional diffusion limit as the number of servers goes to infinity. In this paper we prove that the diffusion limit is exponentially ergodic, and that the diffusion scaled sequence of the steady-state number of idle servers and non-empty buffers is tight. Our results mean that the process-level convergence proved in Eschenfeldt &amp, Gamarnik (2015) implies convergence of steady-state distributions. The methodology used is the generator expansion framework based on Stein's method, also referred to as the drift-based fluid limit Lyapunov function approach in Stolyar (2015). One technical contribution to the framework is to show that it can be used as a general tool to establish exponential ergodicity.;math.PR
1801.05126;Group algebra whose unit group is locally nilpotent;We present a complete list of groups $G$ and fields $F$ for which: (i) the group of normalized units V(FG) of the group algebra FG is locally nilpotent, (ii) the group algebra FG has a finite number of nilpotent elements and V(FG) is an Engel group.;math.RA
1801.05128;Free actions of some compact groups on Milnor manifolds;In this paper, we investigate free actions of some compact groups on cohomology real and complex Milnor manifolds. More precisely, we compute the mod 2 cohomology algebra of the orbit space of an arbitrary free $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{S}^1$-action on a compact Hausdorff space with mod 2 cohomology algebra of a real or a complex Milnor manifold. As applications, we deduce some Borsuk-Ulam type results for equivariant maps between spheres and these spaces. For the complex case, we obtain a lower bound on the Schwarz genus, which further establishes the existence of coincidence points for maps to the Euclidean plane.;math.AT
1801.05129;The relevance of Freiman&#x27,s theorem for combinatorial commutative algebra;Freiman's theorem gives a lower bound for the cardinality of the doubling of a finite set in $\RR^n$. In this paper we give an interpretation of his theorem for monomial ideals and their fiber cones. We call a quasi-equigenerated monomial ideal a Freiman ideal, if the set of its exponent vectors achieves Freiman's lower bound for its doubling. Algebraic characterizations of Freiman ideals are given, and finite simple graphs are classified whose edge ideals or matroidal ideals of its cycle matroids are Freiman ideals.;math.AC
1801.05130;Operator splitting for dispersion-generalized Benjamin-Ono equations;We consider the operator splitting for a class of nonlinear equation, which includes the KdV equation, the Benjamin-Ono equation, and the Burgers equation. We prove a first-order approxomation in $\Delta t$ in the Sobolev space for the Godunov splitting, and second-order approximation for the Strang splitting.;math.AP
1801.05137;Total dominator coloring of central graphs;A total dominator coloring of a graph $G$ is a proper coloring of $G$ in which each vertex of the graph is adjacent to every vertex of some color class. The total dominator chromatic number of a graph is the minimum number of color classes in a total dominator coloring of it. Here, we study the total dominator coloring on central graphs by giving some tight bounds for the total dominator chromatic number of the central of a graph, join of two graphs and Nordhaus-Gaddum-like relations. Also we will calculate the total dominator chromatic number of the central of a path, a cycle, a wheel, a complete graph and a complete multipartite graph.;math.CO
1801.05139;Non-commutative crepant resolutions of Hibi rings with small class group;In this paper, we study splitting (or toric) non-commutative crepant resolutions (= NCCRs) of some toric rings. In particular, we consider Hibi rings, which are toric rings arising from partially ordered sets, and show that Gorenstein Hibi rings with class group $\mathbb{Z}^2$ have a splitting NCCR. In the appendix, we also discuss Gorenstein toric rings with class group $\mathbb{Z}$, in which case the existence of splitting NCCRs is already known. We especially observe the mutations of modules giving splitting NCCRs for the three dimensional case, and show the connectedness of the exchange graph.;math.RT
1801.05140;The Dirichlet problem for Fully Nonlinear Equations Arising from Conformal Geometry;We study the Dirichlet problem for a class of curvature equations arising from conformal geometry on Riemannian manifolds $(M^n, g)$ with boundary where $n \geq 3$. We prove there exists a unique solution using the continuity method which is based on \emph{a priori} estimates for admissible solutions. In deriving the estimates, a crucial step is to derive a lower bound for the gradient on the boundary. This is overcome by constructing a cluster of subsolutions.;math.AP
1801.05145;Monoidal categorification of cluster algebras (merged version);We prove that the quantum cluster algebra structure of a unipotent quantum coordinate ring $A_q(\mathfrak{n}(w))$, associated with a symmetric Kac-Moody algebra and its Weyl group element $w$, admits a monoidal categorification via the representations of symmetric Khovanov-Lauda- Rouquier algebras. In order to achieve this goal, we give a formulation of monoidal categorifications of quantum cluster algebras and provide a criterion for a monoidal category of finite-dimensional graded $R$-modules to become a monoidal categorification, where $R$ is a symmetric Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebra. Roughly speaking, this criterion asserts that a quantum monoidal seed can be mutated successively in all the directions, once the first-step mutations are possible. Then, we show the existence of a quantum monoidal seed of $A_q(\mathfrak{n}(w))$ which admits the first-step mutations in all the directions. As a consequence, we prove the conjecture that any cluster monomial is a member of the upper global basis up to a power of $q^{1/2}$. In the course of our investigation, we also give a proof of a conjecture of Leclerc on the product of upper global basis elements.;math.RT
1801.05146;Algorithms for Computing Wiener Indices of Acyclic and Unicyclic Graphs;Let $G=(V(G),E(G))$ be a molecular graph, where $V(G)$ and $E(G)$ are the sets of vertices (atoms) and edges (bonds). A topological index of a molecular graph is a numerical quantity which helps to predict the chemical/physical properties of the molecules. The Wiener, Wiener polarity and the terminal Wiener indices are the distance based topological indices. In this paper, we described a linear time algorithm {\bf(LTA)} that computes the Wiener index for acyclic graphs and extended this algorithm for unicyclic graphs. The same algorithms are modified to compute the terminal Wiener index and the Wiener polarity index. All these algorithms compute the indices in time $O(n)$.;math.CO
1801.05152;Explicit expression of the microscopic renormalized energy for a pinned Ginzburg-Landau functional;We get a new expression of the microscopic renormalized energy for a pinned Ginzburg-Landau type energy modeling small impurities. This is done by obtaining a sharp decomposition for the minimal energy of a Dirichlet type functional with an L $\infty$-weight. In particular we get an explicit expression of the microscopic renormalized energy for a circular impurity. We proceed also to the minimization of this renormalized energy in some cases.;math.AP
1801.05154;On derived equivalences for categories of generalized intervals of a finite poset;We study two constructions related to the intervals of finite posets. The first one is a poset. The second one is more complicated. Loosely speaking it can be seen as a poset with some extra zero-relations. As main result, we show that these two constructions are equivalent at the level of derived categories.;math.CO

1801.05163;Large-scale sublinearly Lipschitz geometry of hyperbolic spaces;Large-scale sublinearly Lipschitz maps have been introduced by Yves Cornulier in order to precisely state his theorems about asymptotic cones of Lie groups. In particular, Sublinearly biLipschitz Equivalences (SBE) are a weak variant of quasiisometries, with the only requirement of still inducing biLipschitz maps at the level of asymptotic cones. We focus here on hyperbolic metric spaces and study properties of their boundary extensions, reminiscent of quasiM{\"o}bius mappings. We give a dimensional invariant on the boundary that allows to distinguish hyperbolic symmetric spaces up to SBE, answering a question of Dru\c{t}u.;math.MG
1801.05165;Scattering and blow-up criteria for 3D cubic focusing nonlinear inhomogeneous NLS with a potential;In this paper, we consider the 3d cubic focusing inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a potential <br />$$ <br />iu_{t}+\Delta u-Vu+|x|^{-b}|u|^{2}u=0,\,\,(t,x) \in {{\bf{R}}\times{\bf{R}}^{3}}, <br />$$ <br />where $0&lt,b&lt,1$. We first establish global well-posedness and scattering for the radial initial data $u_{0}$ in $H^{1}({\bf R}^{3})$ satisfying $M(u_{0})^{1-s_{c}}E(u_{0})^{s_{c}}&lt,\mathcal{E}$ and $\|u_{0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2(1-s_{c})}\|H^{\frac{1}{2}}u_{0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2s_{c}}&lt,\mathcal{K}$ provided that $V$ is repulsive, where $\mathcal{E}$ and $\mathcal{K}$ are the mass-energy and mass-kinetic of the ground states, respectively. Our result extends the results of Hong \cite{H} and Farah-Guzm$\acute{\rm a}$n \cite{FG1} with $b\in(0,\frac12)$ to the case $0&lt,b&lt,1$. We then obtain a blow-up result for initial data $u_{0}$ in $H^{1}({\bf R}^{3})$ satisfying $M(u_{0})^{1-s_{c}}E(u_{0})^{s_{c}}&lt,\mathcal{E}$ and $\|u_{0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2(1-s_{c})}\|H^{\frac{1}{2}}u_{0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2s_{c}}&gt,\mathcal{K}$ if $V$ satisfies some additional assumptions.0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2(1-s_{c})}\|H^{\frac{1}{2}}u_{0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2s_{c}}&gt,\mathcal{K}$ if $V$ satisfies some additional assumptions.;math.AP
1801.05166;On Hamiltonian and Hamilton-connected digraphs;C. Thomassen in \cite{[11]} suggested (see also \cite{[2]}, J. C.Bermond, C. Thomassen, Cycles in Digraphs - A survey, J. Graph Theory 5 (1981) 1-43, Conjectures 1.6.7 and 1.6.8) the following conjectures : <br />1. Every 3-strongly connected digraph of order $n$ and with minimum degree at least $n+1$ is strongly Hamiltonian-connected. <br />2. Let $D$ be a 4-strongly connected digraph of order $n$ such that the sum of the degrees of any pair of non-adjacent vertices is at least $2n+1$.

1801.05169;A two-parameter eigenvalue problem for a class of block-operator matrices;We consider a symmetric block operator spectral problem with two spectral parameters. Under some reasonable restrictions, we state localisation theorems for the pair-eigenvalues and discuss relations to a class of non-self-adjoint spectral problems.;math.SP
1801.05176;The hypergeometric function for the root system of type $A$ with a certain degenerate parameter;We express explicitly the Heckman-Opdam hypergeometric function for the root system of type A with a certain degenerate parameter in terms of the Lauricella hypergeometric function.;math.RT
1801.05177;A theorem on even pancyclic bipartite digraphs;We prove that a strongly connected balanced bipartite directed graph of order $2a\geq 6$ with partite sets $X$ and $Y$ contains cycles of every length $2, 4, \ldots , 2a$, provided $d(x)+d(y)\geq 3a$ for every pair of vertices $x$, $y$ either both in $X$ or both in $Y$.;math.CO
1801.05179;A criterion for the uniform eventual positivity of operator semigroups;Consider a $C_0$-semigroup $(e^{tA})_{t \ge 0}$ on a function space or, more generally, on a Banach lattice $E$. We prove a sufficient criterion for the operators $e^{tA}$ to be positive for all sufficiently large times $t$, while the semigroup itself might not be positive. This complements recently established criteria for the individual orbits of the semigroup to become eventually positive for all positive initial values. We apply our main result to study the qualitative behaviour of the solutions to various partial differential equations.;math.FA
1801.05180;Stochastic grid bundling method for backward stochastic differential equations;In this work, we apply the Stochastic Grid Bundling Method (SGBM) to numerically solve backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). The SGBM algorithm is based on conditional expectations approximation by means of bundling of Monte Carlo sample paths and a local regress-later regression within each bundle. The basic algorithm for solving the backward stochastic differential equations will be introduced and an upper error bound is established for the local regression. A full error analysis is also conducted for the explicit version of our algorithm and numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate various properties of our algorithm.;math.NA
1801.05181;Nonexistence of proper $p$-biharmonic maps and Liouville type theorems I: case of $p\geq2$;Let $u: (M, g)\to (N, h)$ be a map between Riemannian manifolds $(M, g)$ and $(N, h)$. The $p$-bienergy of $u$ is defined by $E_p(u)=\int_M|\tau(u)|^pd\nu_g$, where $\tau(u)$ is the tension field of $u$ and $p&gt,1$. Critical points of $E_p(\cdot)$ are called $p$-biharmonic maps. In this paper we will prove nonexistence result of proper $p$-biharmonic maps when $p\geq2$. In particular when $M=\mathbb{R}^m$, we get Liouville type results under proper integral conditions , which extend the related results of Baird, Fardoun and Ouakkas \cite{BFO}.;math.DG
1801.05183;A note on the quantization of tensor fields and quantization of mechanical systems;This article continues and completes our previous work J. Phys. Commun. 2 (2018) 025007. We present two methods of quantization associated with a linear connection given on a differentiable manifold. One of these is that presented in the mentioned article. In the final section the equivalence between both methods is demonstrated, as a consequence of a remarkable property of the Riemannian exponential.;math-ph
1801.05187;Future directions in locally compact groups;This text is the preprint version of the concluding chapter for the book New Directions in Locally Compact Groups published by Cambridge University Press in the series Lecture Notes of the LMS. The recent progress on locally compact groups surveyed in that volume also reveals the considerable extent of the unexplored territories. Therefore, we wish to conclude it by mentioning a few open problems related to the material covered in the book and that we consider important at the time of this writing.;math.GR
1801.05189;On the Kernel of $\mathbb{Z}_{2^s}$-Linear Hadamard Codes;The $\mathbb{Z}_{2^s}$-additive codes are subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}^n_{2^s}$, and can be seen as a generalization of linear codes over $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$. A $\mathbb{Z}_{2^s}$-linear Hadamard code is a binary Hadamard code which is the Gray map image of a $\mathbb{Z}_{2^s}$-additive code. It is known that the dimension of the kernel can be used to give a complete classification of the $\mathbb{Z}_4$-linear Hadamard codes. In this paper, the kernel of $\mathbb{Z}_{2^s}$-linear Hadamard codes and its dimension are established for $s &gt, 2$. Moreover, we prove that this invariant only provides a complete classification for some values of $t$ and $s$. The exact amount of nonequivalent such codes are given up to $t=11$ for any $s\geq 2$, by using also the rank and, in some cases, further computations.;cs.IT
1801.05193;Some remark on the existence of infinitely many nonphysical solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations;We prove that there exist infinitely many distributional solutions with infinite kinetic energy to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $ \mathbb{R}^2 $. We prove as well the existence of infinitely many distributional solutions for Burgers equation in $ \mathbb{R} $.;math.AP
1801.05194;Sparsity Preserving Optimal Control of Discretized PDE Systems;We focus on the problem of optimal control of large-scale systems whose models are obtained by discretization of partial differential equations using the Finite Element (FE) or Finite Difference (FD) methods. The motivation for studying this pressing problem originates from the fact that the classical numerical tools used to solve low-dimensional optimal control problems are computationally infeasible for large-scale systems. Furthermore, although the matrices of large-scale FE or FD models are usually sparse banded or highly structured, the optimal control solution computed using the classical methods is dense and unstructured. Consequently, it is not suitable for efficient centralized and distributed real-time implementations. We show that the a priori (sparsity) patterns of the exact solutions of the generalized Lyapunov equations for FE and FD models are banded matrices. The a priori pattern predicts the dominant non-zero entries of the exact solution. We furthermore show that for well-conditioned problems, the a priori patterns are not only banded but also sparse matrices. On the basis of these results, we develop two computationally efficient methods for computing sparse approximate solutions of generalized Lyapunov equations. Using these two methods and the inexact Newton method, we show that the solution of the generalized Riccati equation can be approximated by a banded matrix. This enables us to develop a novel computationally efficient optimal control approach that is able to preserve the sparsity of the control law. We perform extensive numerical experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.;math.OC
1801.05195;Multicolour containers, extremal entropy and counting;In breakthrough results, Saxton-Thomason and Balogh-Morris-Samotij developed powerful theories of hypergraph containers. In this paper, we explore some consequences of these theories. We use a simple container theorem of Saxton-Thomason and an entropy-based framework to deduce container and counting theorems for hereditary properties of k-colourings of very general objects, which include both vertex- and edge-colourings of general hypergraph sequences as special cases. <br />In the case of sequences of complete graphs, we further derive characterisation and transference results for hereditary properties in terms of their stability families and extremal entropy. This covers within a unified framework a great variety of combinatorial structures, some of which had not previously been studied via containers: directed graphs, oriented graphs, tournaments, multigraphs with bounded multiplicity and multicoloured graphs amongst others. <br />Similar results were recently and independently obtained by Terry.;math.CO
1801.05197;A note on the cross-index of a complete graph based on a linear tree;In this paper it is shown that a complete graph with $n$ vertices has an optimal diagram, i.e., a diagram whose crossing number equals the value of Guy's formula, with a free maximal linear tree and without free hamiltonian cycles for any odd integer $n \ge 7$.;math.GT
1801.05199;The Fermi-Pasta-Ulam problem and its underlying integrable dynamics: an approach through Lyapunov Exponents;FPU models, in dimension one, are perturbations either of the linear model or of the Toda model, perturbations of the linear model include the usual $\beta$-model, perturbations of Toda include the usual $\alpha+\beta$ model. In this paper we explore and compare two families, or hierarchies, of FPU models, closer and closer to either the linear or the Toda model, by computing numerically, for each model, the maximal Lyapunov exponent $\chi$. We study the asymptotics of $\chi$ for large $N$ (the number of particles) and small $\epsilon$ (the specific energy $E/N$), and find, for all models, asymptotic power laws $\chi\simeq C\epsilon^a$, $C$ and $a$ depending on the model. The asymptotics turns out to be, in general, rather slow, and producing accurate results requires a great computational effort. We also revisit and extend the analytic computation of $\chi$ introduced by Casetti, Livi and Pettini, originally formulated for the $\beta$-model. With great evidence the theory extends successfully to all models of the linear hierarchy, but not to models close to Toda.;math.DS
1801.05201;Scaling Laws and Warning Signs for Bifurcations of SPDEs;Critical transitions (or tipping points) are drastic sudden changes observed in many dynamical systems. Large classes of critical transitions are associated to systems, which drift slowly towards a bifurcation point. In the context of stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs), there are results on growth of variance and autocorrelation before a transition, which can be used as possible warning signs in applications. A similar theory has recently been developed in the simplest setting also for stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) for self-adjoint operators in the drift term. This setting leads to real discrete spectrum and growth of the covariance operator via a certain scaling law. In this paper, we develop this theory substantially further. We cover the cases of complex eigenvalues, degenerate eigenvalues as well as continuous spectrum. This provides a fairly comprehensive theory for most practical applications of warning signs for SPDE bifurcations.;math.DS
1801.05203;Forward-Invariance and Wong-Zakai Approximation for Stochastic Moving Boundary Problems;We discuss a class of stochastic second-order PDEs in one space-dimension with an inner boundary moving according to a possibly non-linear, Stefan-type condition. We show that proper separation of phases is attained, i.e., the solution remains negative on one side and positive on the other side of the moving interface, when started with the appropriate initial conditions. To extend results from deterministic settings to the stochastic case, we establish a Wong-Zakai type approximation. After a coordinate transformation the problems are reformulated and analysed in terms of stochastic evolution equations on domains of fractional powers of linear operators.;math.PR
1801.05209;Normal subgroups of the braid group and the metaconjecture of Ivanov;We show that many normal subgroups of the braid group modulo its centre, and of the mapping class group of a sphere with marked points, have the property that their automorphism and abstract commensurator groups are mapping class groups of such spheres. As one application, we establish the automorphism groups of each term in the lower central series and derived series of the pure braid group. We also obtain new proofs of results of Dyer-Grossman and Orevkov, showing that the automorphism groups of the braid group and of its commutator subgroup are isomorphic. We then calculate the automorphism and abstract commensurator groups of each term in the hyperelliptic Johnson filtration, recovering a result of Childers for the Torelli case. The techniques used in the paper rely on resolving a metaconjecture of Nikolai V. Ivanov for "graphs of regions", extending work of Brendle-Margalit.;math.GT
1801.05210;Enabling Quality-Driven Scalable Video Transmission over Multi-User NOMA System;Recently, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been proposed to achieve higher spectral efficiency over conventional orthogonal multiple access. Although it has the potential to meet increasing demands of video services, it is still challenging to provide high performance video streaming. In this research, we investigate, for the first time, a multi-user NOMA system design for video transmission. Various NOMA systems have been proposed for data transmission in terms of throughput or reliability. However, the perceived quality, or the quality-of-experience of users, is more critical for video transmission. Based on this observation, we design a quality-driven scalable video transmission framework with cross-layer support for multi-user NOMA. To enable low complexity multi-user NOMA operations, a novel user grouping strategy is proposed. The key features in the proposed framework include the integration of the quality model for encoded video with the physical layer model for NOMA transmission, and the formulation of multi-user NOMA-based video transmission as a quality-driven power allocation problem. As the problem is non-concave, a global optimal algorithm based on the hidden monotonic property and a suboptimal algorithm with polynomial time complexity are developed. Simulation results show that the proposed multi-user NOMA system outperforms existing schemes in various video delivery scenarios.;cs.IT
1801.05213;Frames of translates for model sets;We study spanning properties of a family of functions translated along simple model sets. We characterize tight frame and dual frame generators for such irregular translates and we apply the results to Gabor systems. We use the connection between model sets and almost periodic functions and rely strongly on a Poisson summations formula for model sets to introduce the so-called bracket product, which then plays a crucial role in our approach. As a corollary to our main results we obtain a density statement for semi-regular Gabor frames.;math.FA
1801.05214;The nonlinear Brascamp-Lieb inequality for simple data;We establish a nonlinear generalisation of the classical Brascamp-Lieb inequality in the case where the Lebesgue exponents lie in the interior of the finiteness polytope. As a corollary we show that the best constant in Young's convolution inequality in a small neighbourhood of the identity of a general Lie group, approaches the euclidean constant as the size of the neighbourhood approaches zero, answering a question of Cowling, Martini, M\"uller and Parcet. Our proof consists of running an efficient, or "tight", induction on scales argument which uses the existence of gaussian extremisers to the underlying linear Brascamp-Lieb inequality in a fundamental way.;math.CA
1801.05221;A fast subspace optimization method for nonlinear inverse problems in Banach spaces with an application in parameter identification;We introduce and analyze a fast iterative method based on sequential Bregman projections for nonlinear inverse problems in Banach spaces. The key idea, in contrast to the standard Landweber method, is to use multiple search directions per iteration in combination with a regulation of the step width in order to reduce the total number of iterations. This method is suitable for both exact and noisy data. In the latter case, we obtain a regularization method. An algorithm with two search directions is used for the numerical identification of a parameter in an elliptic boundary value problem.;math.NA
1801.05224;Device-to-Device Aided Multicasting;We consider a device-to-device (D2D) aided multicast channel, where a transmitter wishes to convey a common message to many receivers and these receivers cooperate with each other. We propose a simple computationally efficient scheme requiring only statistical channel knowledge at transmitter. Our analysis in general topologies reveals that, when the number of receivers $K$ grows to infinity, the proposed scheme guarantees a multicast rate of ${1 \over 2} \log_2(1 + \beta \ln K )$ with high probability for any $\beta &lt, \beta^\star$ where $\beta^\star$ depends on the network topology. This scheme undergoes a phase transition at threshold $\beta^\star \ln K$ where transmissions are successful/unsuccessful with high probability when the SNR is above/below this threshold. We also analyze the outage rate of the proposed scheme in the same setting.;cs.IT
1801.05227;A Survey of Physical Layer Security Techniques for 5G Wireless Networks and Challenges Ahead;Physical layer security which safeguards data confidentiality based on the information-theoretic approaches has received significant research interest recently. The key idea behind physical layer security is to utilize the intrinsic randomness of the transmission channel to guarantee the security in physical layer. The evolution towards 5G wireless communications poses new challenges for physical layer security research. This paper provides a latest survey of the physical layer security research on various promising 5G technologies, including physical layer security coding, massive multiple-input multiple-output, millimeter wave communications, heterogeneous networks, non-orthogonal multiple access, full duplex technology, etc. Technical challenges which remain unresolved at the time of writing are summarized and the future trends of physical layer security in 5G and beyond are discussed.;cs.IT
1801.05240;de Finetti reductions for partially exchangeable probability distributions;We introduce a general framework for de Finetti reduction results, applicable to various notions of partially exchangeable probability distributions. Explicit statements are derived for the cases of exchangeability, Markov exchangeability, and some generalizations of these. Our techniques are combinatorial and rely on the "BEST" theorem, enumerating the Eulerian cycles of a multigraph.;math.PR
1801.05246;Isospectral discrete and quantum graphs with the same flip counts and nodal counts;The existence of non-isomorphic graphs which share the same Laplace spectrum (to be referred to as isospectral graphs) leads naturally to the following question: What additional information is required in order to resolve isospectral graphs? It was suggested by Band, Shapira and Smilansky that this might be achieved by either counting the number of nodal domains or the number of times the eigenfunctions change sign (the so-called flip count). Recently examples of (discrete) isospectral graphs with the same flip count and nodal count have been constructed by K. Ammann by utilising Godsil-McKay switching. Here we provide a simple alternative mechanism that produces systematic examples of both discrete and quantum isospectral graphs with the same flip and nodal counts.;math-ph
1801.05249;Regularity of weak solutions and supersolutions to the porous medium equation;We study the relations between different regularity assumptions in the definition of weak solutions and supersolutions to the porous medium equation. In particular, we establish the equivalence of the conditions $u^m \in L^2_{\rm loc}(0,T,H^1_{\rm loc}(\Omega))$ and $u^\frac{m+1}2 \in L^2_{\rm loc}(0,T,H^1_{\rm loc}(\Omega))$ in the definition of weak solutions. Our proof is based on approximation by solutions to obstacle problems.;math.AP
1801.05251;Simplified Versions of the Conditional Gradient Method;We suggest simple modifications of the conditional gradient method for smooth optimization problems, which maintain the basic convergence properties, but reduce the implementation cost of each iteration essentially. Namely, we propose the step-size procedure without any line-search, and inexact solution of the direction finding subproblem. Preliminary results of computational tests confirm efficiency of the proposed modifications.;math.OC
1801.05252;A probabilistic proof of Perron&#x27,s theorem;We present an alternative proof of Perron's theorem, which is probabilistic in nature. It rests on the representation of the Perron eigenvector as a functional of the trajectory of an auxiliary Markov chain.;math.PR
1801.05253;A new characterization of endogeny;Aldous and Bandyopadhyay have shown that each solution to a recursive distributional equation (RDE) gives rise to recursive tree process (RTP), which is a sort of Markov chain in which time has a tree-like structure and in which the state of each vertex is a random function of its descendants. If the state at the root is measurable with respect to the sigma field generated by the random functions attached to all vertices, then the RTP is said to be endogenous. For RTPs defined by continuous maps, Aldous and Bandyopadhyay showed that endogeny is equivalent to bivariate uniqueness, and they asked if the continuity hypothesis can be removed. We introduce a higher-level RDE that through its $n$-th moment measures contains all $n$-variate RDEs. We show that this higher-level RDE has minimal and maximal fixed points with respect to the convex order, and that these coincide if and only if the corresponding RTP is endogenous. As a side result, this allows us to answer the question of Aldous and Bandyopadhyay positively.;math.PR
1801.05256;Centralizers of normal subsystems revisited;In this paper we revisit two concepts which were originally introduced by Aschbacher and are crucial in the theory of saturated fusion systems: Firstly, we give a new approach to defining the centralizer of a normal subsystem. Secondly, we revisit the construction of the product of two normal subsystems which centralize each other.;math.GR
1801.05257;Conics, Twistors, and anti-self-dual tri-K&#xe4,hler metrics;We describe the range of the Radon transform on the space $M$ of irreducible conics in $\CP^2$ in terms of natural differential operators associated to the $SO(3)$-structure on $M=SL(3, \R)/SO(3)$ and its complexification. Following \cite{moraru} we show that for any function $F$ in this range, the zero locus of $F$ is a four-manifold admitting an anti-self-dual conformal structure which contains three different scalar-flat K\"ahler metrics. The corresponding twistor space ${\mathcal Z}$ admits a holomorphic fibration over $\CP^2$. In the special case where ${\mathcal Z}=\CP^3\setminus\CP^1$ the twistor lines project down to a four-parameter family of conics which form triangular Poncelet pairs with a fixed base conic.;math.DG
1801.05259;Hamiltonian partial differential equations and symplectic scale manifolds;This paper defines symplectic scale manifolds based on Hofer-Wysocki-Zehnder's scale calculus. We introduce Hamiltonian vector fields and flows on these by narrowing down sc-smoothness to what we denote by strong sc-smoothness, a concept which effectively formalizes the desired smoothness properties for Hamiltonian functions. We show the concept to be invariant under sc-smooth symplectomorphisms, whence it is compatible with Hofer's scale manifolds. We develop and verify the theory at the hand of the free Schr\"odinger equation.;math.SG
1801.05261;Operators with Wentzell boundary conditions and the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator;In this paper we relate the generator property of an operator $A$ with (abstract) generalized Wentzell boundary conditions on a Banach space $X$ and its associated (abstract) Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator $N$ acting on a "boundary" space $\partial X$. Our approach is based on similarity transformations and perturbation arguments and allows to split $A$ into an operator $A_{00}$ with Dirichlet-type boundary conditions on a space $X_0$ of states having "zero trace" and the operator $N$. If $A_{00}$ generates an analytic semigroup, we obtain under a weak Hille--Yosida type condition that $A$ generates an analytic semigroup on $X$ if and only if $N$ does so on $\partial X$. Here we assume that the (abstract) "trace" operator $L:X\to\partial X$ is bounded what is typically satisfied if $X$ is a space of continuous functions. Concrete applications are made to various second order differential operators.;math.FA
1801.05262;Root number of the twists of an elliptic curve;We give an explicit description of the behaviour of the root number in the family given by twists of an elliptic curve $E$ by the rational values of a polynomial $f(T)$. In particular, we give a criterion (on $f$ depending on $E$) for the family to have a constant root number over $\mathbb{Q}$. This completes a work of Rohrlich: we detail the behaviour of the root number when $E$ has bad reduction over $\mathbb{Q}^{ab}$ and we treat the cases $j(E)=0,1728$ which were not considered previously.;math.NT
1801.05263;Maximum principles at infinity and the Ahlfors-Khas&#x27,minskii duality: an overview;This note is meant to introduce the reader to a duality principle for nonlinear equations that recently appeared in the literature. Motivations come from the desire to give a unifying potential-theoretic framework for various maximum principles at infinity appearing in the literature (Ekeland, Omori-Yau, Pigola-Rigoli-Setti), as well as to describe their interplay with properties coming from stochastic analysis on manifolds. The duality involves an appropriate version of these principles formulated for viscosity subsolutions of fully nonlinear inequalities, called the Ahlfors property, and the existence of suitable exhaustion functions called Khas'minskii potentials. We discuss applications, also involving the geometry of submanifolds, in the last sections, as well as the stability of these maximum principles when we remove polar sets.;math.DG
1801.05265;Robust sustainable development assessment with composite indices aggregating interacting dimensions: the hierarchical-SMAA-Choquet integral approach;The evaluation of sustainable development - and, in particular, rural development - through composite indices requires taking into account a plurality of indicators, which are related to economic, social and environmental aspects. The points of view evaluated by these indices are naturally interacting: thus, a bonus has to be recognized to units performing well on synergic criteria, whereas a penalization has to be assigned on redundant criteria. An additional difficulty of the modelization is the elicitation of the parameters for the composite indices, since they are typically affected by some imprecision. In most approaches, all these critical points are usually neglected, which in turn yields an unpleasant degree of approximation in the computation of indices. In this paper we propose a methodology that allows one to simultaneously handle these delicate issues. Specifically, to take into account synergy and redundancy between criteria, we suitably aggregate indicators by means of the Choquet integral. Further, to obtain recommendations that take into account the space of fluctuation related to imprecision in nonadditive weights (capacity of the Choquet integral), we adopt the Robust Ordinal Regression (ROR) and the Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA). Finally, to study sustainability not only at a comprehensive level (taking into account all criteria) but also at a local level (separately taking into account economic, social and environmental aspects), we apply the Multiple Criteria Hierarchy Process (MCHP). We illustrate the advantages of our approach in a concrete example, in which we measure the rural sustainability of 51 municipalities in the province of Catania, the largest city of the East Coast of Sicily (Italy).;math.OC
1801.05271;On Some Linear Codes;Linear code with complementary dual($LCD$) are those codes which meet their duals trivially. In this paper we will give rather alternative proof of Massey's theorem\cite{Massey2}, which is one of the most important characterization of $LCD$ codes. Let $LCD[n,k]_3$ denote the maximum of possible values of $d$ among $[n,k,d]$ ternary codes. We will give bound on $LCD[n,k]_3$. We will also discuss the cases when this bound is attained.;cs.IT
1801.05274;Fractional velocity as a tool for the study of non-linear problems;Singular functions and, in general, H\"older functions represent conceptual models of nonlinear physical phenomena. The purpose of this survey is to demonstrate the applicability of fractional velocity as a tool to characterize Holder and in particular singular functions. Fractional velocities are defined as limit of the difference quotient of a fractional power and they generalize the local notion of a derivative. On the other hand, their properties contrast some of the usual properties of derivatives. One of the most peculiar properties of these operators is that the set of their non trivial values is disconnected. This can be used for example to model instantaneous interactions, for example Langevin dynamics. Examples are given by the De Rham and Neidinger's functions, represented by iterative function systems. Finally the conditions for equivalence with the Kolwankar-Gangal local fractional derivative are investigated.;math.CA
1801.05275;Two-weight, weak type norm inequalities for fractional integral operators and commutators on weighted Morrey and amalgam spaces;Let $0&lt,\gamma&lt,n$ and $I_\gamma$ be the fractional integral operator of order $\gamma$, $I_{\gamma}f(x)=\int_{\mathbb R^n}|x-y|^{\gamma-n}f(y)\,dy$, and let $[b,I_\gamma]$ be the linear commutator generated by a symbol function $b$ and $I_\gamma$, $[b,I_{\gamma}]f(x)=b(x)\cdot I_{\gamma}f(x)-I_\gamma(bf)(x)$. This paper is concerned with two-weight, weak type norm estimates for such operators on the weighted Morrey and amalgam spaces. Based on weak-type norm inequalities on weighted Lebesgue spaces and certain $A_p$-type conditions on pairs of weights, we can establish the weak-type norm inequalities for fractional integral operator $I_{\gamma}$ as well as the corresponding commutator in the framework of weighted Morrey and amalgam spaces.

1801.05282;Some Extremal Values of the Number of Congruences of a Finite Lattice;We study the smallest, as well as the largest numbers of congruences of lattices of an arbitrary finite cardinality $n$. Continuing the work of Freese and Cz\' edli, we prove that the third, fourth and fifth largest numbers of congruences of an $n$--element lattice are: $5\cdot 2^{n-5}$ if $n\geq 5$, respectively $2^{n-3}$ and $7\cdot 2^{n-6}$ if $n\geq 6$. We also determine the structures of the $n$--element lattices having $5\cdot 2^{n-5}$, respectively $2^{n-3}$ congruences, along with the structures of their congruence lattices.;math.RA

1801.05294;Bounds on the Effective-length of Optimal Codes for Interference Channel with Feedback;In this paper, we investigate the necessity of finite blocklength codes in distributed transmission of independent message sets over channels with feedback. Previously, it was shown that finite effective length codes are necessary in distributed transmission and compression of sources. We provide two examples of three user interference channels with feedback where codes with asymptotically large effective lengths are sub-optimal. As a result, we conclude that coded transmission using finite effective length codes is necessary to achieve optimality. We argue that the sub-optimal performance of large effective length codes is due to their inefficiency in preserving the correlation between the inputs to the distributed terminals in the communication system. This correlation is made available by the presence of feedback at the terminals and is used as a means for coordination between the terminals when using finite effective length coding strategies.;cs.IT
1801.05296;Spatial nonhomogeneous periodic solutions induced by nonlocal prey competition in a diffusive predator-prey model;The diffusive Holling-Tanner predator-prey model with no-flux boundary conditions and nonlocal prey competition is considered in this paper. We show the existence of spatial nonhomogeneous periodic solutions, which is induced by nonlocal prey competition. In particular, the constant positive steady state can lose the stability through Hopf bifurcation when the given parameter passes through some critical values, and the bifurcating periodic solutions near such values can be spatially nonhomogeneous and orbitally asymptotically stable. This phenomenon is different from that in models without nonlocal effect.;math.DS
1801.05300;An Extension of the Beurling-Chen-Hadwin-Shen Theorem for Noncommutative Hardy Spaces Associated with Finite von Neumann Algebras;In 2015, Yanni Chen, Don Hadwin and Junhao Shen proved a noncommutative version of Beurling's theorems for a continuous unitarily invariant norm $% \alpha $ on a tracial von Neumann algebra $\left( \mathcal{M},\tau \right) $ where $\alpha $ is $\left\Vert \cdot \right\Vert _{1}$-dominating with respect to $\tau $. In the paper, we first define a class of norms $% N_{\Delta }\left( \mathcal{M},\tau \right) $ on $\mathcal{M}$, called determinant, normalized, unitarily invariant continuous norms on $\mathcal{M}$. If $\alpha \in N_{\Delta }\left( \mathcal{M},\tau \right) $, then there exists a faithful normal tracial state $\rho $ on $\mathcal{M}$ such that $\rho \left( x\right) =\tau \left( xg\right) $ for some positive $g\in L^{1}\left( \mathcal{Z},\tau \right) $ and the determinant of $g$ is positive. For every $\alpha \in N_{\Delta }\left( \mathcal{M},\tau \right) $, we study the noncommutative Hardy spaces $% H^{\alpha }\left( \mathcal{M},\tau \right) $, then prove that the Chen-Hadwin-Shen theorem holds for $L^{\alpha }\left( \mathcal{M},\tau \right) $. The key ingredients in the proof of our result include a factorization theorem and a density theorem for $L^{\alpha }\left( \mathcal{M},\rho \right) $.;math.OA
1801.05303;Limit Drift for Complex Feigenbaum Mappings;We study the dynamics of towers defined by fixed points of renormalization for Feigenbaum polynomials in the complex plane with varying order \ell of the critical point. It is known that the measure of the Julia set of the Feigenbaum polynomial is positive if and only if almost every point tends to 0 under the dynamics of the tower for corresponding \ell. That in turn depends on the sign of a quantity called the drift. We prove the existence and key properties of absolutely continuous invariant measures for tower dynamics as well as their convergence when \ell tends to infinity. We also prove the convergence of the drifts to a finite limit which can be expressed purely in terms of the limiting tower which corresponds to a Feigenbaum map with a flat critical point;math.DS
1801.05306;On strong homogeneity of a class of global optimization algorithms working with infinite and infinitesimal scales;The necessity to find the global optimum of multiextremal functions arises in many applied problems where finding local solutions is insufficient. One of the desirable properties of global optimization methods is \emph{strong homogeneity} meaning that a method produces the same sequences of points where the objective function is evaluated independently both of multiplication of the function by a scaling constant and of adding a shifting constant. In this paper, several aspects of global optimization using strongly homogeneous methods are considered. First, it is shown that even if a method possesses this property theoretically, numerically very small and large scaling constants can lead to ill-conditioning of the scaled problem. Second, a new class of global optimization problems where the objective function can have not only finite but also infinite or infinitesimal Lipschitz constants is introduced. Third, the strong homogeneity of several Lipschitz global optimization algorithms is studied in the framework of the Infinity Computing paradigm allowing one to work \emph{numerically} with a variety of infinities and infinitesimals. Fourth, it is proved that a class of efficient univariate methods enjoys this property for finite, infinite and infinitesimal scaling and shifting constants. Finally, it is shown that in certain cases the usage of numerical infinities and infinitesimals can avoid ill-conditioning produced by scaling. Numerical experiments illustrating theoretical results are described.;math.OC
1801.05308;Some binomial formulas for non-commuting operators;Let $D$ and $U$ be linear operators in a vector space (or more generally, elements of an associative algebra with a unit). We establish binomial-type identities for $D$ and $U$ assuming that either their commutator $[D,U]$ or the second commutator $[D,[D,U]]$ is proportional to $U$. <br />Operators $D=d/dx$ (differentiation) and $U$- multiplication by $e^{\lambda x}$ or by $\sin \lambda x$ are basic examples, for which some of these relations appeared unexpectedly as byproducts of an authors' previous medical imaging research.;math.CA
1801.05310;Parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis model with space-time dependent logistic sources on $\mathbb{R}^N$. II. Existence, uniqueness, and stability of strictly positive entire solutions;This work is the second of the series of three papers devoted to the study of asymptotic dynamics in the chemotaxis system with space and time dependent logistic source,$$\partial_tu=\Delta u-\chi\nabla\cdot(u\nabla v)+u(a(x,t)-ub(x,t)),\quad 0=\Delta v-\lambda v+\mu u ,\ x\in\mathbb{R}^N, \ (1) $$where $N\ge1$ is a positive integer, $\chi,\lambda,\mu&gt,0$, and the functions $a(x,t), b(x,t)$ are positive and bounded. In the first of the series, we studied the phenomena of pointwise and uniform persistence, and asymptotic spreading for solutions with compactly supported or front like initials. In the second of the series, we investigate the existence, uniqueness and stability of strictly positive entire solutions. In this direction, we prove that, if $0\le\mu\chi&lt,b_\inf$, then (1) has a strictly positive entire solution, which is time-periodic (respectively time homogeneous) when the logistic source function is time-periodic (respectively time homogeneous). Next, we show that there is positive constant $\chi_0$, such that for every $0\le\chi&lt,\chi_0$, (1) has a unique positive entire solution which is uniform and exponentially stable with respect to strictly positive perturbations. In particular, we prove that $\chi_0$ can be taken to be $b_\inf/2\mu$ when the logistic source function is either space homogeneous or the function $b(x,t)/a(x,t)$ is constant. We also investigate the disturbances to Fisher-KKP dynamics caused by chemotatic effects, and prove that$$\sup_{0&lt,\chi\le\chi_1}\sup_{t_0\in\mathbb{R},t\ge 0}\frac{1}{\chi}\|u_{\chi}(\cdot,t+t_0,t_0,u_0)-u_0(\cdot,t+t_0,t_0,u_0)\|_{\infty}&lt,\infty$$for every $0&lt,\chi_1&lt,b_\inf/\mu$ and every uniformly continuous initial function $u_0$, with $u_{0\inf}&gt,0$, where $(u_\chi(x,t+t_0,t_0,u_0),v_\chi(x,t+t_0,t_0,u_0))$ denotes the unique classical solution of (1) with $u_\chi(x,t_0,t_0,u_0)=u_0(x)$, for every $0\le\chi&lt,b_\inf$.;math.AP
1801.05315;Quasi-Mobius Homeomorphisms of Morse boundaries;The Morse boundary of a proper geodesic metric space is designed to encode hypberbolic-like behavior in the space. A key property of this boundary is that a quasi-isometry between two such spaces induces a homeomorphism on their Morse boundaries. In this paper we investigate when the converse holds. We prove that for $X, Y$ proper, cocompact spaces, a homeomorphism between their Morse boundaries is induced by a quasi-isometry if and only if the homeomorphism is quasi-mobius and 2-stable.;math.GT
1801.05318;Matching, Path Covers, and Total Forcing Sets;A dynamic coloring of the vertices of a graph $G$ starts with an initial subset $S$ of colored vertices, with all remaining vertices being non-colored. At each discrete time interval, a colored vertex with exactly one non-colored neighbor forces this non-colored neighbor to be colored. The initial set $S$ is called a forcing set of $G$ if, by iteratively applying the forcing process, every vertex in $G$ becomes colored. If the initial set $S$ has the added property that it induces a subgraph of $G$ without isolated vertices, then $S$ is called a total forcing set in $G$. The minimum cardinality of a total forcing set in $G$ is its total forcing number, denoted $F_t(G)$. The path cover number of $G$, denoted $\pc(G)$, is the minimum number of vertex disjoint paths such that every vertex belongs to a path in the cover, while the matching number of $G$, denoted $\alpha'(T)$, is the number of edges in a maximum matching of $G$. Let $T$ be a tree of order at least two. We observe that $\pc(T) + 1 \le F_t(T) \le 2\pc(T)$, and we prove that $F_t(T) \le \alpha'(T) + \pc(T)$. Further, we characterize the extremal trees achieving equality in these bounds.;math.CO
1801.05319;Perverse schobers on Riemann surfaces: constructions and examples;This note studies perverse sheaves of categories, or schobers, on Riemann surfaces, following ideas of Kapranov and Schechtman. For certain wall crossings in geometric invariant theory, I construct a schober on the complex plane, singular at each imaginary integer. I use this to obtain schobers for standard flops: in the 3-fold case, I relate these to a further schober on a partial compactification of a stringy Kaehler moduli space, and suggest an application to mirror symmetry.;math.AG
1801.05320;Presentations of parabolics in some elementary Chevalley-Demazure groups;Given a universal elementary Chevalley-Demazure group $E_\Phi^{sc}(R)$ for which its (standard) parabolic subgroups are finitely generated, we consider the problem of classifying which parabolics $P(R) \subset E_\Phi^{sc}(R)$ are finitely presented. We show that, under mild assumptions, this is equivalent to the finite presentability of a suitable retract of $P$ which contains the Levi factor. If the base ring $R$ is a Dedekind domain of arithmetic type, we combine our results with well-known theorems due to Borel-Serre, Abels, Behr and Bux to give a partial classification of finitely presentable $S$-arithmetic subgroups of parabolics in split reductive linear algebraic groups.;math.GR

Then we study the existence of group nonexpansive retractions $P_{i}$ from $C$ onto $\text{Fix}(\mathcal{S})$ such that $P_{i}T_{i} = T_{i}P_{i} = P_{i}$.;math.FA

1801.05326;On volumes of hyperideal tetrahedra with constrained edge lengths;Hyperideal tetrahedra are the fundamental building blocks of hyperbolic 3-manifolds with geodesic boundary. The study of their geometric properties (in particular, of their volume) has applications also in other areas of low-dimensional topology, like the computation of quantum invariants of 3-manifolds and the use of variational methods in the study of circle packings on surfaces. <br />The Schl\"afli formula neatly describes the behaviour of the volume of hyperideal tetrahedra with respect to dihedral angles, while the dependence of volume on edge lengths is worse understood. In this paper we prove that, for every $\ell&lt,\ell_0$, where $\ell_0$ is an explicit constant, regular hyperideal tetrahedra of edge length $\ell$ maximize the volume among hyperideal tetrahedra whose edge lengths are all not smaller than $\ell$. <br />This result provides a fundamental step in the computation of the ideal simplicial volume of an infinite family of hyperbolic 3-manifolds with geodesic boundary.;math.GT

Over larger alphabets, we give some candidates for balanced words (found computationally) having small critical exponents. We also explore a method for proving these results using the automated theorem prover Walnut.;math.CO
1801.05335;Rates in almost sure invariance principle for slowly mixing dynamical systems;We prove the one-dimensional almost sure invariance principle with essentially optimal rates for slowly (polynomially) mixing deterministic dynamical systems, such as Pomeau-Manneville intermittent maps, with H\"older continuous observables. Our rates have form $o(n^\gamma L(n))$, where $L(n)$ is a slowly varying function and $\gamma$ is determined by the speed of mixing. We strongly improve previous results where the best available rates did not exceed $O(n^{1/4})$. To break the $O(n^{1/4})$ barrier, we represent the dynamics as a Young-tower-like Markov chain and adapt the methods of Berkes-Liu-Wu and Cuny-Dedecker-Merlev\`ede on the Koml\'os-Major-Tusn\'ady approximation for dependent processes.;math.DS

1801.05338;Decision-Feedback Detection Strategy for Nonlinear Frequency-Division Multiplexing;By exploiting a causality property of the nonlinear Fourier transform, a novel decision-feedback detection strategy for nonlinear frequency-division multiplexing (NFDM) systems is introduced. The performance of the proposed strategy is investigated both by simulations and by theoretical bounds and approximations, showing that it achieves a considerable performance improvement compared to previously adopted techniques in terms of Q-factor. The obtained improvement demonstrates that, by tailoring the detection strategy to the peculiar properties of the nonlinear Fourier transform, it is possible to boost the performance of NFDM systems and overcome current limitations imposed by the use of more conventional detection techniques suitable for the linear regime.;cs.IT

1801.05347;Mathematical foundations of Accelerated Molecular Dynamics methods;The objective of this review article is to present recent results on the mathematical analysis of the Accelerated Dynamics algorithms introduced by A.F. Voter in collaboration with D. Perez and M. Sorensen. Using the notion of quasi-stationary distribution, one is able to rigorously justify the fact that the exit event from a metastable state for the Langevin or overdamped Langevin dynamics can be modeled by a kinetic Monte Carlo model. Moreover, under some geometric assumptions, one can prove that this kinetic Monte Carlo model can be parameterized using Eyring-Kramers formulas. These are the building blocks required to analyze the Accelerated Dynamics algorithms, to understand their efficiency and their accuracy, and to improve and generalize these techniques beyond their original scope.;math.NA
1801.05349;Joint CSI Estimation, Beamforming and Scheduling Design for Wideband Massive MIMO System;This paper proposes a novel approach for designing channel estimation, beamforming and scheduling jointly for wideband massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. With the proposed approach, we first quantify the maximum number of user equipments (UEs) that can send pilots which may or may not be orthogonal. Specifically, when the channel has a maximum of $L$ multipath taps, and we allocate $\tilde{M}$ sub-carriers for the channel state information (CSI) estimation, a maximum of $\tilde{M}$ UEs CSI can be estimated ($L$ times compared to the conventional CSI estimation approach) in a massive MIMO regime. Then, we propose to schedule a subset of these UEs using greedy based scheduling to transmit their data on each sub-carrier with the proposed joint beamforming and scheduling design. We employ the well known maximum ratio combiner (MRC) beamforming approach in the uplink channel data transmission. All the analytical expressions are validated via numerical results, and the superiority of the proposed design over the conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission approach is demonstrated using extensive numerical simulations in the long term evolution (LTE) channel environment. The proposed channel estimation and beamforming design is linear and simple to implement.;cs.IT
1801.05355;A Local-global principle for isogenies of composite degree;Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over a number field $K$. If for almost all primes of $K$, the reduction of $E$ modulo that prime has rational cyclic isogeny of fixed degree, we can ask if this forces $E$ to have a cyclic isogeny of that degree over $K$. Building upon the work of Sutherland, Anni, and Banwait-Cremona in the case of prime degree, we consider this question for cyclic isogenies of arbitrary degree.;math.NT

1801.05362;Minimax Optimal Additive Functional Estimation with Discrete Distribution: Slow Divergence Speed Case;This paper addresses an estimation problem of an additive functional of $\phi$, which is defined as $\theta(P,\phi)=\sum_{i=1}^k\phi(p_i)$, given $n$ i.i.d. random samples drawn from a discrete distribution $P=(p_1,...,p_k)$ with alphabet size $k$. We have revealed in the previous paper that the minimax optimal rate of this problem is characterized by the divergence speed of the fourth derivative of $\phi$ in a range of fast divergence speed. In this paper, we prove this fact for a more general range of the divergence speed. As a result, we show the minimax optimal rate of the additive functional estimation for each range of the parameter $\alpha$ of the divergence speed. For $\alpha \in (1,3/2)$, we show that the minimax rate is $\frac{1}{n}+\frac{k^2}{(n\ln n)^{2\alpha}}$. Besides, we show that the minimax rate is $\frac{1}{n}$ for $\alpha \in [3/2,2]$.;cs.IT
1801.05364;An existence result and evolutionary $&#x393,$-convergence for perturbed gradient systems;The initial-value problem for the perturbed gradient flow \[ <br />B(t,u(t)) \in \partial\Psi_{u(t)}(u'(t))+\partial \mathcal E_t(u(t)) \text{ for a.a. } t\in (0,T),\qquad u(0)=u_0 \] with a perturbation $B$ in a Banach space $V$ is investigated, where the dissipation potential $\Psi_u: V\rightarrow [0,+\infty)$ and the energy functional $\mathcal E_t:V\rightarrow (-\infty,+\infty]$ are nonsmooth and supposed to be convex and nonconvex, respectively. The perturbation $B:[0,T]\times V \rightarrow V^*, (t,v)\mapsto B(t,v)$ is assumed to be continuous and satisfies a growth condition. Under additional assumptions on the dissipation potential and the energy functional, existence of strong solutions is shown by proving convergence of a semi-implicit discretization scheme with a variational approximation technique.;math-ph

Simple finite dimensional $\mathcal{A}$-modules are classified, finite dimensional weight modules are shown to be semisimple, $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathcal{A})$ is computed, and the prime spectrum of $\mathcal{A}$ is computed along with its Zariski topology. Finally, it is shown that $\mathcal{A}$ satisfies the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence.;math.QA
1801.05370;Relativistic Lippmann - Schwinger equation;The classical Lippmann-Schwinger equation plays an important role in the scattering theory (non-relativistic case, Schr\"odinger equation). In the present paper we consider the relativistic analogue of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. We represent the corresponding equation in the integral form. Using this integral equation we investigate the stationary scattering problems (relativistic case, Dirac equation). We consider the dynamical scattering problems (relativistic case, Dirac equation) as well.;math-ph

1801.05375;A note on Harris&#x27, ergodic theorem, controllability and perturbations of harmonic networks;We show that elements of control theory, together with an application of Harris' ergodic theorem, provide an alternate method for showing exponential convergence to a unique stationary measure for certain classes of networks of quasi-harmonic classical oscillators coupled to heat baths. With the system of oscillators expressed in the form $\mathrm{d} X_t = A X_t \,\mathrm{d} t + F(X_t) \,\mathrm{d} t + B \,\mathrm{d} W_t$ in $\mathbf{R}^d$, where $A$ encodes the harmonic part of the force and $-F$ corresponds to the gradient of the anharmonic part of the potential, the hypotheses under which we obtain exponential mixing are the following: $A$ is dissipative, the pair $(A,B)$ satisfies the Kalman condition, $F$ grows sufficiently slowly at infinity (depending on the dimension $d$), and the vector fields in the equation of motion satisfy the weak H\"ormander condition in at least one point of the phase space.;math-ph
1801.05377;Ranks and Symmetric Ranks of Cubic Surfaces;We study cubic surfaces as symmetric tensors of format $4 \times 4 \times 4$. We consider the non-symmetric tensor rank and the symmetric Waring rank of cubic surfaces, and show that the two notions coincide over the complex numbers. The corresponding algebraic problem concerns border ranks. We show that the non-symmetric border rank coincides with the symmetric border rank for cubic surfaces. As part of our analysis, we obtain minimal ideal generators for the symmetric analogue to the secant variety from the salmon conjecture. We also give a test for symmetric rank given by the non-vanishing of certain discriminants. The results extend to order three tensors of all sizes, implying the equality of rank and symmetric rank when the symmetric rank is at most seven, and the equality of border rank and symmetric border rank when the symmetric border rank is at most five. We also study real ranks via the real substitution method.;math.AG
1801.05380;On Hecke eigenvalues of Siegel modular forms in the Maass space;In this article, we prove an omega-result for the Hecke eigenvalues $\lambda_F(n)$ of Maass forms $F$ which are Hecke eigenforms in the space of Siegel modular forms of weight $k$, genus two for the Siegel modular group $Sp_2(\Z)$. In particular, we prove $$ \lambda_F(n)= \Omega(n^{k-1}\text{exp} (c \frac{\sqrt{\log n}}{\log\log n})), $$ when $c&gt,0$ is an absolute constant. This improves the earlier result $$ \lambda_F(n)= \Omega(n^{k-1} (\frac{\sqrt{\log n}}{\log\log n})) $$ of Das and the third author. We also show that for any $n \ge 3$, one has $$ \lambda_F(n) \leq n^{k-1}\text{exp} \left(c_1\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}}\right), $$ where $c_1&gt,0$ is an absolute constant. This improves an earlier result of Pitale and Schmidt. Further, we investigate the limit points of the sequence $\{\frac{\lambda_F(n)}{n^{k-1}}\}_{n \in \N}$ and show that it has infinitely many limit points. Finally, we show that $\lambda_F(n) &gt,0$ for all $n$, a result earlier proved by Breulmann by a different technique.;math.NT
1801.05381;Rooted tree maps and the Kawashima relations for multiple zeta values;Recently, inspired by the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of rooted trees, the second named author introduced rooted tree maps as a family of linear maps on the noncommutative polynomial algebra in two letters. These give a class of relations among multiple zeta values, which are known to be a subclass of the so-called linear part of the Kawashima relations. In this paper we show the opposite implication, that is the linear part of the Kawashima relations is implied by the relations coming from rooted tree maps.;math.NT
1801.05393;Coexistence of 5G mmWave Users with Incumbent Fixed Stations over 70 and 80 GHz;Millimeter wave spectrum access over the 70GHz and 80GHz is central to unlocking gigabit connectivity and meeting the explosive growth of mobile traffic. A pressing question, however, is whether fifth-generation (5G) systems can harmoniously coexist with the incumbents of these bands, which are primarily point-to-point fixed stations (FSs). To this end, we thoroughly analyze the impact of 5G coexistence on FSs. Specifically, we first analyze the geometry of existing FSs' deployment using actual databases of these stations. Then, we present a case study on the interference generated from users towards FSs in two populated areas in Chicago, where we use actual building databases to accurately compute the aggregate interference. The analysis and simulation results reveal that the deployment strategy of FSs and the high attenuation losses at 70/80GHz significantly limit the 5G interference, with the majority of FSs experiencing interference levels well below the noise floor.;cs.IT

1801.05398;On the Direction of Discrimination: An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Disparate Impact in Machine Learning;In the context of machine learning, disparate impact refers to a form of systematic discrimination whereby the output distribution of a model depends on the value of a sensitive attribute (e.g., race or gender). In this paper, we propose an information-theoretic framework to analyze the disparate impact of a binary classification model. We view the model as a fixed channel, and quantify disparate impact as the divergence in output distributions over two groups. Our aim is to find a correction function that can perturb the input distributions of each group to align their output distributions. We present an optimization problem that can be solved to obtain a correction function that will make the output distributions statistically indistinguishable. We derive closed-form expressions to efficiently compute the correction function, and demonstrate the benefits of our framework on a recidivism prediction problem based on the ProPublica COMPAS dataset.;cs.IT
1801.05402;Ambulance Emergency Response Optimization in Developing Countries;The lack of emergency medical transportation is viewed as the main barrier to the access of emergency medical care in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). In this paper, we present a robust optimization approach to optimize both the location and routing of emergency response vehicles, accounting for uncertainty in travel times and spatial demand characteristic of LMICs. We traveled to Dhaka, Bangladesh, the sixth largest and third most densely populated city in the world, to conduct field research resulting in the collection of two unique datasets that inform our approach. This data is leveraged to develop machine learning methodologies to estimate demand for emergency medical services in a LMIC setting and to predict the travel time between any two locations in the road network for different times of day and days of the week. We combine our robust optimization and machine learning frameworks with real data to provide an in-depth investigation into three policy-related questions. First, we demonstrate that outpost locations optimized for weekday rush hour lead to good performance for all times of day and days of the week. Second, we find that significant improvements in emergency response times can be achieved by re-locating a small number of outposts and that the performance of the current system could be replicated using only 30% of the resources. Lastly, we show that a fleet of small motorcycle-based ambulances has the potential to significantly outperform traditional ambulance vans. In particular, they are able to capture three times more demand while reducing the median response time by 42% due to increased routing flexibility offered by nimble vehicles on a larger road network.

1801.05405;Uplink Interference Mitigation Techniques for Coexistence of 5G mmWave Users with Incumbents at 70 and 80 GHz;The millimeter wave spectra at 71-76GHz (70GHz) and 81-86GHz (80GHz) have the potential to endow fifth-generation new radio (5G-NR) with mobile connectivity at gigabit rates. However, a pressing issue is the presence of incumbent systems in these bands, which are primarily point-to-point fixed stations (FSs). In this paper, we first identify the key properties of incumbents by parsing databases of existing stations in major cities to devise several modeling guidelines and characterize their deployment geometry and antenna specifications. Second, we develop a detailed uplink interference framework to compute the aggregate interference from outdoor 5G-NR users into FSs. We then present several case studies in dense populated areas, using actual incumbent databases and building layouts. Our simulation results demonstrate promising 5G coexistence at 70GHz and 80GHz as the majority of FSs experience interference well below the noise floor thanks to the propagation losses in these bands and the deployment geometry of the incumbent and 5G systems. For the few FSs that may incur higher interference, we propose several passive interference mitigation techniques such as angular-based exclusion zones and spatial power control. Simulation results show that the techniques can effectively protect FSs, without tangible degradation of the 5G coverage.;eess.SP
1801.05406;Bijective PC-maps of the unipotent radical of the Borel subgroup of the classical symplectic group;Every commutator preserving bijection of the unipotent radical $Up(2n, R)$ of the Borel subgroup of the classical symplectic group of rank at least 4 over a field $F$ such that $6F=F$ is shown to be the composition of a standard automorphism of $Up(2n,R)$ and a central map. The latter is a bijection which acts as the right multiplication by a matrix from the center of $Up(2n,F)$.;math.GR
1801.05411;Expectation Propagation for Approximate Inference: Free Probability Framework;We study asymptotic properties of expectation propagation (EP) -- a method for approximate inference originally developed in the field of machine learning. Applied to generalized linear models, EP iteratively computes a multivariate Gaussian approximation to the exact posterior distribution. The computational complexity of the repeated update of covariance matrices severely limits the application of EP to large problem sizes. In this study, we present a rigorous analysis by means of free probability theory that allows us to overcome this computational bottleneck if specific data matrices in the problem fulfill certain properties of asymptotic freeness. We demonstrate the relevance of our approach on the gene selection problem of a microarray dataset.;cs.IT
1801.05413;Combinatorial Preconditioners for Proximal Algorithms on Graphs;We present a novel preconditioning technique for proximal optimization methods that relies on graph algorithms to construct effective preconditioners. Such combinatorial preconditioners arise from partitioning the graph into forests. We prove that certain decompositions lead to a theoretically optimal condition number. We also show how ideal decompositions can be realized using matroid partitioning and propose efficient greedy variants thereof for large-scale problems. Coupled with specialized solvers for the resulting scaled proximal subproblems, the preconditioned algorithm achieves competitive performance in machine learning and vision applications.;math.OC

1801.05415;Cross-sections of unknotted ribbon disks and algebraic curves;We resolve parts (A) and (B) of Problem 1.100 from Kirby's list by showing that many nontrivial links arise as cross-sections of unknotted holomorphic disks in the four-ball. The techniques can be used to produce unknotted ribbon surfaces with prescribed cross-sections, including unknotted Lagrangian disks with nontrivial cross-sections.;math.GT
1801.05423;A random walk through experimental mathematics;We describe our adventures in creating a new first-year course in Experimental Mathematics that uses active learning. We used a state-of-the-art facility, called The Western Active Learning Space, and got the students to "drive the spaceship" (at least a little bit). This paper describes some of our techniques for pedagogy, some of the vignettes of experimental mathematics that we used, and some of the outcomes. EYSC was a student in the simultaneously-taught senior sister course "Open Problems in Experimental Mathematics" the first time it was taught and an unofficial co-instructor the second time. Jon Borwein attended the Project Presentation Day (the second time) and gave thoughtful feedback to each student. This paper is dedicated to his memory.;math.HO
1801.05451;On Characters and Pure States of *-Algebras;It is easy to see that every character (i.e. unital *-homomorphism to the complex numbers) of a commutative unital associative *-algebra is a pure state (i.e. extreme point in the convex set of all normalized positive linear functionals). This article gives sufficient conditions for the converse to be true as well. In order to formulate these results together with similar ones, e.g. for locally convex *-algebras, the notion of an abstract O*-algebra (unital associative *-algebra with an order defined by positive linear functionals) is introduced. Many concepts and intermediary results discussed here also apply to the non-commutative case.;math.FA
1801.05465;On a bimodal Birnbaum-Saunders distribution with applications to lifetime data;The Birnbaum-Saunders distribution is a flexible and useful model which has been used in several fields. In this paper, a new bimodal version of this distribution based on the alpha-skew-normal distribution is established. We discuss some of its mathematical and inferential properties. We consider likelihood-based methods to estimate the model parameters. We carry out a Monte Carlo simulation study to evaluate the performance of the maximum likelihood estimators. For illustrative purposes, three real data sets are analyzed. The results indicated that the proposed model outperformed some existing models in the literature, in special, a recent bimodal extension of the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution.;math.ST
1801.05466;Testing Separability of Functional Time Series;We derive and study a significance test for determining if a panel of functional time series is separable. In the context of this paper, separability means that the covariance structure factors into the product of two functions, one depending only on time and the other depending only on the coordinates of the panel. Separability is a property which can dramatically improve computational efficiency by substantially reducing model complexity. It is especially useful for functional data as it implies that the functional principal components are the same for each member of the panel. However such an assumption must be verified before proceeding with further inference. Our approach is based on functional norm differences and provides a test with well controlled size and high power. We establish our procedure quite generally, allowing one to test separability of autocovariances as well. In addition to an asymptotic justification, our methodology is validated by a simulation study. It is applied to functional panels of particulate pollution and stock market data.;math.ST
1801.05471;Minimum saturated families of sets;We call a family $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of $[n]$ $s$-saturated if it contains no $s$ pairwise disjoint sets, and moreover no set can be added to $\mathcal{F}$ while preserving this property (here $[n] = \{1,\ldots,n\}$). <br />More than 40 years ago, Erd\H{o}s and Kleitman conjectured that an $s$-saturated family of subsets of $[n]$ has size at least $(1 - 2^{-(s-1)})2^n$. It is easy to show that every $s$-saturated family has size at least $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 2^n$, but, as was mentioned by Frankl and Tokushige, even obtaining a slightly better bound of $(1/2 + \varepsilon)2^n$, for some fixed $\varepsilon &gt, 0$, seems difficult. In this note, we prove such a result, showing that every $s$-saturated family of subsets of $[n]$ has size at least $(1 - 1/s)2^n$. <br />This lower bound is a consequence of a multipartite version of the problem, in which we seek a lower bound on $|\mathcal{F}_1| + \ldots + |\mathcal{F}_s|$ where $\mathcal{F}_1, \ldots, \mathcal{F}_s$ are families of subsets of $[n]$, such that there are no $s$ pairwise disjoint sets, one from each family $\mathcal{F}_i$, and furthermore no set can be added to any of the families while preserving this property. We show that $|\mathcal{F}_1| + \ldots + |\mathcal{F}_s| \ge (s-1)\cdot 2^n$, which is tight e.g.\ by taking $\mathcal{F}_1$ to be empty, and letting the remaining families be the families of all subsets of $[n]$.;math.CO
1801.05474;Upper and lower estimates for numerical integration errors on spheres of arbitrary dimension;In this paper we study the worst-case error of numerical integration on the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{d}\subset\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$, $d\geq2$, for certain spaces of continuous functions on $\mathbb{S}^{d}$. For the classical Sobolev spaces $\mathbb{H}^s(\mathbb{S}^d)$ ($s&gt,\frac d2$) upper and lower bounds for the worst case integration error have been obtained By Brauchart, Hesse, and Sloan earlier in papers. We investigate the behaviour for $s\to\frac d2$ by introducing spaces $\mathbb{H}^{\frac d2,\gamma}(\mathbb{S}^d)$ with an extra logarithmic weight. For these spaces we obtain similar upper and lower bounds for the worst case integration error.;math.CA
1801.05481;Knudsen gas in flat tire;We consider random reflections (according to the Lambertian distribution) of a light ray in a thin variable width (but almost circular) tube. As the width of the tube goes to zero, properly rescaled angular component of the light ray position converges in distribution to a diffusion whose parameters (diffusivity and drift) are given explicitly in terms of the tube width.;math.PR
1801.05483;Pilot Contamination Mitigation with Reduced RF Chains;Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication is a promising technology for increasing spectral efficiency in wireless networks. Two of the main challenges massive MIMO systems face are degraded channel estimation accuracy due to pilot contamination and increase in computational load and hardware complexity due to the massive amount of antennas. In this paper, we focus on the problem of channel estimation in massive MIMO systems, while addressing these two challenges: We jointly design the pilot sequences to mitigate the effect of pilot contamination and propose an analog combiner which maps the high number of sensors to a low number of RF chains, thus reducing the computational and hardware cost. We consider a statistical model in which the channel covariance obeys a Kronecker structure. In particular, we treat two such cases, corresponding to fully- and partially-separable correlations. We prove that with these models, the analog combiner design can be done independently of the pilot sequences. Given the resulting combiner, we derive a closed-form expression for the optimal pilot sequences in the fully-separable case and suggest a greedy sum of ratio traces maximization (GSRTM) method for designing sub-optimal pilots in the partially-separable scenario. We demonstrate via simulations that our pilot design framework achieves lower mean squared error than the common pilot allocation framework previously considered for pilot contamination mitigation.;cs.IT
1801.05484;Puncture repair on metric measure spaces;Motivated by recent interest concerning "puncture repair" in the conformal geometry of compact Riemannian manifolds, a brief exposition on generalisation to the setting of quasiconformal mappings on certain metric measure spaces is presented as well as a brief outline on removability of porous sets.;math.CV
1801.05485;On Rham cohomology of locally trivial Lie groupoids over triangulated manifolds;Based in the isomorphism between Lie algebroid cohomology and piecewise smooth cohomology, it is proved that the Rham cohomology of a locally trivial Lie groupoid $G$ on a smooth manifold $M$ is isomorphic to the piecewise Rham cohomology of $G$, in which $G$ and $M$ are manifolds without boundary and $M$ is smoothly triangulated by a finite simplicial complex $K$ such that, for each simplex $\Delta$ of $K$, the inverse images of $\Delta$ by the source and target mappings of $G$ are transverses submanifolds in the ambient space $G$. As a consequence, it is shown that the piecewise de Rham cohomology of $G$ does not depend on the triangulation of the base.;math.GT
1801.05488;Mayer-Vietoris sequence in cohomology of Lie algebroids on simplicial complexes;It is shown that the Mayer-Vietoris sequence holds for the cohomology of complexes of Lie algebroids which are defined on simplicial complexes and satisfy the compatibility condition concerning restrictions to the faces of each simplex. The Mayer-Vietoris sequence will be obtained as a consequence of the extension lemma for piecewise smooth forms defined on complexes of Lie algebroids.;math.AT
1801.05493;Gorenstein projective objects in functor categories;Let $k$ be a commutative ring, let $\mathcal{C}$ be a small, $k$-linear, Hom-finite, locally bounded category, and let $\mathcal{B}$ be a $k$-linear abelian category. We construct a Frobenius exact subcategory $\mathcal{GP}(\mathcal{G}_P\operatorname{proj}(\mathcal{B}^{\mathcal{C}}))$ of the functor category $\mathcal{B}^{\mathcal{C}}$, and we show that it is a subcategory of the Gorenstein projective objects $\mathcal{GP}(\mathcal{B}^{\mathcal{C}})$ in $\mathcal{B}^{\mathcal{C}}$. Furthermore, we obtain criteria for when $\mathcal{GP}(\mathcal{G}_P\operatorname{proj}(\mathcal{B}^{\mathcal{C}}))=\mathcal{GP}(\mathcal{B}^{\mathcal{C}})$. We show in examples that this can be used to compute $\mathcal{GP}(\mathcal{B}^{\mathcal{C}})$ explicitly.;math.CT
1801.05494;A group commutator involving the last distance matrix and dual distance matrix of a $Q$-polynomial distance-regular graph;Let $\Gamma$ denote the Hamming graph $H(D,r)$ with $r \geq 3$. Consider the distance matrices $\{A_i\}_{i=0}^{D}$ of $\Gamma$. Fix a vertex $x$ of $\Gamma$, and consider the dual distance matrices $\{A_i^{*}\}_{i=0}^{D}$ of $\Gamma$ with respect to $x$. We investigate the group commutator $A_{D}^{-1}A_{D}^{*-1}A_{D}A_{D}^{*}$. We show that this matrix is diagonalizable. We compute its eigenvalues and their eigenspaces. Let $T$ denote the subconstituent algebra of $\Gamma$ with respect to $x$. We describe the action of $A_{D}^{-1}A_{D}^{*-1}A_{D}A_{D}^{*}$ on each irreducible $T$-module.;math.CO
1801.05496;Algorithmic aspects of $M$-Lipschitz mappings of graphs;$M$-Lipschitz mappings of graphs (or equivalently graph-indexed random walks) are a generalization of standard random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$. For $M \in \N$, an \emph{$M$-Lipschitz mapping} of a connected rooted graph $G = (V,E)$ is a mapping $f: V \to \Z$ such that root is mapped to zero and for every edge $(u,v) \in E$ we have $|f(u) - f(v)| \le M$. <br />We study two natural problems regarding graph-indexed random walks. - Computing the maximum range of a graph-indexed random walk for a given graph. - Deciding if we can extend a partial GI random walk into a full GI random walk for a given graph. <br />We show that both these problems are polynomial-time solvable and we show efficient algorithms for them. To our best knowledge, this is the first algorithmic treatment of Lipschitz mappings of graphs. Furthermore, our problem of extending partial mappings is connected to the problem of \emph{list homomorphism} and yields a better run-time complexity for a specific family of its instances.;math.CO
1801.05498;Graph-indexed random walks on special classes of graphs;We investigate the paramater of the average range of $M$-Lipschitz mapping of a given graph. We focus on well-known classes such as paths, complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs and cycles and show closed formulas for computing this parameter and also we conclude asymptotics of this parameter on these aforementioned classes.;math.CO
1801.05499;Exponential decay estimates for fundamental solutions of Schr&#xf6,dinger-type operators;In the present paper we establish sharp exponential decay estimates for operator and integral kernels of the (not necessarily self-adjoint) operators $L=-(\nabla-i\mathbf{a})^TA(\nabla-i\mathbf{a})+V$. The latter class includes, in particular, the magnetic Schr\"odinger operator $-\left(\nabla-i\mathbf{a}\right)^2+V$ and the generalized electric Schr\"odinger operator $-{\rm div }A\nabla+V$. Our exponential decay bounds rest on a generalization of the Fefferman-Phong uncertainty principle to the present context and are governed by the Agmon distance associated to the corresponding maximal function. In the presence of a scale-invariant Harnack inequality, for instance, for the generalized electric Schr\"odinger operator with real coefficients, we establish both lower and upper estimates for fundamental solutions, thus demonstrating sharpness of our results. The only previously known estimates of this type pertain to the classical Schr\"odinger operator $-\Delta +V$.;math.AP
1801.05500;Cellular-Connected UAVs over 5G: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Interference Management;In this paper, an interference-aware path planning scheme for a network of cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is proposed. In particular, each UAV aims at achieving a tradeoff between maximizing energy efficiency and minimizing both wireless latency and the interference level caused on the ground network along its path. The problem is cast as a dynamic game among UAVs. To solve this game, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, based on echo state network (ESN) cells, is proposed. The introduced deep ESN architecture is trained to allow each UAV to map each observation of the network state to an action, with the goal of minimizing a sequence of time-dependent utility functions. Each UAV uses ESN to learn its optimal path, transmission power level, and cell association vector at different locations along its path. The proposed algorithm is shown to reach a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) upon convergence. Moreover, an upper and lower bound for the altitude of the UAVs is derived thus reducing the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves better wireless latency per UAV and rate per ground user (UE) while requiring a number of steps that is comparable to a heuristic baseline that considers moving via the shortest distance towards the corresponding destinations. The results also show that the optimal altitude of the UAVs varies based on the ground network density and the UE data rate requirements and plays a vital role in minimizing the interference level on the ground UEs as well as the wireless transmission delay of the UAV.;cs.IT
1801.05501;An operator that relates to semi-meander polynomials via a two-sided q-Wick formula;We consider the sequence $( Q_n )_{n=1}^{\infty}$ of semi-meander polynomials which are used in the enumeration of semi-meandric systems (a family of diagrams related to the classical stamp-folding problem). We show that for a fixed natural number $d$, the sequence $( Q_n (d) )_{n=1}^{\infty}$ appears as sequence of moments for a compactly supported probability measure $\nu_d$ on the real line. More generally, we consider a two-variable generalization $Q_n (t,u)$ of $Q_n(t)$, which is related to a natural concept of "self-intersecting meandric system", the second variable of $Q_n (t,u)$ keeps track of the crossings of such a system (and one has, in particular, that $Q_n (t,0)$ is the original semi-meander polynomial $Q_n (t)$). We prove that for a fixed natural number $d$ and a fixed real number $q$ with $|q| &lt, 1$, the sequence $( Q_n (d,q) )_{n=1}^{\infty}$ appears as sequence of moments for a compactly supported probability measure $\nu_{d:q}$ on the real line. The measure $\nu_{d,q}$ is found as scalar spectral measure for an operator $T_{d,q}$ constructed by using left and right creation/annihilation operators on a $q$-deformation of the full Fock space introduced by Bozejko and Speicher. The relevant calculations of moments for $T_{d,q}$ are made by using a two-sided version of a (previously studied in the one-sided case) $q$-Wick formula, which involves the number of crossings of a pair-partition.;math.OA
1801.05505;Time functions and $K$-causality between measures;Employing the notion of a coupling between measures, drawn from the optimal transport theory, we study the extension of the Sorkin-Woolgar causal relation $K^+$ onto the space $\mathscr{P}(\mathcal{M})$ of Borel probability measures on a given spacetime $\mathcal{M}$. We show that Minguzzi's characterization of $K^+$ in terms of time functions possesses a "measure-theoretic" generalization. Moreover, we prove that the relation $K^+$ extended onto $\mathscr{P}(\mathcal{M})$ retains its property of antisymmetry for $\mathcal{M}$ stably causal.;math-ph
1801.05506;Local m-adic constancy of F-pure thresholds and test ideals;In this note, we consider a corollary of the ACC conjecture for F-pure thresholds. Specifically, we show that the F-pure threshold (and more generally, the test ideals) associated to a polynomial with an isolated singularity are locally constant in the m-adic topology of the corresponding local ring. As a by-product of our methods, we also describe a simple algorithm for computing all of the F-jumping numbers and test ideals associated to an arbitrary polynomial over an F-finite field.;math.AC

We construct the isomorphism of Clifford algebra modules of sequences of transfer matrices and the boson space of symmetric functions. As an application, tau-functions of transfer matrices immediately arise from classical tau-functions of symmetric functions.;math-ph
1801.05518;A note on strong convergence of implicit scheme for SDEs under local one-sided Lipschitz conditions;Under a local one-sided Lipschitz condition, Krylov [KR] proved the existence and uniqueness of the strong solutions for stochastic differential equations by using the Euler-Maruyama approximation, where he showed that the sequence of numerical solutions converges to the true solution in probability as the stepsize tends to zero. In this note, we shall extend the results in [KR] and investigate an implicit numerical scheme for these equations under a local one-sided Lipschitz condition.;math.NA
1801.05521;Event-triggered Control of Infinite-dimensional Systems;This paper addresses the problem of event-triggered control for infinite-dimensional systems. We employ event-triggering mechanisms that compare the plant state and the error of the control input induced by the event-triggered implementation. Under the assumption that feedback operators are compact, a strictly positive lower bound on the inter-event times can be guaranteed. We show that if the threshold of the event-triggering mechanisms is sufficiently small, then the event-triggered control system with a bounded control operator and a compact feedback operator is exponentially stable. For infinite-dimensional systems with unbounded control operators, we employ two event-triggering mechanisms that are based on system decomposition and periodic event-triggering, respectively, and then analyze the exponential stability of the closed-loop system under each event-triggering mechanism.;math.OC
1801.05523;On the multiple membranes problem;We establish the optimal regularity for solutions to the multiple membranes problem, and perform a blow-up analysis at points on the free boundary with the highest multiplicity. This leads to a complete classification of blow-up profiles in the plane. The main technical tool is a Weiss-type monotonicity formula.;math.AP
1801.05524;Counting Borel Orbits in Symmetric Varieties of Types $BI$ and $CII$;This is a continuation of our combinatorial program on the enumeration of Borel orbits in symmetric varieties of classical types. Here, we determine the generating series the numbers of Borel orbits in $\mathbf{SO}_{2n+1}/\mathbf{S(O}_{2p}\times \mathbf{O}_{2q+1}\mathbf{)}$ (type $BI$) and in $\mathbf{Sp}_n/\mathbf{Sp}_p\times \mathbf{Sp}_q$ (type $CII$). In addition, we explore relations to lattice path enumeration.;math.CO
1801.05527;Cahn--Hilliard inpainting with the double obstacle potential;The inpainting of damaged images has a wide range of applications, and many different mathematical methods have been proposed to solve this problem. Inpainting with the help of Cahn--Hilliard models has been particularly successful, and it turns out that Cahn--Hilliard inpainting with the double obstacle potential can lead to better results compared to inpainting with a smooth double well potential. However, a mathematical analysis of this approach is missing so far. In this paper we give first analytical results for a Cahn--Hilliard double obstacle inpainting model regarding existence of global solutions to the time-dependent problem and stationary solutions to the time-independent problem without constraints on the parameters involved. With the help of numerical results we show the effectiveness of the approach for binary and grayscale images.;math.AP
1801.05530;Notes on Ricci solitons in $f$-cosymplectic manifolds;The purpose of this article is to study an $f$-cosymplectic manifold $M$ admitting Ricci solitons. Here we consider mainly two classes of Ricci solitons on $f$-cosymplectic manifolds. One is the class of contact Ricci solitons. The other is the class of gradient Ricci solitons, for which we give the local classifications of $M$. Meanwhile, we also give some properties of $f$-cosymplectic manifolds.;math.DG
1801.05533;Einstein-Weyl structures on almost cosymplectic manifolds;In this article, we study Einstein-Weyl structures on almost cosymplectic manifolds. First we prove that an almost cosymplectic $(\kappa,\mu)$-manifold is Einstein or cosymplectic if it admits a closed Einstein-Weyl structure or two Einstein-Weyl structures. Next for a three dimensional compact almost $\alpha$-cosymplectic manifold admitting closed Einstein-Weyl structures, we prove that it is Ricc-flat. Further, we show that an almost $\alpha$-cosymplectic admitting two Einstein-Weyl structures is either Einstein or $\alpha$-cosymplectic, provided that its Ricci tensor is commuting. Finally, we prove that a compact $K$-cosymplectic manifold with a closed Einstein-Weyl structure or two special Einstein-Weyl structures is cosymplectic.;math.DG

1801.05538;Stable Phaseless Sampling and Reconstruction of Real-Valued Signals with Finite Rate of Innovations;A spatial signal is defined by its evaluations on the whole domain. In this paper, we consider stable reconstruction of real-valued signals with finite rate of innovations (FRI), up to a sign, from their magnitude measurements on the whole domain or their phaseless samples on a discrete subset. FRI signals appear in many engineering applications such as magnetic resonance spectrum, ultra wide-band communication and electrocardiogram. For an FRI signal, we introduce an undirected graph to describe its topological structure. We establish the equivalence between the graph connectivity and phase retrievability of FRI signals, and we apply the graph connected component decomposition to find all FRI signals that have the same magnitude measurements as the original FRI signal has. We construct discrete sets with finite density explicitly so that magnitude measurements of FRI signals on the whole domain are determined by their samples taken on those discrete subsets. In this paper, we also propose a stable algorithm with linear complexity to reconstruct FRI signals from their phaseless samples on the above phaseless sampling set. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated theoretically and numerically to provide a suboptimal approximation to the original FRI signal in magnitude measurements.;cs.IT
1801.05540;$G_2$-metrics arising from non-integrable special Lagrangian fibrations;We study special Lagrangian fibrations of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$-manifolds, not necessarily torsion-free. In the case where the fiber is a unimodular Lie group $G$, we decompose such $\mathrm{SU}(3)$-structures into triples of solder 1-forms, connection 1-forms and equivariant $3\times3$ positive-definite symmetric matrix-valued functions on principal $G$-bundles over 3-manifolds. As applications, we describe regular parts of $G_2$-manifolds that admit Lagrangian-type 3-dimensional group actions by constrained dynamical systems on the spaces of the triples in the cases of $G=\mathrm{T}^3$ and $\mathrm{SO}(3)$.;math.DG
1801.05543;On a Class of Diffusion-Aggregation Equations;We investigate the diffusion-aggregation equations with degenerate diffusion $\Delta u^m$ and singular interaction kernel $\mathcal{K}_s = (-\Delta)^{-s}$ with $s\in(0,\frac{d}{2})$. We analyze the regime %($m&gt,2-2s/d$, $d$ is the dimension) where the diffusive forces are stronger than the aggregation forces. In such regime, we show existence, uniform boundedness and H\"{o}lder regularity of solutions in the case that either $s&gt,\frac{1}{2}$ or $m&lt,2$. Uniqueness is proved for kernels with $s&gt,1$.;math.AP
1801.05550;The Hardy-Littlewood Maximal Operator on Discrete Morrey Spaces;We discuss the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator on discrete Morrey spaces of arbitrary dimension. In particular, we obtain its boundedness on the discrete Morrey spaces using a discrete version of the Fefferman-Stein inequality. As a corollary, we also obtain the boundedness of some Riesz potentials on discrete Morrey spaces.;math.FA
1801.05553;Wiener-Hopf factorization for time-inhomogeneous Markov chains and its application;In this paper we derive the Wiener-Hopf factorization for a finite-state time-inhomogeneous Markov chain. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to investigate the Wiener-Hopf factorization for time-inhomogeneous Markov chains. In this work we only deal with a special class of time-inhomogeneous Markovian generators, namely piece-wise constant, which allows to use an appropriately tailored randomization technique. Besides the mathematical importance of the Wiener-Hopf factorization methodology, there is also an important computational aspect: it allows for efficient computation of important functionals of Markov chains.;math.PR
1801.05555;Some algebraic and arithmetic properties of Feynman diagrams;This article reports on some recent progresses in Bessel moments, which represent a class of Feynman diagrams in 2-dimensional quantum field theory. Many challenging mathematical problems on these Bessel moments have been formulated as a vast set of conjectures, by David Broadhurst and collaborators, who work at the intersection of high energy physics, number theory and algebraic geometry. We present the main ideas behind our verifications of several such conjectures, which revolve around linear and non-linear sum rules of Bessel moments, as well as relations between individual Feynman diagrams and critical values of modular $L$-functions.;math.NT
1801.05556;Linear recurrence sequences and the duality defect conjecture;It is conjectured that the dual variety of every smooth nonlinear subvariety of dimension $&gt, \frac{2N}{3}$ in projective $N$-space is a hypersurface, an expectation known as the duality defect conjecture. This would follow from the truth of Hartshorne's complete intersection conjecture but nevertheless remains open for the case of subvarieties of codimension $&gt, 2$. A combinatorial approach to proving the conjecture in the codimension $2$ case was developed by Holme, and following this approach Oaland devised an algorithm for proving the conjecture in the codimension $3$ case for particular $N$. This combinatorial approach gives a potential method of proving the duality defect conjecture in many of the cases by studying the positivity of certain homogeneous integer linear recurrence sequences. We give a generalization of the algorithm of Oaland to the higher codimension cases, obtaining with this bounds the degrees of counterexamples would have to satisfy, and using the relationship with recurrence sequences we prove that the conjecture holds in the codimension $3$ case when $N$ is odd.;math.AG
1801.05562;An Explicit CM Type Norm Formula and Effective Nonvanishing of Class Group L-functions for CM Fields;We show that the central value of class group L-functions of CM fields can be expressed in terms of derivatives of real-analytic Hilbert Eisenstein series at CM points. Then, following an idea of Iwaniec and Kowalski we obtain a conditional explicit lower bound of class numbers of CM fields under a weaker assumption. Some results in the proof lead to an effective nonvanishing result for class group L-functions of general CM fields, generalizing the only known ineffective results.;math.NT
1801.05563;Unique Continuation for Sublinear Elliptic Equations Based on Carleman Estimates;In this article we deal with different forms of the unique continuation property for second order elliptic equations with nonlinear potentials of sublinear growth. Under suitable regularity assumptions, we prove the weak and the strong unique continuation property. Moreover, we also discuss the unique continuation property from measurable sets, which shows that nodal domains to these equations must have vanishing Lebesgue measure. Our methods rely on suitable Carleman estimates, for which we include the sublinear potential into the main part of the operator.;math.AP
1801.05565;Robust Modifications of U-statistics and Applications to Covariance Estimation Problems;Let $Y$ be a $d$-dimensional random vector with unknown mean $\mu$ and covariance matrix $\Sigma$. This paper is motivated by the problem of designing an estimator of $\Sigma$ that admits tight deviation bounds in the operator norm under minimal assumptions on the underlying distribution, such as existence of only 4th moments of the coordinates of $Y$. To address this problem, we propose robust modifications of the operator-valued U-statistics, obtain non-asymptotic guarantees for their performance, and demonstrate the implications of these results to the covariance estimation problem under various structural assumptions.;math.ST
1801.05567;Exploiting Diversity in Molecular Timing Channels via Order Statistics;We study diversity in one-shot communication over molecular timing channels. We consider a channel model where the transmitter simultaneously releases a large number of information particles, while the information is encoded in the time of release. The receiver decodes the information based on the random time of arrival of the information particles. The random propagation is characterized by the general class of right-sided unimodal densities. We characterize the asymptotic exponential decrease rate of the probability of error as a function of the number of released particles, and denote this quantity as the system diversity gain. Four types of detectors are considered: the maximum-likelihood (ML) detector, a linear detector, a detector that is based on the first arrival (FA) among all the transmitted particles, and a detector based on the last arrival (LA). When the density characterizing the random propagation is supported over a large interval, we show that the simple FA detector achieves a diversity gain very close to that of the ML detector. On the other hand, when the density characterizing the random propagation is supported over a small interval, we show that the simple LA detector achieves a diversity gain very close to that of the ML detector.;cs.IT
1801.05569;Hybrid functions approach to solve a class of Fredholm and Volterra integro-differential equations;In this paper, we use a numerical method that involves hybrid and block-pulse functions to approximate solutions of systems of a class of Fredholm and Volterra integro-differential equations. The key point is to derive a new approximation for the derivatives of the solutions and then reduce the integro-differential equation to a system of algebraic equations that can be solved using classical methods. Some numerical examples are dedicated for showing efficiency and validity of the method that we introduce.;math.NA
1801.05575;Structure of eigenvectors of random regular digraphs;Let $d$ and $n$ be integers satisfying $C\leq d\leq \exp(c\sqrt{\ln n})$ for some universal constants $c, C&gt,0$, and let $z\in \mathbb{C}$. Denote by $M$ the adjacency matrix of a random $d$-regular directed graph on $n$ vertices. In this paper, we study the structure of the kernel of submatrices of $M-z\,{\rm Id}$, formed by removing a subset of rows. We show that with large probability the kernel consists of two non-intersecting types of vectors, which we call very steep and gradual with many levels. As a corollary, we show, in particular, that every eigenvector of $M$, except for constant multiples of $(1,1,\dots,1)$, possesses a weak delocalization property: its level sets have cardinality less than $Cn\ln^2 d/\ln n$. For a large constant $d$ this provides a principally new structural information on eigenvectors, implying that the number of their level sets grows to infinity with $n$. As a key technical ingredient of our proofs we introduce a decomposition of $\mathbb{C}^n$ into vectors of different degrees of `structuredness', which is an alternative to the decomposition based on the least common denominator in the regime when the underlying random matrix is very sparse.;math.PR
1801.05576;Circular law for sparse random regular digraphs;Fix a constant $C\geq 1$ and let $d=d(n)$ satisfy $d\leq \ln^{C} n$ for every large integer $n$. Denote by $A_n$ the adjacency matrix of a uniform random directed $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices. We show that, as long as $d\to\infty$ with $n$, the empirical spectral distribution of appropriately rescaled matrix $A_n$ converges weakly in probability to the circular law. This result, together with an earlier work of Cook, completely settles the problem of weak convergence of the empirical distribution in directed $d$-regular setting with the degree tending to infinity. As a crucial element of our proof, we develop a technique of bounding intermediate singular values of $A_n$ based on studying random normals to rowspaces and on constructing a product structure to deal with the lack of independence between the matrix entries.;math.PR
1801.05577;The rank of random regular digraphs of constant degree;Let $d$ be a fixed large integer. For any $n$ larger than $d$, let $A_n$ be the adjacency matrix of the random directed $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, with the uniform distribution. We show that $A_n$ has rank at least $n-1$ with probability going to one as $n$ goes to infinity. The proof combines the method of simple switchings and a recent result of the authors on delocalization of eigenvectors of $A_n$.;math.PR
1801.05579;Special Weierstrass points on algebraic curves in $\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$;In this paper we demonstrate that the notion of inflection points and extactic points on plane algebraic curves can be suitably transferred to curves in $\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$. <br />More precisely, we describe osculating curves and study Weierstrass points of algebraic curves in the surface $\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$ with respect to certain linear systems. In particular, we study points where a fiber of $\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$ is tangent, and points with a hyperosculating $(1,1)$-curve. In the first case we find Hessian-like curves that intersect the curve in these points, and in the second case we find a local criteria. Moreover, we provide Pl\"ucker-like formulas for the number of smooth Weierstrass points on a curve. In the special case of rational curves, we use suitable Wronskians to compute these points and their respective Weierstrass weights.;math.AG
1801.05582;Attractors for two dimensional waves with homogeneous Hamiltonians of degree 0;The density stratification in an incompressible fluid is responsible for the propagation of internal waves. In domains with topography, these waves exhibit interesting features. In particular, numerical and lab experiments show that, in two dimensions, for generic forcing frequencies, these waves concentrate on attractors. The goal of this paper is to analyze mathematically this behavior, using tools from spectral theory and microlocal analysis. The same results apply also to inertial waves in rotating fluids.;math-ph
1801.05584;Locating multiple multipolar acoustic sources using the direct sampling method;This work is concerned with the inverse source problem of locating multiple multipolar sources from boundary measurements for the Helmholtz equation. We develop simple and effective sampling schemes for location acquisition of the sources with a single wavenumber. Our algorithms are based on some novel indicator functions whose indicating behaviors could be used to locate multiple multipolar sources. The inversion schemes are totally "direct" in the sense that only simple integral calculations are involved in evaluating the indicator functions. Rigorous mathematical justifications are provided and extensive numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and efficiency of the proposed methods.;math.AP
1801.05587;Stability estimates for non-local scalar conservation laws;We prove the stability of entropy weak solutions of a class of scalar conservation laws with non-local flux arising in traffic modelling. We obtain an estimate of the dependence of the solution with respect to the kernel function, the speed and the initial datum. Stability is obtained from the entropy condition through doubling of variable technique. We finally provide some numerical simulations illustrating the dependencies above for some cost functionals derived from traffic flow applications.;math.AP
1801.05589;On the Proximal Gradient Algorithm with Alternated Inertia;In this paper, we investigate the attractive properties of the proximal gradient algorithm with inertia. Notably, we show that using alternated inertia yields monotonically decreasing functional values, which contrasts with usual accelerated proximal gradient methods. We also provide convergence rates for the algorithm with alternated inertia based on local geometric properties of the objective function. The results are put into perspective by discussions on several extensions and illustrations on common regularized problems.;math.OC
1801.05591;Combinatorics of patience sorting monoids;This paper makes a combinatorial study of the two monoids and the two types of tableaux that arise from the two possible generalizations of the Patience Sorting algorithm from permutations (or standard words) to words. For both types of tableaux, we present Robinson--Schensted--Knuth-type correspondences (that is, bijective correspondences between word arrays and certain pairs of semistandard tableaux of the same shape), generalizing two known correspondences: a bijective correspondence between standard words and certain pairs of standard tableaux, and an injective correspondence between words and pairs of tableaux. <br />We also exhibit formulas to count both the number of each type of tableaux with given evaluations (that is, containing a given number of each symbol). Observing that for any natural number $n$, the $n$-th Bell number is given by the number of standard tableaux containing $n$ symbols, we restrict the previous formulas to standard words and extract a formula for the Bell numbers. Finally, we present a `hook length formula' that gives the number of standard tableaux of a given shape and deduce some consequences.;math.CO
1801.05592;On Harish-Chandra modules of the Lie algebra arising from the $2$-Dimensional Torus;Let $A=\mathbb{C}[t_1^{\pm1},t_2^{\pm1}]$ be the algebra of Laurent polynomials in two variables and $B$ be the set of skew derivations of $A$. Let $L$ be the universal central extension of the derived Lie subalgebra of the Lie algebra $A\rtimes B$. Set $\widetilde{L}=L\oplus\mathbb{C} d_1\oplus\mathbb{C} d_2$, where $d_1$, $d_2$ are two degree derivations. A Harish-Chandra module is defined as an irreducible weight module with finite dimensional weight spaces. In this paper, we prove that a Harish-Chandra module of the Lie algebra $\widetilde{L}$ is a uniformly bounded module or a generalized highest weight (GHW for short) module. Furthermore, we prove that the nonzero level Harish-Chandra modules of $\widetilde{L}$ are GHW modules. Finally, we classify all the GHW Harish-Chandra modules of $\widetilde{L}$.;math.RT
1801.05593;Relation between combinatorial Ricci curvature and Lin-Lu-Yau&#x27,s Ricci Curvature on cell complexes;In this paper we compare the combinatorial Ricci curvature on cell complexes and the LLY-Ricci curvature defined on graphs. A cell complex is correspondence to a graph such that the vertexes are cells and the edges are vectors on the cell complex. We compare this two Ricci curvature by the cooupling and Kantrovich duality.;math.CO
1801.05608;Catalan numbers, Hankel determinants and Fibonacci polynomials;This (partly expository) paper originated from the study of Hankel determinants of convolution powers of Catalan numbers and of Narayana polynomials. This led to some Hankel determinants of signed Catalan numbers whose values are multiples of Fibonacci numbers and to some Hankel determinants of signed central binomial coefficients whose values are multiples of Lucas numbers. Most proofs are computational but we also include a combinatorial one due to Christian Krattenthaler. Finally we formulate some conjectures.;math.CO
1801.05612;Aubry-Mather and weak KAM theories for contact Hamiltonian systems. Part 1: Strictly increasing case;This paper is concerned with the study of Aubry-Mather and weak KAM theories for contact Hamiltonian systems with Hamiltonians $H(x,u,p)$ defined on $T^*M\times\mathbb{R}$, satisfying Tonelli conditions with respect to $p$ and $0&lt,\frac{\partial H}{\partial u}\leqslant \lambda$ for some $\lambda&gt,0$, where $M$ is a connected, closed and smooth manifold. First, we show the uniqueness of the backward weak KAM solutions of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Using the unique backward weak KAM solution $u_-$, we prove the existence of the maximal forward weak KAM solution $u_+$. Next, we analyse Aubry set for the contact Hamiltonian system showing that it is the intersection of two Legendrian pseudographs $G_{u_-}$ and $G_{u_+}$, and that the projection $\pi:T^*M\times \mathbb{R}\to M$ induces a bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism $\pi|_{\tilde{\mathcal{A}}}$ from Aubry set $\tilde{\mathcal{A}}$ onto the projected Aubry set $\mathcal{A}$. At last, we introduce the notion of barrier functions and study their interesting properties along calibrated curves. Our analysis is based on a recent method by [43,44].;math.DS
1801.05623;Existence and multiplicity of solutions for resonant $(p,2)$-equations;We consider Dirichlet elliptic equations driven by the sum of a $p$-Laplacian $(2&lt,p)$ and a Laplacian. The conditions on the reaction term imply that the problem is resonant at both $\pm\infty$ and at zero. We prove an existence theorem (producing one nontrivial smooth solution) and a multiplicity theorem (producing five nontrivial smooth solutions, four of constant sign and the fifth nodal, the solutions are ordered). Our approach uses variational methods and critical groups.;math.AP
1801.05624;Stability for the mailing problem;We prove that optimal traffic plans for the mailing problem in $\mathbb{R}^d$ are stable with respect to variations of the given coupling, above the critical exponent $\alpha=1-1/d$, thus solving an open problem stated in the book "Optimal transportation networks", by Bernot, Caselles and Morel. We apply our novel result to study some regularity properties of the minimizers of the mailing problem. In particular, we show that only finitely many connected components of an optimal traffic plan meet together at any branching point.;math.AP
1801.05625;Biorthogonality and para-orthogonality of $R_I$ polynomials;In this paper, a sequence of linear combination of $R_{I}$ type polynomials such that the terms in this sequence have a common zero is constructed. A biorthogonality relation arising from such a sequence is discussed. Besides a sequence of para-orthogonal polynomials by removing the common zero using suitable conditions is obtained. Finally, a case of hypergeometric functions is studied to illustrate the results obtained.;math.CA
1801.05626;Non-Embedding Theorems of Nilpotent Lie groups and Sub-Riemannian Manifolds;We prove that there do not exist quasi-isometric embeddings of connected nonabelian nilpotent Lie groups equipped with left invariant Riemannian metrics into a metric measure space satisfying the RCD(0,N), with N &gt, 1. In fact, we can prove that a subRiemannian manifold whose generic degree of nonholonomy is not smaller than 2 can not be biLipschitzly embedded in any Banach space with the Radon-Nikodym property. We also get that every regular sub-Riemannian manifold do not satisfy the CD(K,N) with N &gt, 1. We also prove that the subRiemannian manifold is infinitesimally Hilbert space.;math.DG
1801.05628;Zoology in the H&#xe9,non family: twin babies and Milnor&#x27,s swallows;We study $C^{d,r}$-H\'enon-like families $(f_{a\, b})_{a\, b}$ with two parameters $(a,b)\in \mathbb R^2$. We show the existence of an open set of parameters $(a,b)\in \mathcal D$, so that a renormalization chart conjugates an iterate of $f_{a\, b}$ to a perturbation of $(x,y)\mapsto ((x^2+c_1)^2+c_2,0)$. We prove that the map $(a,b)\in \mathcal D\mapsto (c_1,c_2)$ is a $C^d$-diffeomorphism, as first numerically conjectured by Milnor in 1992. <br />Furthermore, we show the existence of an open set of parameters $(a,b)$ so that $f_{a\, b}$ displays exactly two different renormalized H\'enon-like maps whose basins union attracts Lebesgue a.e. point with bounded forward orbit. A great freedom in the choice of the renormalized parameters enables us to deduce in particular the existence of a (unperturbed) H\'enon map with exactly $2$ attracting cycles (an answer to a Question by Lyubich). <br />The proof is based on a generalization of puzzle pieces for H\'enon-like maps, and on a generalization of both the affine-like formalism of Palis-Yoccoz and the cross map of Shilnikov. The distortion bounds enable us to define (for the first time) $C^{r}$ and $C^{d,r}$-renormalizations and multi-renormalizations with bounds on all the derivatives.;math.DS
1801.05629;Game-Theoretical Strategy of Robot in the Area with Dynamical Obstacles;The effectiveness of a robot manipulation to a large extent is determined by the speed of making this or that movement needed for carrying out the task. Accordingly to this the problem of optimal robot control is often subdivided into two subproblems solved separately. In an autonomous regime the trajectory planning is fulfilled for providing the robot movement time close to the minimal.;math.OC
1801.05630;On Global Existence and Blow-up for Damped Stochastic Nonlinear Schr&#xf6,dinger Equation;In this paper, we consider the well-posedness of the weakly damped stochastic nonlinear Schr\"odinger(NLS) equation driven by multiplicative noise. First, we show the global existence of the unique solution for the damped stochastic NLS equation in critical case. Meanwhile, the exponential integrability of the solution is proved, which implies the continuous dependence on the initial data. Then, we analyze the effect of the damped term and noise on the blow-up phenomenon. By modifying the associated energy, momentum and variance identity, we deduce a sharp blow-up condition for damped stochastic NLS equation in supercritical case. Moreover, we show that when the damped effect is large enough, the damped effect can prevent the blow-up of the solution with high probability.;math.PR
1801.05633;The Baire category of the hyperspace of nontrivial convergent sequences;Assume that $X$ is a regular space. We study topological properties of the family $S_c(X)$ of nontrivial convergent sequences in $X$ equipped with the Vietoris topology. We show that if $X$ has no isolated points, then $S_c(X)$ is a space of the first category which answers the question posed by S. Garcia-Ferreira and Y.F. Ortiz-Castillo.;math.GN
1801.05634;Quantum superintegrable system with a novel chain structure of quadratic algebras;We analyse the $n$-dimensional superintegrable Kepler-Coulomb system with non-central terms. We find a novel underlying chain structure of quadratic algebras formed by the integrals of motion. We identify the elements for each sub-structure and obtain the algebra relations satisfied by them and the corresponding Casimir operators. These quadratic sub-algebras are realized in terms of a chain of deformed oscillators with factorized structure functions. We construct the finite-dimensional unitary representations of the deformed oscillators, and give an algebraic derivation of the energy spectrum of the superintegrable system.;math-ph
1801.05636;Weighted quasi-metrics associated with Finsler metrics;The current paper deals with some new classes of Finsler metrics with reversible geodesics. We construct weighted quasi-metrics associated with these metrics. Further, we investigate some important geometric properties of weighted quasi-metric space. Finally, we discuss the embedding of quasi-metric spaces with generalized weight.;math.DG
1801.05645;Pseudospectral bound and transition threshold for the 3D Kolmogorov flow;In this paper, we establish the pseudospectral bound for the linearized operator of the Navier-Stokes equations around the 3D Kolmogorov flow. Using the pseudospectral bound and the wave operator method introduced in [LWZ], we prove the sharp enhanced dissipation rate for the linearized Navier-Stokes equations. As an application, we prove that if the initial velocity satisfies $\big\| U_0-\big(k_f^{-2}\sin(k_fy),0,0\big)\big\|_{H^2}\le c\nu^{\frac{7}{4}}$ ($\nu$ the viscosity coefficient) and $k_f\in (0,1)$, then the solution does not transition away from the Kolmogorov flow.;math.AP
1801.05648;Parallel Block-Preconditioned Monolithic Solvers for Fluid-Structure-Interaction Problems;In this work, we consider the solution of fluid-structure interaction problems using a monolithic approach for the coupling between fluid and solid subproblems. The coupling of both equations is realized by means of the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian framework and a nonlinear harmonic mesh motion model. Monolithic approaches require the solution of large, ill-conditioned linear systems of algebraic equations at every Newton step. Direct solvers tend to use too much memory even for a relatively small number of degrees of freedom, and, in addition, exhibit superlinear grow in arithmetic complexity. Thus, iterative solvers are the only viable option. To ensure convergence of iterative methods within a reasonable amount of iterations, good and, at the same time, cheap preconditioners have to be developed. We study physics-based block preconditioners, which are derived from the block $LDU$-factorization of the FSI Jacobian, and their performance on distributed memory parallel computers in terms of two- and three-dimensional test cases permitting large deformations.;math.NA
1801.05652;Post-Lie algebra structures for nilpotent Lie algebras;We study post-Lie algebra structures on $(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{n})$ for nilpotent Lie algebras. First we show that if $\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent such that $H^0(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{n})=0$, then also $\mathfrak{n}$ must be nilpotent, of bounded class. For post-Lie algebra structures $x\cdot y$ on pairs of $2$-step nilpotent Lie algebras $(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{n})$ we give necessary and sufficient conditions such that $x\circ y=\frac{1}{2}(x\cdot y+y\cdot x)$ defines a CPA-structure on $\mathfrak{g}$, or on $\mathfrak{n}$. As a corollary we obtain that every LR-structure on a Heisenberg Lie algebra of dimension $n\ge 5$ is complete. Finally we classify all post-Lie algebra structures on $(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{n})$ for $\mathfrak{g}\cong \mathfrak{n}\cong \mathfrak{n}_3$, where $\mathfrak{n}_3$ is the $3$-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra.;math.RA
1801.05653;On the stability of the state 1 in the non-local Fisher-KPP equation in bounded domains;We consider the non-local Fisher-KPP equation on a bounded domain with Neu-mann boundary conditions. Thanks to a Lyapunov function, we prove that under a general hypothesis on the Kernel involved in the non-local term, the homogenous steady state 1 is globally asymptotically stable. This assumption happens to be linked to some conditions given in the literature, which ensure that travelling waves link 0 to 1.;math.AP
1801.05654;Expansions of Iterated Stratonovich Stochastic Integrals of Multiplicities 1 to 4. Combained Approach Based on Generalized Multiple and Repeated Fourier series;The article is devoted to the expansions of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of multiplicities 1 to 4 on the base of the combined approach of generalized multiple and repeated Fourier series. We consider two different parts of the expansion of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals. The mean-square convergence of the first part is proven on the base of generalized multiple Fourier series, converging in the sense of norm in $L_2([t, T]^k),$ $k=1, \ldots, 4.$ The mean-square convergence of the second part is proven on the base of generalized repeated Fourier series, converging pointwise. At that, we do not use iterated Ito stochastic integrals as a tool of the proof and directly consider iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals. The cases of multiple Fourier-Legendre series and multiple trigonometric Fourier series are considered in details. The considered expansions contain only one operation of the limit transition in contrast to its existing analogues. This property is very important for the mean-square approximation of iterated stochastic integrals. The results of the article can be applied to numerical integration of Ito stochastic differential equations.;math.PR
1801.05655;Rate-Distortion Performance of Sequential Massive Random Access to Gaussian Sources with Memory;In Sequential Massive Random Access (SMRA), a set of correlated sources is jointly encoded and stored on a server, and clients want to access to only a subset of the sources. Since the number of simultaneous clients can be huge, the server is only authorized to extract a bitstream from the stored data: no re-encoding can be performed before the transmission of a request. In this paper, we investigate the SMRA performance of lossy source coding of Gaussian sources with memory. In practical applications such as Free Viewpoint Television, this model permits to take into account not only inter but also intra correlation between sources. For this model, we provide the storage and transmission rates that are achievable for SMRA under some distortion constraint, and we consider two particular examples of Gaussian sources with memory.;cs.IT
1801.05663;The scaling limit of the membrane model;On the integer lattice we consider the discrete membrane model, a random interface in which the field has Laplacian interaction. We prove that, under appropriate rescaling, the discrete membrane model converges to the continuum membrane model in $d\ge 2$. Namely, it is shown that the scaling limit in $d=2,\,3$ is a H\"older continuous random field, while in $d\ge 4$ the membrane model converges to a random distribution. As a by-product of the proof in $d=2,\,3$, we obtain the scaling limit of the maximum. This work complements the analogous results of Caravenna and Deuschel (2009) in $d=1$.;math.PR
1801.05669;Solving the triharmonic equation over multi-patch domains using isogeometric analysis;We present a framework for solving the triharmonic equation over bilinearly parameterized planar multi-patch domains by means of isogeometric analysis. Our approach is based on the construction of a globally $C^2$-smooth isogeometric spline space which is used as discretization space. The generated $C^2$-smooth space consists of three different types of isogeometric functions called patch, edge and vertex functions. All functions are entirely local with a small support, and numerical examples indicate that they are well-conditioned. The construction of the functions is simple and works uniformly for all multi-patch configurations. While the patch and edge functions are given by a closed form representation, the vertex functions are obtained by computing the null space of a small system of linear equations. Several examples demonstrate the potential of our approach for solving the triharmonic equation.;math.NA
1801.05674;On the injective dimension of the Jacobson radical;We conjecture that the injective dimension of the Jacobson radical equals the global dimension for Artin algebras. We provide a proof of this conjecture in case the Artin algebra has finite global dimension and in some other cases.;math.RT
1801.05676;A distribution approach to finite-size corrections in Bethe Ansatz solvable models;We present a new and efficient method for deriving finite-size effects in statistical physics models solvable by Bethe Ansatz. It is based on the study of the functional that maps a function to the sum of its evaluations over the Bethe roots. A simple and powerful constraint is derived when applying this functional to infinitely derivable test functions with compact support, that generalizes then to more general test functions. The method is presented in the context of the simple spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain for which we derive the finite-size corrections to leading eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian for any configuration of Bethe numbers with real Bethe roots. The expected results for the central charge and conformal dimensions are recovered.;math-ph
1801.05677;Eisenstein-Kronecker series via the Poincar&#xe9, bundle;A classical construction of Katz gives a purely algebraic construction of Eisenstein--Kronecker series using the Gau\ss--Manin connection on the universal elliptic curve. This approach gives a systematic way to study algebraic and $p$-adic properties of real-analytic Eisenstein series. In the first part of this paper we provide an alternative algebraic construction of Eisenstein--Kronecker series via the Poincar\'e bundle. Building on this, we give in the second part a new conceptional construction of Katz' two-variable $p$-adic Eisenstein measure through $p$-adic theta functions of the Poincar\'e bundle.;math.NT
1801.05679;Zonal and Associated Functions on $SO_{0}(p,q)$ Groups;Explicit expressions for associated spherical functions of $SO(p,q)$ matrix groups are obtained using a generalized hypergeometric series of two variables. In this paper, we present explicit expressions for zonal functions of de Sitter groups and the group of conformal invariance. Moreover, we present a theorem on the transformation of derivative of distributions, concentrated on smooth surfaces, with respect to infinite-dimensional Lie group $C^{\infty}\left(\mathbb{R^{\mathit{n}}},GL(n)\right)$.;math.CA
1801.05681;Mixed Delay Constraints in Wyner&#x27,s Soft-Handoff Network;Wyner's soft-handoff network with mixed delay constraints is considered when neighbouring receivers can cooperate over rate-limited links. Each source message is a combination of independent "fast" and "slow" bits, where the former are subject to a stringent decoding delay. Inner and outer bounds on the capacity region are derived, and the multiplexing gain region is characterized when only transmitters or only receivers cooperate.;cs.IT
1801.05682;Automorphisms of Hilbert schemes of points on a generic projective K3 surface;We study automorphisms of the Hilbert scheme of $n$ points on a generic projective K3 surface $S$, for any $n \geq 2$. We show that the automorphism group of $S^{[n]}$ is either trivial or generated by a non-symplectic involution and we determine numerical and divisorial conditions which allow us to distinguish between the two cases. As an application of these results we prove that, for any $n \geq 2$, there exist infinite values for the degree of $S$ such that $S^{[n]}$ admits a non-natural involution. This provides a generalization of results by Boissi\`ere--Cattaneo--Nieper-Wisskirchen--Sarti for $n=2$.;math.AG
1801.05683;2-hom-associative bialgebras and hom-left symmetric dialgebras;From the definition and properties of unital hom-associative algebras, and the use of the Kaplansky's constructions, we develop new algebraic structures called 2-hom-associative bialgebras, 2-hom-bialgebras, and 2-2-hom-bialgebras. Besides, we devise a construction of hom-left symmetric dialgebras and discuss their main relevant properties.;math.RA
1801.05684;Eigenvector localization in the heavy-tailed random conductance model;We generalize our former localization result about the principal Dirichlet eigenvector of the i.i.d. heavy-tailed random conductance Laplacian to the first $k$ eigenvectors. We overcome the complication that the higher eigenvectors have fluctuating signs by invoking the Bauer-Fike theorem to show that the $k$th eigenvector is close to the principal eigenvector of an auxiliary spectral problem.;math.PR
1801.05687;On the Finiteness of the Derived Equivalence Classes of some Stable Endomorphism Rings;We prove that the stable endomorphism rings of rigid objects in a suitable Frobenius category have only finitely many basic algebras in their derived equivalence class and that these are precisely the stable endomorphism rings of objects obtained by iterated mutation. The main application is to the Homological Minimal Model Programme. For a 3-fold flopping contraction $f \colon X \to \mathrm{Spec}\ R$, where $X$ has only Gorenstein terminal singularities, there is an associated finite dimensional algebra $A_{\mathrm{con}}$ known as the contraction algebra. As a corollary of our main result, there are only finitely many basic algebras in the derived equivalence class of $A_{\mathrm{con}}$ and these are precisely the contraction algebras of maps obtained by a sequence of iterated flops from $f$. This provides evidence towards a key conjecture in the area.;math.RT
1801.05696;Sampled-data implementation of derivative-dependent control using artificial delays;We study a sampled-data implementation of linear controllers that depend on the output and its derivatives. First, we consider an LTI system of relative degree $r\ge 2$ that can be stabilized using $r-1$ output derivatives. Then, we consider PID control of a second order system. In both cases, the Euler approximation is used for the derivatives giving rise to a delayed sampled-data controller. Given a derivative-dependent controller that stabilizes the system, we show how to choose the parameters of the delayed sampled-data controller that preserves the stability under fast enough sampling. The maximum sampling period is obtained from LMIs that are derived using the Taylor's expansion of the delayed terms with the remainders compensated by appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals. Finally, we introduce the event-triggering mechanism that may reduce the amount of sampled control signals used for stabilization.;math.OC
1801.05701;Unlikely intersections between isogeny orbits and curves;Fix an abelian variety $A_0$ and a non-isotrivial abelian scheme over a smooth irreducible curve, both defined over the algebraic numbers. Consider the union of all images of translates of a fixed finite-rank subgroup of $A_0$, also defined over the algebraic numbers, by abelian subvarieties of $A_0$ of codimension at least $k$ under all isogenies between $A_0$ and some fiber of the abelian scheme. We characterize the curves inside the abelian scheme which are defined over the algebraic numbers, dominate the base curve and potentially intersect this set in infinitely many points. Our proof follows the Pila-Zannier strategy.;math.NT

1801.05706;Stability of planar rarefaction wave to 3D full compressible Navier-Stokes equations;We prove the time-asymptotic stability toward planar rarefaction wave for the three-dimensional full compressible Navier-Stokes equations in an infinite long flat nozzle domain $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}^2$. Compared with one-dimensional case, the proof here is based on our new observations on the cancellations on the flux terms and viscous terms due to the underlying wave structures, which are crucial to overcome the difficulties due to the wave propagation along the transverse directions $x_2$ and $x_3$ and its interactions with the planar rarefaction wave in $x_1$ direction.;math.AP
1801.05710;First and second order Central Limit Theorems for the recursive computation of the invariant distribution of a Feller process;This paper studies the convergence of empirical measures of a stochastic approximation toward the invariant distribution of a Feller process. In particular, we provide a general and abstract approach to establish Central Limit Theorems (CLT) with given rate . Moreover, considering weighted empirical measures of a weak order two stochastic approximation, we show its second order convergence while the CLT for standard empirical measures has order one. We also propose various applications: First order CLT for the approximation of Markov Brownian diffusion stationary regimes with Euler scheme (where we recover existing results from literature) and second order CLT for the approximation of Brownian diffusion stationary regimes using Talay scheme (1990) of weak order two.;math.PR

1801.05715;Reconstruction of functions in principal shift-invariant subspaces of mixed Lebesgue spaces;In this paper, we discuss to the nonuniform sampling problem in principal shift-invariant subspaces of mixed Lebesgue spaces. We proposed a fast reconstruction algorithm which allows to exactly reconstruct the functions in the principal shift-invariant subspaces as long as the sampling set $X=\{(x_{j},y_{k}):k,j\in \mathbb{J}\}$ is sufficiently dense. Our results improve the result in \cite{LiLiu}.;math.FA

Let $X=Y(K,K')$ denote the 3-manifold obtained by splicing the complements of $K$ and $K'$. We show that $\text{rank}(\widehat{HF}(X)) \ge \text{rank}(\widehat{HF}(Y))$.;math.GT
1801.05724;On an extremal property of Jordan algebras of Clifford type;If $V$ is a finite-dimensional unital commutative (maybe nonassociative) algebra carrying an associative positive definite bilinear form then there exist a nonzero idempotent $c\ne e$ ($e$ being the algebra unit) of the shortest possible length $|c|^2$. In particular, $|c|^2\le \frac12|e|^2$. We prove that the equality holds exactly when $V$ is a Jordan algebra of Clifford type.;math.RA
1801.05726;A Markov Process Approach to the asymptotic Theory of abstract Cauchy Problems driven by Poisson Processes;In this paper, we employ Markov process theory to prove asymptotic results for a class of stochastic processes which arise as solutions of a stochastic evolution inclusion and are given by the representation formula \begin{align*} \mathbb{X}_{x}(t)=\sum \limits_{m=0}\limits^{\infty}T((t-\alpha_{m})_{+})(x_{x,m})1\hspace{-0,9ex}1_{[\alpha_{m},\alpha_{m+1})}(t), \end{align*} where $(T(t))_{t \geq 0}$ is a (nonlinear) time-continuous, contractive semigroup acting on a separable Banach space $(V,||\cdot||_{V})$, $(\alpha_{m})_{m \in \mathbb{N}}$ is the sequence of arrival times of a homogeneous Poisson process, $x$ is a $V$-valued random variable and $(x_{x,m})_{m \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a recursively defined sequence of $V$-valued random variables, fulfilling $x_{x,0}=x$. It will be demonstrated that $\mathbb{X}_{x}$ is, under some distributional assumptions on the involved random variables, a time-continuous Markov process and that it obeys, under polynomial decay conditions on $T$, the strong law of large numbers (SLLN) and, if the decay rate is sufficiently fast, also the central limit theorem (CLT). Finally, we consider two examples: A nonlinear ordinary differential equation and the (weighted) $p$-Laplacian evolution equation for $p \in (2,\infty)$.;math.PR
1801.05729;Weak Mixing in Switched Systems;Given a switched system, we introduce weakly mixing sets of type 1, 2 and Xiong chaotic sets of type 1, 2 with respect to a given set and show that they are equivalent respectively.;math.DS
1801.05732;Homogeneous deformations of toric pairs;We extend the Altmann--Mavlyutov construction of homogeneous deformations of affine toric varieties to the case of toric pairs $(X, \partial X)$, where $X$ is an affine or projective toric variety and $\partial X$ is its toric boundary. As an application, we generalise a result due to Ilten to the case of Fano toric pairs.;math.AG
1801.05740;Effective sup-norm bounds on average for cusp forms of even weight;Let $\Gamma\subset\mathrm{PSL}_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ be a Fuchsian subgroup of the first kind acting on the upper half-plane $\mathbb{H}$. Consider the $d_{2k}$-dimensional space of cusp forms $\mathcal{S}_{2k}^{\Gamma}$ of weight $2k$ for $\Gamma$, and let $\{f_{1},\ldots,f_{d_{2k}}\}$ be an orthonormal basis of $\mathcal{S}_{2k}^{\Gamma}$ with respect to the Petersson inner product. In this paper we will give effective upper and lower bounds for the supremum of the quantity $S_{2k}^{\Gamma}(z):=\sum_{j=1}^{d_{2k}}\vert f_{j}(z)\vert^{2}\,\mathrm{Im}(z)^{2k}$ as $z$ ranges through $\mathbb{H}$.;math.NT
1801.05748;Supersimple omega-categorical theories and pregeometries;We prove that if $T$ is an $\omega$-categorical supersimple theory with nontrivial dependence (given by forking), then there is a nontrivial regular 1-type over a finite set of reals which is realized by real elements, hence forking induces a nontrivial pregeometry on the solution set of this type and the pregeometry is definable (using only finitely many parameters). The assumption about $\omega$-categoricity is necessary. This result is used to prove the following: If $V$ is a finite relational vocabulary with maximal arity 3 and $T$ is a supersimple $V$-theory with elimination of quantifiers, then $T$ has trivial dependence and finite SU-rank. This immediately gives the following strengthening of a previous result of the author: if $\mathcal{M}$ is a ternary simple homogeneous structure with only finitely many constraints, then $Th(\mathcal{M})$ has trivial dependence and finite SU-rank.;math.LO
1801.05749;On Gaussian random matrices coupled to the discrete Laplacian;We study operators obtained by coupling an $n \times n$ random matrix from one of the Gaussian ensembles to the discrete Laplacian. We find the joint distribution of the eigenvalues and resonances of such operators. This is one of the possible mathematical models for quantum scattering in a complex physical system with one semi-infinite lead attached.;math-ph
1801.05751;On the equidistribution of some Hodge loci;We prove the equidistribution of the Hodge locus for certain non-isotrivial, polarized variations of Hodge structure of weight $2$ with $h^{2,0}=1$ over complex, quasi-projective curves. Given some norm condition, we also give an asymptotic on the growth of the Hodge locus. In particular, this implies the equidistribution of elliptic fibrations in quasi-polarized, non-isotrivial families of $K3$ surfaces.;math.AG
1801.05753;The Lipman-Zariski conjecture in low genus;We prove the Lipman-Zariski conjecture for complex surface singularities of genus one, and also for those of genus two whose link is not a rational homology sphere. As an application, we characterize complex $2$-tori as the only normal compact complex surfaces whose smooth locus has trivial tangent bundle. We also deduce that all complex-projective surfaces with locally free and generically nef tangent sheaf are smooth, and we classify them.;math.AG
1801.05758;On Grothendieck&#x27,s section conjecture for orbicurves;As already noted by Niels Borne and Michel Emsalem, there is a natural generalization of the section conjecture for proper orbicurves. Combined with the reformulation by Niels Borne and Angelo Vistoli of the conjecture in terms of the \'etale fundamental gerbe, this suggests an even stronger conjecture for orbicurves, asking an equivalence of categories instead of a mere bijection. We prove that the three versions of the conjecture are in fact equivalent, and that "injectivity" (i.e. full faithfulness) holds in the case of orbicurves. As a byproduct, we obtain a new proof of the fact that the section conjecture for proper curves implies the section conjecture for open curves.;math.AG
1801.05762;Heights in families of abelian varieties and the Geometric Bogomolov Conjecture;On an abelian scheme over a smooth curve over $\overline{\mathbb Q}$ a symmetric relatively ample line bundle defines a fiberwise N\'eon-Tate height. If the base curve is inside a projective space, we also have a height on its $\overline{\mathbb Q}$-points that serves as a measure of each fiber, an abelian variety. Silverman proved an asymptotic equality between these two heights on a curve in the abelian scheme. In this paper we prove an inequality between these heights on a subvariety of any dimension of the abelian scheme. As an application we prove the Geometric Bogomolov Conjecture for the function field of a curve defined over $\overline{\mathbb Q}$. Using Moriwaki's height we sketch how to extend our result when the base field of the curve has characteristic 0.;math.NT
1801.05768;The Asymptotic Capacity of Private Search;The private search problem is introduced, where a dataset comprised of $L$ i.i.d. records is replicated across $N$ non-colluding servers, each record takes values uniformly from an alphabet of size $K$, and a user wishes to search for all records that match a privately chosen value, without revealing any information about the chosen value to any individual server. The capacity of private search is the maximum number of bits of desired information that can be retrieved per bit of download. The asymptotic (large $K$) capacity of private search is shown to be $1-1/N$, even as the scope of private search is further generalized to allow approximate (OR) search over a number of realizations that grows with $K$. The results are based on the asymptotic behavior of a new converse bound for private information retrieval with arbitrarily dependent messages.;cs.IT
1801.05774;Product of three octonions;This paper is devoted to octonions that are the eight-dimensional hypercomplex numbers characterized by multiplicative non-associativity. The decomposition of the product of three octonions with the conjugated central factor into the sum of mutually orthogonal anticommutator, commutator and associator, is introduced in an obvious way by commuting of factors and alternating the multiplication order. The commutator is regarded as a generalization of the cross product to the case of three arguments both for quaternions and for octonions. It is verified that the resulting additive decomposition is equivalent to the known solution derived and presented by S. Okubo in a cumbersome form.;math.RA
1801.05775;Local Coordinate Spaces: a proposed unification of manifolds and fiber bundles, and associated machinery;This paper presents a unified view of manifolds and fiber bundles, which, while superficially different, have strong parallels. It introduces the notions of an m-atlas and of a local coordinate space, and shows that special cases are equivalent to fiber bundles and manifolds. Along the way it defines some convenient notation, defines categories of atlases, and constructs potentially useful functors.;math.AT
1801.05777;On the number of maximal paths in directed last-passage percolation;We show that the number of maximal paths in directed last-passage percolation on the hypercubic lattice ${\mathbb Z}^d$ $(d\geq2)$ in which weights take finitely many values is typically exponentially large.;math.PR
1801.05779;Rationality of Darmon points over genus fields of non-maximal orders;Stark-Heegner points, also known as Darmon points, were introduced by H. Darmon as certain local points on rational elliptic curves, conjecturally defined over abelian extensions of real quadratic fields. The rationality conjecture for these points is only known in the unramified case, namely, when these points are specializations of global points defined over the strict Hilbert class field $H^+_F$ of the real quadratic field $F$ and twisted by (unramified) quadratic characters of $Gal(H_c^+/F)$. We extend these results to the situation of ramified quadratic characters, more precisely, we show that Darmon points of conductor $c\geq 1$ twisted by quadratic characters of $G_c^+=Gal(H_c^+/F)$, where $H_c^+$ is the strict ring class field of $F$ of conductor $c$, come from rational points on the elliptic curve defined over $H_c^+$.;math.NT
1801.05791;Pathwise Convergence of the Hard Spheres Kac Process;We derive two estimates for the deviation of the $N$-particle, hard-spheres Kac process from the corresponding Boltzmann equation, measured in expected Wasserstein distance. Particular care is paid to the long-time properties of our estimates, exploiting the stability properties of the limiting Boltzmann equation at the level of realisations of the interacting particle system. As a consequence, we obtain an estimate for the propagation of chaos, uniformly in time and with polynomial rates, as soon as the initial data has a $k^\mathrm{th}$ moment, $k&gt,2$. Our approach is similar to Kac's proposal of relating the long-time behaviour of the particle system to that of the limit equation. Along the way, we prove a new estimate for the continuity of the Boltzmann flow measured in Wasserstein distance.;math.PR
1801.05792;A Missing Proof of The Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem;A short and direct proof of the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem \`{a} la Amartya Sen's proof of Arrow's impossibility theorem is given.;math.CO
1801.05794;An unconditionally stable semi-implicit CutFEM for an interaction problem between an elastic membrane and an incompressible fluid;In this paper we introduce a finite element method for the Stokes equations with a massless immersed membrane. This membrane applies normal and tangential forces affecting the velocity and pressure of the fluid. Additionally, the points representing this membrane move with the local fluid velocity. We design and implement a high-accuracy cut finite element method (CutFEM) which enables the use of a structured mesh that is not aligned with the immersed membrane and then we formulate a time discretization that yields an unconditionally energy stable scheme. We prove that the stability is not restricted by the parameter choices that constrained previous finite element immersed boundary methods and illustrate the theoretical results with numerical simulations.;math.NA
1801.05799;Symmetrization, factorization and arithmetic of quasi-Banach function spaces;We investigate relations between symmetrizations of quasi-Banach function spaces and constructions such as Calderon-Lozanovskii spaces, pointwise product spaces and pointwise multipliers. We show that under reasonable assumptions the symmetrization commutes with these operations. We determine also the spaces of pointwise multipliers between Lorentz spaces and Cesaro spaces. Developed methods may be regarded as an arithmetic of quasi-Banach function spaces and proofs of Theorems 3, 4 and 6 give a kind of tutorial for these methods. Finally, the above results will be used in proofs of some factorization results.;math.FA
1801.05801;Invariant random subgroups of groups acting on rooted trees;We investigate invariant random subgroups in groups acting on rooted trees. Let $\mathrm{Alt}_f(T)$ be the group of finitary even automorphisms of the $d$-ary rooted tree $T$. We prove that a nontrivial ergodic IRS of $\mathrm{Alt}_f(T)$ that acts without fixed points on the boundary of $T$ contains a level stabilizer, in particular it is the random conjugate of a finite index subgroup. <br />Applying the technique to branch groups we prove that an ergodic IRS in a finitary regular branch group contains the derived subgroup of a generalized rigid level stabilizer. We also prove that every weakly branch group has continuum many distinct atomless ergodic IRS's. This extends a result of Benli, Grigorchuk and Nagnibeda who exhibit a group of intermediate growth with this property.;math.GR
1801.05834;Positivity Results for spaces of rational curves;Let $X$ be a very general hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$. We investigate positivity properties of the spaces $R_e(X)$ of degree $e$ rational curves in $X$. We show that for small $e$, $R_e(X)$ has no rational curves meeting the locus of smooth embedded curves. We show that for $n \leq d$, there are no rational curves in the locus $Y \subset X$ swept out by lines. And we exhibit differential forms on a smooth compactification of $R_e(X)$ for every $e$ and $n-2 \geq d \geq \frac{n+1}{2}$.;math.AG
1801.05838;Revisiting the Problem of Recovering Functions in $\Bbb R^{n}$ by Integration on $k$ Dimensional Planes;The aim of this paper is to present inversion methods for the classical Radon transform which is defined on a family of $k$ dimensional planes in $\Bbb R^{n}$ where $1\leq k\leq n - 2$. For these values of $k$ the dimension of the set $\mathcal{H}(n,k)$, of all $k$ dimensional planes in $\Bbb R^{n}$, is greater than $n$ and thus in order to obtain a well-posed problem one should choose proper subsets of $\mathcal{H}(n,k)$. We present inversion methods for some prescribed subsets of $\mathcal{H}(n,k)$ which are of dimension $n$.;math.AP
1801.05842;Lipschitz contact equivalence and real analytic functions;We study the properties of the a complete invariant of the analytic function of two variables with respect to the Lipschitz contact equivalence. This invariant is called pizza. We prove that the pizza of real analytic functions has some continuity properties.;math.MG
1801.05844;Performance Analysis of Joint Pairing and Mode Selection in D2D Communications with FD Radios;In cellular-D2D networks, users can select the communication mode either direct and form D2D links or indirect and communicate with BS. In former case, users should perform pairing selection and choose their pairs. The main focus in this paper is proposing an analytical framework by using tools from stochastic geometry to address these two issues, i.e. i) mode selection for the user devices to be established in either cellular or D2D mode, which is done based on received power from BS influenced by a bias factor, and ii) investigation of choosing nth-nearest neighbor as the serving node for the receiver of interest, by considering full-duplex (FD) radios as well as half- duplex (HD) in the D2D links. The analytic and simulation results demonstrate that even though the bias factor determines the throughput of each mode, it does not have any influence on the system sum throughput. Furthermore, we demonstrate that despite of suffering from self-interference, FD-D2D results in higher system sum throughput as well as higher coverage probability in comparison to its counterpart, namely purely HD- D2D network.;cs.IT
1801.05848;Random Construction of Partial MDS Codes;This work deals with partial MDS (PMDS) codes, a special class of locally repairable codes, used for distributed storage system. We first show that a known construction of these codes, using Gabidulin codes, can be extended to use any maximum rank distance code. Then we define a standard form for the generator matrices of PMDS codes and use this form to give an algebraic description of PMDS generator matrices. This implies that over a sufficiently large finite field a randomly chosen generator matrix in PMDS standard form generates a PMDS code with high probability. This also provides sufficient conditions on the field size for the existence of PMDS codes.;cs.IT
1801.05859;A Kotel&#x27,nikov Representation for Wavelets;This paper presents a wavelet representation using baseband signals, by exploiting Kotel'nikov results. Details of how to obtain the processes of envelope and phase at low frequency are shown. The archetypal interpretation of wavelets as an analysis with a filter bank of constant quality factor is revisited on these bases. It is shown that if the wavelet spectral support is limited into the band $[f_m,f_M]$, then an orthogonal analysis is guaranteed provided that $f_M \leq 3f_m$, a quite simple result, but that invokes some parallel with the Nyquist rate. Nevertheless, in cases of orthogonal wavelets whose spectrum does not verify this condition, it is shown how to construct an "equivalent" filter bank with no spectral overlapping.;math.CA
1801.05870;Quantized Compressive Sensing with RIP Matrices: The Benefit of Dithering;Quantized compressive sensing (QCS) deals with the problem of coding compressive measurements of low-complexity signals with quantized, finite precision representations, i.e., a mandatory process involved in any practical sensing model. While the resolution of this quantization clearly impacts the quality of signal reconstruction, there actually exist incompatible combinations of quantization functions and sensing matrices that proscribe arbitrarily low reconstruction error when the number of measurements increases. This work shows that a large class of random matrix constructions known to respect the restricted isometry property (RIP) is "compatible" with a simple scalar and uniform quantization if a uniform random vector, or a random dither, is added to the compressive signal measurements before quantization. In the context of estimating low-complexity signals (e.g., sparse or compressible signals, low-rank matrices) from their quantized observations, this compatibility is demonstrated by the existence of (at least) one signal reconstruction method, the projected back projection (PBP), whose reconstruction error decays when the number of measurements increases. Interestingly, given one RIP matrix and a single realization of the dither, a small reconstruction error can be proved to hold uniformly for all signals in the considered low-complexity set. We confirm these observations numerically in several scenarios involving sparse signals, low-rank matrices, and compressible signals, with various RIP matrix constructions such as sub-Gaussian random matrices and random partial discrete cosine transform (DCT) matrices.;cs.IT
1801.05873;Sparse Activity Detection for Massive Connectivity;This paper considers the massive connectivity application in which a large number of potential devices communicate with a base-station (BS) in a sporadic fashion. The detection of device activity pattern together with the estimation of the channel are central problems in such a scenario. Due to the large number of potential devices in the network, the devices need to be assigned non-orthogonal signature sequences. The main objective of this paper is to show that by using random signature sequences and by exploiting sparsity in the user activity pattern, the joint user detection and channel estimation problem can be formulated as a compressed sensing single measurement vector (SMV) problem or multiple measurement vector (MMV) problem, depending on whether the BS has a single antenna or multiple antennas, and be efficiently solved using an approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm. This paper proposes an AMP algorithm design that exploits the statistics of the wireless channel and provides an analytical characterization of the probabilities of false alarm and missed detection by using the state evolution. We consider two cases depending on whether the large-scale component of the channel fading is known at the BS and design the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) denoiser for AMP according to the channel statistics. Simulation results demonstrate the substantial advantage of exploiting the statistical channel information in AMP design, however, knowing the large-scale fading component does not offer tangible benefits. For the multiple-antenna case, we employ two different AMP algorithms, namely the AMP with vector denoiser and the parallel AMP-MMV, and quantify the benefit of deploying multiple antennas at the BS.;cs.IT
1801.05875;An Ultra-Weak Discontinuous Galerkin Method for Schr&#xf6,dinger Equation in One Dimension;In this paper, we develop an ultra-weak discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method to solve the one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Stability conditions and error estimates are derived for the scheme with a general class of numerical fluxes. The error estimates are based on detailed analysis of the projection operator associated with each individual flux choice. Depending on the parameters, we find out that in some cases, the projection can be defined element-wise, facilitating analysis. In most cases, the projection is global, and its analysis depends on the resulting $2\times2$ block-circulant matrix structures. For a large class of parameter choices, optimal $\textit{a priori}$ $L^2$ error estimates can be obtained. Numerical examples are provided verifying theoretical results.;math.NA
1801.05877;Nonstandard local discontinuous Galerkin methods for fully nonlinear second order elliptic and parabolic equations in high dimensions;This paper is concerned with developing accurate and efficient numerical methods for fully nonlinear second order elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) in multiple spatial dimensions. It presents a general framework for constructing high order local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) methods for approximating viscosity solutions of these fully nonlinear PDEs. The proposed LDG methods are natural extensions of a narrow-stencil finite difference framework recently proposed by the authors for approximating viscosity solutions. The idea of the methodology is to use multiple approximations of first and second order derivatives as a way to resolve the potential low regularity of the underlying viscosity solution. Consistency and generalized monotonicity properties are proposed that ensure the numerical operator approximates the differential operator. The resulting algebraic system has several linear equations coupled with only one nonlinear equation that is monotone in many of its arguments. The structure can be explored to design nonlinear solvers. This paper also presents and analyzes numerical results for several numerical test problems in two dimensions which are used to gauge the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed LDG methods.;math.NA
1801.05879;Analysis of the Vanishing Moment Method and its Finite Element Approximations for Second-order Linear Elliptic PDEs in Non-divergence Form;This paper is concerned with continuous and discrete approximations of $W^{2,p}$ strong solutions of second-order linear elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) in non-divergence form. The continuous approximation of these equations is achieved through the Vanishing Moment Method (VMM) which adds a small biharmonic term to the PDE. The structure of the new fourth-order PDE is a natural fit for Galerkin-type methods unlike the original second order equation since the highest order term is in divergence form. The well-posedness of the weak form of the perturbed fourth order equation is shown as well as error estimates for approximating the strong solution of the original second-order PDE. A $C^1$ finite element method is then proposed for the fourth order equation, and its existence and uniqueness of solutions as well as optimal error estimates in the $H^2$ norm are shown. Lastly, numerical tests are given to show the validity of the method.;math.NA
1801.05880;Sums of Kloosterman sums over primes in an arithmetic progression;For $q$ prime, $X \geq 1$ and coprime $u,v \in \mathbb{N}$ we estimate the sums \begin{equation*} \sum_{\substack{p \leq X \substack p \equiv u \hspace{-0.25cm} \mod{v} p \text{ prime}}} \text{Kl}_2(p,q), \end{equation*} where $\text{Kl}_2(p,q)$ denotes a normalised Kloosterman sum with modulus $q$. This is a sparse analogue of a recent theorem due to Blomer, Fouvry, Kowalski, Michel and Mili\'cevi\'c showing cancellation amongst sums of Kloosterman sums over primes in short intervals. We use an optimisation argument inspired by Fouvry, Kowalski and Michel. Our argument compares three different bounds for bilinear forms involving Kloosterman sums. The first input in this method is a bilinear bound we prove using uniform asymptotics for oscillatory integrals due to Kiral, Petrow and Young. In contrast with the case when the sum runs over all primes, we exploit cancellation over a sum of stationary phase integrals that result from a Voronoi type summation. The second and third inputs are deep bilinear bounds for Kloosterman sums due to Fouvry-Kowalski-Michel and Kowalski-Michel-Sawin.;math.NT
1801.05887;Uniform Ergodicity for Brownian Motion in a Bounded Convex Set;We consider an n-dimensional Brownian Motion trapped inside a bounded convex set by normally-reflecting boundaries. It is well-known that this process is uniformly ergodic. However, the rates of this ergodicity are not well-understood, especially in the regime of very high-dimensional sets. Here we present new bounds on these rates for convex sets with a given diameter. Our bounds do not depend upon the smoothness of the boundary nor the value of the ambient dimension, n.;math.PR
1801.05892;Evaluating High Order Discontinuous Galerkin Discretization of the Boltzmann Collision Integral in $O(N^2)$ Operations Using the Discrete Fourier Transform;We present a numerical algorithm for evaluating the Boltzmann collision operator with $O(N^2)$ operations based on high order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations in the velocity variable. To formulate the approach, Galerkin projection of the collision operator is written in the form of a bilinear circular convolution. An application of the discrete Fourier transform allows to rewrite the six fold convolution sum as a three fold weighted convolution sum in the frequency space. The new algorithm is implemented and tested in the spatially homogeneous case, and results in a considerable improvement in speed as compared to the direct evaluation. Simultaneous and separate evaluations of the gain and loss terms of the collision operator were considered. Less numerical error was observed in the conserved quantities with simultaneous evaluation.;math.NA

1801.05894;Deep Learning: An Introduction for Applied Mathematicians;Multilayered artificial neural networks are becoming a pervasive tool in a host of application fields. At the heart of this deep learning revolution are familiar concepts from applied and computational mathematics, notably, in calculus, approximation theory, optimization and linear algebra. This article provides a very brief introduction to the basic ideas that underlie deep learning from an applied mathematics perspective. Our target audience includes postgraduate and final year undergraduate students in mathematics who are keen to learn about the area. The article may also be useful for instructors in mathematics who wish to enliven their classes with references to the application of deep learning techniques. We focus on three fundamental questions: what is a deep neural network? how is a network trained? what is the stochastic gradient method? We illustrate the ideas with a short MATLAB code that sets up and trains a network. We also show the use of state-of-the art software on a large scale image classification problem. We finish with references to the current literature.;math.HO

For two-dimensional bases, we show analogous results in the more general case of families of varieties admitting a good minimal model.;math.AG

As an application, we prove Donaldson's conjecture on the equivalence between geodesic stability and existence of cscK when $Aut_0(M,J)\neq0$. Moreover, we also show that when $Aut_0(M,J)\neq0$, the properness of $K$-energy with respect to a suitably defined distance implies the existence of cscK.;math.DG
1801.05910;Dual Third-order Jacobsthal Quaternions;In 2016, Y\"uce and Torunbalc\i\ Ayd\i n \cite{Yuc-Tor} defined dual Fibonacci quaternions. In this paper, we defined the dual third-order Jacobsthal quaternions and dual third-order Jacobsthal-Lucas quaternions. Also, we investigated the relations between the dual third-order Jacobsthal quaternions and third-order Jacobsthal numbers. Furthermore, we gave some their quadratic properties, the summations, the Binet's formulas and Cassini-like identities for these quaternions.;math.RA
1801.05914;The De Bruijn-Newman constant is non-negative;For each $t \in {\bf R}$, define the entire function $$ H_t(x) := \int_0^\infty e^{tu^2} \Phi(u) \cos(xu)\ du$$ where $\Phi$ is the super-exponentially decaying function $$ \Phi(u) := \sum_{n=1}^\infty (2\pi^2 n^4 e^{9u} - 3\pi n^2 e^{5u} ) \exp(-\pi n^2 e^{4u} ).$$ Newman showed that there exists a finite constant $\Lambda$ (the \emph{de Bruijn-Newman constant}) such that the zeroes of $H_t$ are all real precisely when $t \geq \Lambda$. The Riemann hypothesis is the equivalent to the assertion $\Lambda \leq 0$, and Newman conjectured the complementary bound $\Lambda \geq 0$. <br />In this paper we establish Newman's conjecture. The argument proceeds by assuming for contradiction that $\Lambda &lt, 0$, and then analyzing the dynamics of zeroes of $H_t$ (building on the work of Csordas, Smith, and Varga) to obtain increasingly strong control on the zeroes of $H_t$ in the range $\Lambda &lt, t \leq 0$, until one establishes that the zeroes of $H_0$ are in local equilibrium, in the sense that locally behave (on average) as if they were equally spaced in an arithmetic progression, with gaps staying close to the global average gap size. But this latter claim is inconsistent with the known results about the local distribution of zeroes of the Riemann zeta function, such as the pair correlation estimates of Montgomery.;math.NT
1801.05919;Rate-Optimal Streaming Codes for Channels with Burst and Isolated Erasures;Recovery of data packets from packet erasures in a timely manner is critical for many streaming applications. An early paper by Martinian and Sundberg introduced a framework for streaming codes and designed rate-optimal codes that permit delay-constrained recovery from an erasure burst of length up to $B$. A recent work by Badr et al. extended this result and introduced a sliding-window channel model $\mathcal{C}(N,B,W)$. Under this model, in a sliding-window of width $W$, one of the following erasure patterns are possible (i) a burst of length at most $B$ or (ii) at most $N$ (possibly non-contiguous) arbitrary erasures. Badr et al. obtained a rate upper bound for streaming codes that can recover with a time delay $T$, from any erasure patterns permissible under the $\mathcal{C}(N,B,W)$ model. However, constructions matching the bound were absent, except for a few parameter sets. In this paper, we present an explicit family of codes that achieves the rate upper bound for all feasible parameters $N$, $B$, $W$ and $T$.;cs.IT
1801.05921;Moment inequalities for matrix-valued U-statistics of order 2;We present Rosenthal-type moment inequalities for matrix-valued U-statistics of order 2.

One of our main technical tools, a version of the non-commutative Khintchine inequality for the spectral norm of the Rademacher chaos, could be of independent interest.;math.PR
1801.05926;The Utility Cost of Robust Privacy Guarantees;Consider a data publishing setting for a data set with public and private features. The objective of the publisher is to maximize the amount of information about the public features in a revealed data set, while keeping the information leaked about the private features bounded. The goal of this paper is to analyze the performance of privacy mechanisms that are constructed to match the distribution learned from the data set. Two distinct scenarios are considered: (i) mechanisms are designed to provide a privacy guarantee for the learned distribution, and (ii) mechanisms are designed to provide a privacy guarantee for every distribution in a given neighborhood of the learned distribution. For the first scenario, given any privacy mechanism, upper bounds on the difference between the privacy-utility guarantees for the learned and true distributions are presented. In the second scenario, upper bounds on the reduction in utility incurred by providing a uniform privacy guarantee are developed.;cs.IT
1801.05928;On partitions into squares of distinct integers whose reciprocals sum to 1;In 1963, Graham proved that all integers greater than 77 (but not 77 itself) can be partitioned into distinct positive integers whose reciprocals sum to 1. He further conjectured that for any sufficiently large integer, it can be partitioned into squares of distinct positive integers whose reciprocals sum to 1. In this study, we establish the exact bound for existence of such partitions by proving that 8542 is the largest integer with no such partition.;math.NT
1801.05934;Condensation of Non-Reversible Zero-Range Processes;In this article, we investigate the condensation phenomena for a class of nonreversible zero-range processes on a fixed finite set. By establishing a novel inequality bounding the capacity between two sets, and by developing a robust framework to perform quantitative analysis on the metastability of non-reversible processes, we prove that the condensed site of the corresponding zero-range processes approximately behaves as a Markov chain on the underlying graph whose jump rate is proportional to the capacity with respect to the underlying random walk. The results presented in the current paper complete the generalization of the work of Beltran and Landim [4] on reversible zero-range processes, and that of Landim [22] on totally asymmetric zero-range processes on a one-dimensional discrete torus.;math.PR
1801.05935;Computation of the Maximum Likelihood estimator in low-rank Factor Analysis;Factor analysis, a classical multivariate statistical technique is popularly used as a fundamental tool for dimensionality reduction in statistics, econometrics and data science. Estimation is often carried out via the Maximum Likelihood (ML) principle, which seeks to maximize the likelihood under the assumption that the positive definite covariance matrix can be decomposed as the sum of a low rank positive semidefinite matrix and a diagonal matrix with nonnegative entries. This leads to a challenging rank constrained nonconvex optimization problem. We reformulate the low rank ML Factor Analysis problem as a nonlinear nonsmooth semidefinite optimization problem, study various structural properties of this reformulation and propose fast and scalable algorithms based on difference of convex (DC) optimization. Our approach has computational guarantees, gracefully scales to large problems, is applicable to situations where the sample covariance matrix is rank deficient and adapts to variants of the ML problem with additional constraints on the problem parameters. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the significant usefulness of our approach over existing state-of-the-art approaches.;math.OC
1801.05936;Gradient Estimates and Ergodicity for SDEs Driven by Multiplicative L&#xe9,vy Noises via Coupling;We consider SDEs driven by multiplicative pure jump L\'{e}vy noises, where L\'evy processes are not necessarily comparable to $\alpha$-stable-like processes. By assuming that the SDE has a unique solution, we obtain gradient estimates of the associated semigroup when the drift term is locally H\"{o}lder continuous, and we establish the ergodicity of the process both in the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance and the total variation, when the coefficients are dissipative for large distances. The proof is based on a new explicit Markov coupling for SDEs driven by multiplicative pure jump L\'{e}vy noises, which is derived for the first time in this paper.;math.PR
1801.05948;Uplink Coverage Performance of an Underlay Drone Cell for Temporary Events;Using a drone as an aerial base station (ABS) to provide coverage to users on the ground is envisaged as a promising solution for beyond fifth generation (beyond-5G) wireless networks. While the literature to date has examined downlink cellular networks with ABSs, we consider an uplink cellular network with an ABS. Specifically, we analyze the use of an underlay ABS to provide coverage for a temporary event, such as a sporting event or a concert in a stadium. Using stochastic geometry, we derive the analytical expressions for the uplink coverage probability of the terrestrial base station (TBS) and the ABS. The results are expressed in terms of (i) the Laplace transforms of the interference power distribution at the TBS and the ABS and (ii) the distance distribution between the ABS and an independently and uniformly distributed (i.u.d.) ABS-supported user equipment and between the ABS and an i.u.d. TBS-supported user equipment. The accuracy of the analytical results is verified by Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show that varying the ABS height leads to a trade-off between the uplink coverage probability of the TBS and the ABS. In addition, assuming a quality of service of 90% at the TBS, an uplink coverage probability of the ABS of over 85% can be achieved, with the ABS deployed at or below its optimal height of typically between 250-500 m for the considered setup.;cs.IT
1801.05951;Quadratically Constrained Myopic Adversarial Channels;We study communication in the presence of a jamming adversary where quadratic power constraints are imposed on the transmitter and the jammer. The jamming signal is allowed to be a function of the codebook, and a noncausal but noisy observation of the transmitted codeword. For a certain range of the noise-to-signal ratios (NSRs) of the transmitter and the jammer, we are able to characterize the capacity of this channel under deterministic encoding and/or stochastic encoding, i.e., with no common randomness between the encoder/decoder pair. For the remaining NSR regimes, we determine the capacity under the assumption of a small amount of common randomness (at most $2\log(n)$ bits in one sub-regime, and at most $\Omega(n^{1+\varepsilon})$ bits for any $\varepsilon&gt,0$ in the other sub-regime) available to the encoder-decoder pair. Our proof techniques involve a novel myopic list-decoding result for achievability, and a Plotkin-type push attack for the converse in a subregion of the NSRs, both of which which may be of independent interest. We also give bounds on the secrecy capacity of this channel.;cs.IT

1801.05963;Formula for calculating the Wiener polarity index with applications to benzenoid graphs and phenylenes;The Wiener polarity index of a graph is defined as the number of unordered pairs of vertices at distance three. In recent years, this topological index was extensively studied since it has many known applications in chemistry and also in network theory. In this paper, we generalize the result of Behmaram, Yousefi-Azari, and Ashrafi proved in 2012 for calculating the Wiener polarity index of a graph. An important advantage of our generalization is that it can be used for graphs that contain $4$-cycles and also for graphs whose different cycles have more than one common edge. In addition, using the main result a closed formula for the Wiener polarity index is derived for phenylenes and recalculated for catacondensed benzenoid graphs. The catacondensed benzenoid graphs and phenylenes attaining the extremal values with respect to the Wiener polarity index are also characterized.;math.CO
1801.05965;The Complexity of Combinations of Qualitative Constraint Satisfaction Problems;The CSP of a first-order theory $T$ is the problem of deciding for a given finite set $S$ of atomic formulas whether $T \cup S$ is satisfiable. Let $T_1$ and $T_2$ be two theories with countably infinite models and disjoint signatures. Nelson and Oppen presented conditions that imply decidability (or polynomial-time decidability) of $\mathrm{CSP}(T_1 \cup T_2)$ under the assumption that $\mathrm{CSP}(T_1)$ and $\mathrm{CSP}(T_2)$ are decidable (or polynomial-time decidable). We show that for a large class of $\omega$-categorical theories $T_1, T_2$ the Nelson-Oppen conditions are not only sufficient, but also necessary for polynomial-time tractability of $\mathrm{CSP}(T_1 \cup T_2)$ (unless P=NP).;math.LO
1801.05966;Towards probabilistic partial metric spaces: Diagonals between distance distributions;The quantale of distance distributions is of fundamental importance for understanding probabilistic metric spaces as enriched categories. Motivated by the categorical interpretation of partial metric spaces, we are led to investigate the quantaloid of diagonals between distance distributions, which is expected to establish the categorical foundation of probabilistic partial metric spaces. Observing that the quantale of distance distributions w.r.t. an arbitrary continuous t-norm is non-divisible, we precisely characterize diagonals between distance distributions, and prove that one-step functions are the only distance distributions on which the set of diagonals coincides with the generated down set.;math.GN
1801.05973;A combinatorial approach to Rauzy-type dynamics II: the labelling method and a second proof of the KZB classification theorem;Rauzy-type dynamics are group actions on a collection of combinatorial objects. The first and best known example (the Rauzy dynamics) concerns an action on permutations, associated to interval exchange transformations (IET) for the Poincar\'e map on compact orientable translation surfaces. The equivalence classes on the objects induced by the group action have been classified by Kontsevich and Zorich, and by Boissy through methods involving both combinatorics algebraic geometry, topology and dynamical systems. Our first paper proposed an ad hoc combinatorial proof of this classification. In this paper we define a general method, called the labelling method, which allows one to classify Rauzy-type dynamics in a much more systematic way. We apply the method to the Rauzy dynamics and obtain a second combinatorial proof of the classification.;math.CO
1801.05975;Groups whose elements are not conjugate to their powers;We call a finite group irrational if none of its elements is conjugate to a distinct power of itself.

1801.05977;An FFT-based algorithm for efficient computation of Green&#x27,s functions for the Helmholtz and Maxwell&#x27,s equations in periodic domains;The integral equation method is widely used in numerical simulations of 2D/3D acoustic and electromagnetic scattering problems, which needs a large number of values of the Green's functions. A significant topic is the scattering problems in periodic domains, where the corresponding Green's functions are quasi-periodic. The quasi-periodic Green's functions are defined by series that converge too slowly to be used for calculations. Many mathematicians have developed several efficient numerical methods to calculate quasi-periodic Green's functions. In this paper, we will propose a new FFT-based fast algorithm to compute the 2D/3D quasi-periodic Green's functions for both the Helmholtz equations and Maxwell's equations. The convergence results and error estimates are also investigated in this paper. Further, the numerical examples are given to show that, when a large number of values are needed, the new algorithm is very competitive.;math.NA
1801.05979;On Krull-Gabriel dimension and Galois coverings;Assume that $K$ is an algebraically closed field, $R$ a locally support-finite locally bounded $K$-category, $G$ a torsion-free admissible group of $K$-linear automorphisms of $R$ and $A=R\slash G$. We show that the Krull-Gabriel dimension $KG(R)$ of $R$ is finite if and only if the Krull-Gabriel dimension $KG(A)$ of $A$ is finite. In these cases $KG(R)=KG(A)$. We apply this result to determine the Krull-Gabriel dimension of standard selfinjective algebras of polynomial growth. Finally, we show that there are no super-decomposable pure-injective modules over standard selfinjective algebras of domestic type.;math.RT
1801.05981;Doubling Algorithms for Stationary Distributions of Fluid Queues: A Probabilistic Interpretation;Fluid queues are mathematical models frequently used in stochastic modelling. Their stationary distributions involve a key matrix recording the conditional probabilities of returning to an initial level from above, often known in the literature as the matrix $\Psi$. Here, we present a probabilistic interpretation of the family of algorithms known as \emph{doubling}, which are currently the most effective algorithms for computing the return probability matrix $\Psi$. <br />To this end, we first revisit the links described in \cite{ram99, soares02} between fluid queues and Quasi-Birth-Death processes, in particular, we give new probabilistic interpretations for these connections. We generalize this framework to give a probabilistic meaning for the initial step of doubling algorithms, and include also an interpretation for the iterative step of these algorithms. Our work is the first probabilistic interpretation available for doubling algorithms.;math.PR
1801.05989;Code Constructions for Distributed Storage With Low Repair Bandwidth and Low Repair Complexity;We present the construction of a family of erasure correcting codes for distributed storage that achieve low repair bandwidth and complexity at the expense of a lower fault tolerance. The construction is based on two classes of codes, where the primary goal of the first class of codes is to provide fault tolerance, while the second class aims at reducing the repair bandwidth and repair complexity. The repair procedure is a two- step procedure where parts of the failed node are repaired in the first step using the first code. The downloaded symbols during the first step are cached in the memory and used to repair the remaining erased data symbols at minimal additional read cost during the second step. The first class of codes is based on MDS codes modified using piggybacks, while the second class is designed to reduce the number of additional symbols that need to be downloaded to repair the remaining erased symbols. We numerically show that the proposed codes achieve better repair bandwidth compared to MDS codes, codes constructed using piggybacks, and local reconstruction/Pyramid codes, while a better repair complexity is achieved when compared to MDS, Zigzag, Pyramid codes, and codes constructed using piggybacks.;cs.IT
1801.05993;Direct sampling method for imaging small dielectric inhomogeneities: analysis and improvement;The direct sampling method (DSM) has been introduced for non-iterative imaging of small inhomogeneities and is known to be fast, robust, and effective for inverse scattering problems. However, to the best of our knowledge, a full analysis of the behavior of the DSM has not been provided yet. Such an analysis is proposed here within the framework of the asymptotic hypothesis in the 2D case leading to the expression of the DSM indicator function in terms of the Bessel function of order zero and the sizes, shapes and permittivities of the inhomogeneities. Thanks to this analytical expression the limitations of the DSM method when one of the inhomogeneities is smaller and/or has lower permittivity than the others is exhibited and illustrated. An improved DSM is proposed to overcome this intrinsic limitation in the case of multiple incident waves. Then we show that both the traditional and improved DSM are closely related to a normalized version of the Kirchhoff migration. The theoretical elements of our proposal are supported by various results from numerical simulations with synthetic and experimental data.;math.NA
1801.05996;$\varepsilon$-Approximability of Harmonic Functions in $L^p$ Implies Uniform Rectifiability;Suppose that $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, $n \ge 2$, is an open set satisfying the corkscrew condition with an $n$-dimensional ADR boundary, $\partial \Omega$. In this note, we show that if harmonic functions are $\varepsilon$-approximable in $L^p$ for any $p &gt, n/(n-1)$, then $\partial \Omega$ is uniformly rectifiable. Combining our results with those in [HT] (Hofmann-Tapiola) gives us a new characterization of uniform rectifiability which complements the recent results in [HMM] (Hofmann-Martell-Mayboroda), [GMT] (Garnett-Mourgoglou-Tolsa) and [AGMT] (Azzam-Garnett-Mourgoglou-Tolsa).;math.AP
1801.05998;A single server queue with batch arrivals and semi-Markov services;We investigate the transient and stationary queue-length distributions of a class of service systems with correlated service times. The classical $M^X/G/1$ queue with semi-Markov service times is the most prominent example in this class and serves as a vehicle to display our results. The sequence of service times is governed by a modulating process $J(t)$. The state of $J(\cdot)$ at a service initiation time determines the joint distribution of the subsequent service duration and the state of $J(\cdot)$ at the next service initiation. <br />Several earlier works have imposed technical conditions, on the zeros of a matrix determinant arising in the analysis, that are required in the computation of the stationary queue length probabilities. The imposed conditions in several of these articles are difficult or impossible to verify. Without such assumptions, we determine both the transient and the steady-state joint distribution of the number of customers immediately after a departure and the state of the process $J(t)$ at the start of the next service. <br />We numerically investigate how the mean queue length is affected by variability in the number of customers that arrive during a single service time. Our main observations here are that increasing variability may {\em reduce} the mean queue length, and that the Markovian dependence of service times can lead to large queue lengths, even if the system is not in heavy traffic.;math.PR
1801.05999;On the characterisations of wave front sets via the short-time Fourier transform;It is well known that the classical and Sobolev wave fronts were extended into non-equivalent global versions by the use of the short-time Fourier transform.

1801.06001;Generalized power central group identities in almost subnormal subgroups of $\GL_n(D)$;In this paper, we study almost subnormal subgroups of the general linear group $\GL_n(D)$ of degree $n\ge 1$ over a division ring $D$ that satisfy a generalized power central group identity.;math.RA
1801.06002;Short walk adventures;We review recent development of short uniform random walks, with a focus on its connection to (zeta) Mahler measures and modular parametrisation of the density functions. Furthermore, we extend available "probabilistic" techniques to cover a variation of random walks and reduce some three-variable Mahler measures, which are conjectured to evaluate in terms of $L$-values of modular forms, to hypergeometric form.;math.NT
1801.06004;Scattered classes of graphs;For a class $\mathcal C$ of graphs $G$ equipped with functions $f_G$ defined on subsets of $E(G)$ or $V(G)$, we say that $\mathcal{C}$ is $k$-scattered with respect to $f_G$ if there exists a constant $\ell$ such that for every graph $G\in \mathcal C$, the domain of $f_G$ can be partitioned into subsets of size at most $k$ so that the union of every collection of the subsets has $f_G$ value at most $\ell$. We present structural characterizations of graph classes that are $k$-scattered with respect to several graph connectivity functions. <br />In particular, our theorem for cut-rank functions provides a rough structural characterization of graphs having no $mK_{1,n}$ vertex-minor, which allows us to prove that such graphs have bounded linear rank-width.;math.CO
1801.06006;Bounds for higher topological complexity of real projective space implied by BP;We use Brown-Peterson cohomology to obtain lower bounds for the higher topological complexity, TC_k(RP^n), of real projective spaces, which are often much stronger than those implied by ordinary mod-2 cohomology.;math.AT

Some consequences are drawn, such as the degeneration of the Bloch-Lichtenbaum spectral sequence for any field containing $k$.;math.AG
1801.06013;Inverse of Infinite Hankel Moment Matrices;Let $(s_n)_{n\ge 0}$ denote an indeterminate Hamburger moment sequence and let $\mathcal H=\{s_{m+n}\}$ be the corresponding positive definite Hankel matrix. We consider the question if there exists an infinite symmetric matrix $\mathcal A=\{a_{j,k}\}$, which is an inverse of $\mathcal H$ in the sense that the matrix product $\mathcal A\mathcal H$ is defined by absolutely convergent series and $\mathcal A\mathcal H$ equals the identity matrix $\mathcal I$, a property called (aci). A candidate for $\mathcal A$ is the coefficient matrix of the reproducing kernel of the moment problem, considered as an entire function of two complex variables. We say that the moment problem has property (aci), if (aci) holds for this matrix $\mathcal A$. We show that this is true for many classical indeterminate moment problems but not for the symmetrized version of a cubic birth-and-death process studied by Valent and co-authors. We consider mainly symmetric indeterminate moment problems and give a number of sufficient conditions for (aci) to hold in terms of the recurrence coefficients for the orthonormal polynomials. A sufficient condition is a rapid increase of the recurrence coefficients in the sense that the quotient between consecutive terms is uniformly bounded by a constant strictly smaller than one. We also give a simple example, where (aci) holds, but an inverse matrix of $\mathcal H$ is highly non-unique.;math.CA
1801.06016;On improving the numerical convergence of highly nonlinear elasticity problems;Finite elasticity problems commonly include material and geometric nonlinearities and are solved using various numerical methods. However, for highly nonlinear problems, achieving convergence is relatively difficult and requires small load step sizes. In this work, we present a new method to transform the discretized governing equations so that the transformed problem has significantly reduced nonlinearity and, therefore, Newton solvers exhibit improved convergence properties. We study exponential-type nonlinearity in soft tissues and geometric nonlinearity in compression, and propose novel formulations for the two problems. We test the new formulations in several numerical examples and show significant reduction in iterations required for convergence, especially at large load steps. Notably, the proposed formulation is capable of yielding convergent solution even when 10 to 100 times larger load steps are applied. The proposed framework is generic and can be applied to other types of nonlinearities as well.;math.NA
1801.06021;Li-Yau inequality for unbounded Laplacian on graphs;In this paper, we derive Li-Yau inequality for unbounded Laplacian on complete weighted graphs with the assumption of the curvature-dimension inequality $CDE'(n,K)$, which can be regarded as a notion of curvature on graphs. Furthermore, we obtain some applications of Li-Yau inequality, including Harnack inequality, heat kernel bounds and Cheng's eigenvalue estimate. These are first kind of results on this direction for unbounded Laplacian on graphs.;math.DG
1801.06022;Reconstruction Codes for DNA Sequences with Uniform Tandem-Duplication Errors;DNA as a data storage medium has several advantages, including far greater data density compared to electronic media. We propose that schemes for data storage in the DNA of living organisms may benefit from studying the reconstruction problem, which is applicable whenever multiple reads of noisy data are available. This strategy is uniquely suited to the medium, which inherently replicates stored data in multiple distinct ways, caused by mutations. We consider noise introduced solely by uniform tandem-duplication, and utilize the relation to constant-weight integer codes in the Manhattan metric. By bounding the intersection of the cross-polytope with hyperplanes, we prove the existence of reconstruction codes with greater capacity than known error-correcting codes, which we can determine analytically for any set of parameters.;cs.IT
1801.06026;On power subgroups of Dehn twists in hyperelliptic mapping class groups;This paper contains two topics, the index of a power subgroup in the mapping class group $\mathcal{M}(0,2n)$ of a $2n$-punctured sphere and in the hyperelliptic mapping class group $\Delta(g,0)$ of an oriented closed surface of genus $g$. The main tool is a projective representation of $\mathcal{M}(0,2n)$ obtained through the Kauffman bracket skein module. For $\mathcal{M}(0,2n)$, we prove that the normal closure of the fifth power of a half-twist has infinite index. This is the remaining case of a Masbaum's work. For $\Delta(g,0)$, we consider the normal closure of $m$-th powers of Dehn twists along all symmetric simple closed curves. We show the subgroup has infinite index if $m\geq 5$ and $m\neq 6$ for any $g\geq 2$.;math.GT
1801.06034;Boolean degree 1 functions on some classical association schemes;We investigate Boolean degree 1 functions for several classical association schemes, including Johnson graphs, Grassmann graphs, graphs from polar spaces, and bilinear forms graphs, as well as some other domains such as multislices (Young subgroups of the symmetric group). In some settings, Boolean degree 1 functions are also known as \textit{completely regular strength 0 codes of covering radius 1}, \textit{Cameron--Liebler line classes}, and \textit{tight sets}. <br />We classify all Boolean degree $1$ functions on the multislice. On the Grassmann scheme $J_q(n, k)$ we show that all Boolean degree $1$ functions are trivial for $n \geq 5$, $k, n-k \geq 2$ and $q \in \{ 2, 3, 4, 5 \}$, and that for general $q$, the problem can be reduced to classifying all Boolean degree $1$ functions on $J_q(n, 2)$. We also consider polar spaces and the bilinear forms graphs, giving evidence that all Boolean degree $1$ functions are trivial for appropriate choices of the parameters.;math.CO
1801.06035;The motivic Mahowald invariant;The classical Mahowald invariant is a method for producing nonzero classes in the stable homotopy groups of spheres from classes in lower stems. We study the Mahowald invariant in the setting of motivic stable homotopy theory over $Spec(\mathbb{C})$. We compute a motivic version of the $C_2$-Tate construction for various motivic spectra, and show that this construction produces "blueshift" in these cases. We use these computations to show that the Mahowald invariant of $\eta^i$, $i \geq 1$, is the first element in Adams filtration $i$ of the $w_1$-periodic families constructed by Andrews ~\cite{And14}. This provides an exotic periodic analog of Mahowald and Ravenel's computation ~\cite{MR93} that the classical Mahowald invariant of $2^i$, $i \geq 1$, is the first element in Adams filtration $i$ of the $v_1$-periodic families constructed by Adams ~\cite{Ada66}.;math.AT
1801.06040;The Higson-Roe sequence for &#xe9,tale groupoids. I. Dual algebras and compatibility with the BC map;We introduce the dual Roe algebras for proper \'{e}tale groupoid actions and deduce the expected Higson-Roe short exact sequence. When the action is cocompact, we show that the Roe $C^*$-ideal of locally compact operators is Morita equivalent to the reduced $C^*$-algebra of our groupoid, and we further identify the boundary map of the associated periodic six-term exact sequence with the Baum-Connes map, via a Paschke-Higson map for groupoids. For proper actions on continuous families of manifolds of bounded geometry, we associate with any $G$-equivariant Dirac-type family, a coarse index class which generalizes the Paterson index class and also the Moore-Schochet Connes' index class for laminations.;math.KT
1801.06045;Ordered group-valued probability, positive operators, and integral representations;Probability maps are additive and normalised maps taking values in the unit interval of a lattice ordered Abelian group. They appear in theory of affine representations and they are also a semantic counterpart of Hajek's probability logic. In this paper we obtain a correspondence between probability maps and positive operators between certain Riesz spaces, which extends the well-known representation theorem of real-valued MV-algebraic states by positive linear functionals. When the codomain algebra contains all continuous functions, the set of all probability maps is convex, and we prove that its extreme points coincide with homomorphisms. We also show that probability maps can be viewed as a collection of states indexed by maximal ideals of a codomain algebra and we characterise this collection in special cases.;math.FA
1801.06056;The user&#x27,s guide project: giving experiential context to research papers;This paper was written in 2015, and published in the Journal of Humanistic Mathematics.

1801.06058;Output Feedback Control Based on State and Disturbance Estimation;Recently developed control methods with strong disturbance rejection capabilities provide a useful option for control design. The key lies in a general concept of disturbance and effective ways to estimate and compensate the disturbance. This work extends the concept of disturbance as the mismatch between a system model and the true dynamics, and estimates and compensates the disturbance for multi-input multi-output linear/nonlinear systems described in a general form. The results presented do not need to assume the disturbance to be independent of the control inputs or satisfy a certain matching condition, and do not require the system to be expressible in an integral canonical form as required by algorithms previously described in literature. The estimator and controller are designed under a state tracking framework, and sufficient conditions for the closed-loop stability are presented. The performance of the resulting controller relies on a co-design of the system model, the state and disturbance observer, and the controller. Numerical experiments on a first-order system and an inverted pendulum under uncertainties are used to illustrate the control design method and demonstrate its efficacy.;math.OC
1801.06060;Flat ideals in the unit interval with the canonical fuzzy order;A characterization of flat ideals in the unit interval with the canonical fuzzy order is obtained with the help of the ordinal sum decomposition of continuous t-norms. This characterization will be useful in the study of topological and domain theoretic properties of fuzzy orders.;math.GM
1801.06064;Boundedness and compactness of commutators associated with Lipschitz functions;Let $\alpha\in (0, 1]$, $\beta\in [0, n)$ and $T_{\Omega,\beta}$ be a singular or fractional integral operator with homogeneous kernel $\Omega$. In this article, a CMO type space ${\rm CMO}_\alpha(\mathbb R^n)$ is introduced and studied. In particular, the relationship between ${\rm CMO}_\alpha(\mathbb R^n)$ and the Lipchitz space $Lip_\alpha(\mathbb R^n)$ is discussed. Moreover, a necessary condition of restricted boundedness of the iterated commutator $(T_{\Omega,\beta})^m_b$ on weighted Lebesgue spaces via functions in $Lip_\alpha(\mathbb R^n)$, and an equivalent characterization of the compactness for $(T_{\Omega,\beta})^m_b$ via functions in ${\rm CMO}_\alpha(\mathbb R^n)$ are obtained. Some results are new even in the unweighted setting for the first order commutators.;math.CA
1801.06065;Wildly Compatible Systems and Six Operations;For a scheme $X$ separated and of finite type over an excellent regular scheme $S$, we define wildly compatible systems of constructible sheaves of modules over finite fields on $X$ for certain vector spaces $V$. The main result is that for $\dim S \leq 1$, wildly compatible systems are preserved by Grothendieck's six operations and Verdier's duality. Finally, for a smooth integral scheme $X$ over a finite field, we prove that all $\ell$-adic compatible systems gives wildly compatible systems.;math.AG
1801.06071;Quiver varieties and symmetric pairs;We study fixed-point loci of Nakajima varieties under symplectomorphisms and their anti-symplectic cousins, which are compositions of a diagram automorphism, a reflection functor and a transpose defined by certain bilinear forms. These subvarieties provide a natural home for geometric representation theory of symmetric pairs. In particular, the cohomology of a Steinberg-type variety of the symplectic fixed-point subvarieties is conjecturally related to the universal enveloping algebra of the subalgebra in a symmetric pair. The latter symplectic subvarieties are further used to construct geometrically an action of a twisted Yangian on torus equivariant cohomology of Nakajima varieties. In type $A$ case, these subvarieties provide a quiver model for partial Springer resolutions of nilpotent Slodowy slices of classical groups and associated symmetric spaces, which leads to a rectangular symmetry and a refinement of Kraft-Procesi row/column removal reductions.;math.RT
1801.06072;On a conjecture about Morita algebras;We give an example of a Morita algebra $A$ with a tilting module $T$ such that the algebra $End_A(T)$ has dominant dimension at least two but is not a Morita algebra. This provides a counterexample to a conjecture by Chen and Xi from \cite{CX}.;math.RT
1801.06076;Commutativity in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Mechanics;The main result of this note is a characterization of the Poisson commutativity of Hamilton functions in terms of their principal action functions.;math-ph
1801.06078;Noncrossing partitions, Bruhat order and the cluster complex;We introduce two order relations on finite Coxeter groups which refine the absolute and the Bruhat order, and establish some of their main properties. In particular we study the restriction of these orders to noncrossing partitions and show that the intervals for these orders can be enumerated in terms of the cluster complex. The properties of our orders permit to revisit several results in Coxeter combinatorics, such as the Chapoton triangles and how they are related, the enumeration of reflections with full support, the bijections between clusters and noncrossing partitions.;math.CO
1801.06083;The $q$-Onsager Algebra and the Universal Askey-Wilson Algebra;Recently Pascal Baseilhac and Stefan Kolb obtained a PBW basis for the $q$-Onsager algebra $\mathcal O_q$. They defined the PBW basis elements recursively, and it is obscure how to express them in closed form. To mitigate the difficulty, we bring in the universal Askey-Wilson algebra $\Delta_q$. There is a natural algebra homomorphism $\natural \colon \mathcal O_q \to \Delta_q$. We apply $\natural $ to the above PBW basis, and express the images in closed form. Our results make heavy use of the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind.;math.QA
1801.06088;On the vanishing contact structure for viscosity solutions of contact type Hamilton-Jacobi equations I: Cauchy problem;We study the representation formulae for the fundamental solutions and viscosity solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equations of contact type. We also obtain a vanishing contact structure result for relevant Cauchy problems which can be regarded as an extension to the vanishing discount problem.;math.AP
1801.06089;Level Reciprocity in the twisted second moment of Rankin-Selberg L-functions;We prove an exact formula for the second moment of Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions $L(1/2,f \times g)$ twisted by $\lambda_f(p)$, where $g$ is a fixed holomorphic cusp form and $f$ is summed over automorphic forms of a given level $q$. The formula is a reciprocity relation that exchanges the twist parameter $p$ and the level $q$. The method involves the Bruggeman/Kuznetsov trace formula on both ends, finally the reciprocity relation is established by an identity of sums of Kloosterman sums.;math.NT
1801.06095;A Gauss-Jacobi Kernel Compression Scheme for Fractional Differential Equations;A scheme for approximating the kernel $w$ of the fractional $\alpha$-integral by a linear combination of exponentials is proposed and studied. The scheme is based on the application of a composite Gauss-Jacobi quadrature rule to an integral representation of $w$. This results in an approximation of $w$ in an interval $[\delta,T]$, with $0&lt,\delta$, which converges rapidly in the number $J$ of quadrature nodes associated with each interval of the composite rule. Using error analysis for Gauss-Jacobi quadratures for analytic functions, an estimate of the relative pointwise error is obtained. The estimate shows that the number of terms required for the approximation to satisfy a prescribed error tolerance is bounded for all $\alpha\in(0,1)$, and that $J$ is bounded for $\alpha\in(0,1)$, $T&gt,0$, and $\delta\in(0,T)$.;math.NA
1801.06103;Cut Finite Elements for Convection in Fractured Domains;We develop a cut finite element method (CutFEM) for the convection problem in a so called fractured domain which is a union of manifolds of different dimensions such that a $d$ dimensional component always resides on the boundary of a $d+1$ dimensional component. This type of domain can for instance be used to model porous media with embedded fractures that may intersect. The convection problem can be formulated in a compact form suitable for analysis using natural abstract directional derivative and divergence operators. The cut finite element method is based on using a fixed background mesh that covers the domain and the manifolds are allowed to cut through a fixed background mesh in an arbitrary way. We consider a simple method based on continuous piecewise linear elements together with weak enforcement of the coupling conditions and stabilization. We prove a priori error estimates and present illustrating numerical examples.;math.NA
1801.06110;Least primitive root and simultaneous power-non residues;Let $p$ be a prime and let $g(p)$ be the least primitive root modulo $p$. We prove that for any $\epsilon&gt,0$ and $p$ large enough the bound \begin{align} g(p)\ll p^{\frac{1}{4\sqrt{e}}+\epsilon} \nonumber <br />\end{align} holds for most prime $p$ such that $p-1$ does not have small prime factors, but $2$. We also give an explicit description of the exceptional set.;math.NT
1801.06112;Ideals modulo a prime;The main focus of this paper is on the problem of relating an ideal $I$ in the polynomial ring $\mathbb Q[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ to a corresponding ideal in $\mathbb F_p[x_1,\dots, x_n]$ where $p$ is a prime number, in other words, the \textit{reduction modulo $p$} of $I$. We first define a new notion of $\sigma$-good prime for $I$ which does depends on the term ordering $\sigma$, but not on the given generators of $I$. We relate our notion of $\sigma$-good primes to some other similar notions already in the literature. <br />Then we introduce and describe a new invariant called the universal denominator which frees our definition of reduction modulo~$p$ from the term ordering, thus letting us show that all but finitely many primes are good for $I$. <br />One characteristic of our approach is that it enables us to easily detect some bad primes, a distinct advantage when using modular methods.;math.AC
1801.06125;Classifying braidings on fusion categories;We show that braidings on a fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ correspond to certain fusion subcategories of the center of $\mathcal{C}$ transversal to the canonical Lagrangian algebra. This allows to classify braidings on non-degenerate and group-theoretical fusion categories.;math.QA
1801.06127;Reduced order models for fluid-structure interaction problems with applications in haemodynamics;This paper deals with fast simulations of the haemodynamics in large arteries by considering a reduced model of the associated fluid-structure interaction problem, which in turn allows an additional reduction in terms of the numerical discretisation. The resulting method is both accurate and computationally cheap. This goal is achieved by means of two levels of reduction: first, we describe the model equations with a reduced mathematical formulation which allows to write the fluid-structure interaction problem as a Navier-Stokes system with non-standard boundary conditions, second, we employ numerical reduction techniques to further and drastically lower the computational costs. The numerical reduction is obtained coupling two well-known techniques: the proper orthogonal decomposition and the reduced basis method, in particular the greedy algorithm. We start by reducing the numerical dimension of the problem at hand with a proper orthogonal decomposition and we measure the system energy with specific norms, this allows to take into account the different orders of magnitude of the state variables, the velocity and the pressure. Then, we introduce a strategy based on a greedy procedure which aims at enriching the reduced discretization space with low offline computational costs. As application, we consider a realistic haemodynamics problem with a perturbation in the boundary conditions and we show the good performances of the reduction techniques presented in the paper. The gains obtained in term of CPU time are of three orders of magnitude.;math.NA
1801.06130;Genus zero Gopakumar-Vafa type invariants for Calabi-Yau 4-folds II: Fano 3-folds;In analogy with the Gopakumar-Vafa (GV) conjecture on Calabi-Yau (CY) 3-folds, Klemm and Pandharipande defined GV type invariants on Calabi-Yau 4-folds using Gromov-Witten theory and conjectured their integrality. In a joint work with Maulik and Toda, the author conjectured their genus zero invariants are $\mathrm{DT_4}$ invariants of one dimensional stable sheaves. In this paper, we study this conjecture on the total space of canonical bundle of a Fano 3-fold $Y$, which reduces to a relation between twisted GW and $\mathrm{DT_3}$ invariants on $Y$. Examples are computed for both compact and non-compact Fano 3-folds to support our conjecture.;math.AG
1801.06143;TASEP fluctuations with soft-shock initial data;We consider the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with \emph{soft-shock} initial particle density, which is a step function increasing in the direction of flow and the step size chosen small to admit KPZ scaling. The initial configuration is deterministic and the dynamics create a shock. <br />We prove that the fluctuations of a particle at the macroscopic position of the shock converge to the maximum of two independent GOE Tracy-Widom random variables, which establishes a conjecture of Ferrari and Nejjar. Furthermore, we show the joint fluctuations of particles near the shock are determined by the maximum of two lines described in terms of these two random variables. The microscopic position of the shock is then seen to be their difference. <br />Our proofs rely on determinantal formulae and a novel factorization of the associated kernels.;math.PR
1801.06148;Characterization of probability distribution convergence in Wasserstein distance by $L^{p}$-quantization error function;We establish conditions to characterize probability measures by their $L^{p}$-quantization error functions in both $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and Hilbert settings. This characterization is two-fold: static (identity of two distributions) and dynamic (convergence for the $L^p$-Wasserstein distance). We first propose a criterion on the quantization level $N$, valid for any norm on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and any order $p$ based on a geometrical approach involving the Vorono\"i diagram. Then, we prove that in the $L^2$-case on a (separable) Hilbert space, the condition on the level $N$ can be reduced to $N=2$, which is optimal. More quantization based characterization cases on dimension 1 and a discussion of the completeness of a distance defined by the quantization error function can be found in the end of this paper.;math.PR
1801.06151;An estimation of level sets for non local KPP equations with delay;We study the large time asymptotic behavior of the solutions of the linear parabolic equation with delay $(*)$: $u_{t}(t,x) = u_{xx}(t,x) - u(t,x) + \int_{\mathbb{R}} k(x-y) \, u (t-h, y)\, dy$, $x \in \R$, $\ t &gt,0$, and $k(x) \in L^1(\R)$. As an application we get estimates on the measure of level sets of non local KPP type equations with delay. For this type of nonlinear equations we prove that, in contrast with the classical case, the solution to the initial value problem with data of compact support may not be persistent.;math.AP
1801.06156;The Rayleigh-Taylor instability for the Verigin problem with and without phase transition;Isothermal compressible two-phase flows in a capillary are modeled with and without phase transition in the presence of gravity, employing Darcy's law for the velocity field. It is shown that the resulting systems are thermodynamically consistent in the sense that the available energy is a strict Lyapunov functional. In both cases, the equilibria with flat interface are identified. It is shown that the problems are well-posed in an $L_p$-setting and generate local semiflows in the proper state manifolds. The main result concerns the stability of equilibria with flat interface, i.e. the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.;math.AP
1801.06162;Endomorphisms of nilpotent groups of finite rank;We obtain sufficient criteria for endomorphisms of torsion-free nilpotent groups of finite rank to be automorphisms, by considering the induced maps on the torsion-free abelianisation and the centre. Whilst these results are known in the finitely generated case removing this assumption introduces several difficulties.;math.GR
1801.06169;The number of $4$-cycles and the cyclomatic number of a finite simple graph;Let $G$ be a finite connected simple graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. We show that the number of $4$-cycles contained in $G$ is at most $\binom{m-n+1}{2}$ when $G$ is not bipartite. We further provide a short combinatorial proof of the bound $\binom{m-n+2}{2}$ which holds for bipartite graphs.;math.CO
1801.06171;Private Information Retrieval Through Wiretap Channel II: Privacy Meets Security;We consider the problem of private information retrieval through wiretap channel II (PIR-WTC-II). In PIR-WTC-II, a user wants to retrieve a single message (file) privately out of $M$ messages, which are stored in $N$ replicated and non-communicating databases. An external eavesdropper observes a fraction $\mu_n$ (of its choice) of the traffic exchanged between the $n$th database and the user. In addition to the privacy constraint, the databases should encode the returned answer strings such that the eavesdropper learns absolutely nothing about the \emph{contents} of the databases. We aim at characterizing the capacity of the PIR-WTC-II under the combined privacy and security constraints. We obtain a general upper bound for the problem in the form of a max-min optimization problem, which extends the converse proof of the PIR problem under asymmetric traffic constraints. We propose an achievability scheme that satisfies the security constraint by encoding a secret key, which is generated securely at each database, into an artificial noise vector using an MDS code. The user and the databases operate at one of the corner points of the achievable scheme for the PIR under asymmetric traffic constraints such that the retrieval rate is maximized under the imposed security constraint. The upper bound and the lower bound match for the case of $M=2$ and $M=3$ messages, for any $N$, and any $\boldsymbol{\mu}=(\mu_1, \cdots, \mu_N)$.;cs.IT
1801.06182;Where do odd perfect numbers live?;The existence of a perfect odd number is an old open problem of number theory. An Euler's theorem states that if an odd integer $ n $ is perfect, then $ n $ is written as $ n = p ^ rm ^ 2 $, where $ r, m $ are odd numbers, $ p $ is a prime number of the form $ 4 k + 1 $ and $ (p, m) = 1 $, where $ (x, y) $ denotes the greatest common divisor of $ x $ and $ y $. In this article we show that the exponent $ r $, of $ p $, in this equation, is necessarily equal to 1. That is, if $ n $ is an odd perfect number, then $ n $ is written as $ n = pm ^ 2. $;math.NT
1801.06197;Entrance laws for annihilating Brownian motions and the continuous-space voter model;Consider a system of particles moving independently as Brownian motions until two of them meet, when the colliding pair annihilates instantly. The construction of such a system of annihilating Brownian motions (aBMs) is straightforward as long as we start with a finite number of particles, but is more involved for infinitely many particles. In particular, if we let the set of starting points become increasingly dense in the real line it is not obvious whether the resulting systems of aBMs converge and what the possible limit points (entrance laws) are. In this paper, we show that aBMs arise as the interface model of the continuous-space voter model. This link allows us to provide a full classification of entrance laws for aBMs. We also give some examples showing how different entrance laws can be obtained via finite approximations. Further, we discuss the relation of the continuous-space voter model to the stepping stone and other related models. Finally, we obtain an expression for the $n$-point densities of aBMs starting from an arbitrary entrance law.;math.PR
1801.06198;A unified way of analyzing some greedy algorithms;In this paper we propose a unified way of analyzing a certain kind of greedy-type algorithms in Banach spaces. We define a class of the Weak Biorthogonal Greedy Algorithms that contains a wide range of greedy algorithms. In particular, we show that the following well-known algorithms --- the Weak Chebyshev Greedy Algorithm and the Weak Greedy Algorithm with Free Relaxation --- belong to this class. We investigate the properties of convergence, rate of convergence, and numerical stability of the Weak Biorthogonal Greedy Algorithms. Numerical stability is understood in the sense that the steps of the algorithm are allowed to be performed with controlled computational inaccuracies. We carry out a thorough analysis of the connection between the magnitude of those inaccuracies and the convergence properties of the algorithm. To emphasize the advantage of the proposed approach, we introduce here a new greedy algorithm --- the Rescaled Weak Relaxed Greedy Algorithm --- from the above class, and derive the convergence results without analyzing the algorithm explicitly. Additionally, we explain how the proposed approach can be extended to some other types of greedy algorithms.;math.NA
1801.06199;Clark representation for self-intersection local times of Gaussian integrators;In present article we prove the existence of multiple self-intersection local times, describe its Ito-Wiener expansion and establish Clark representation for the class of Gaussian integrators generated by operators with a finite dimensional kernel.;math.PR
1801.06200;The saga of a fish: from a survival guide to closing lemmas;In the paper by D.~Burago, S.~Ivanov and A.~Novikov, "A survival guide for feeble fish", it has been shown that a fish with limited velocity can reach any point in the (possibly unbounded) ocean provided that the fluid velocity field is incompressible, bounded and has vanishing mean drift. This result extends some known global controllability theorems though being substantially nonconstructive. We give a fish a different recipe of how to survive in a turbulent ocean, and show its relationship to structural stability of dynamical systems by providing a constructive way to change slightly the velocity field to produce conservative (in the sense of not having wandering sets of positive measure) dynamics. In particular, this leads to the extension of C.~Pugh's closing lemma to incompressible vector fields over unbounded domains. The results are based on an extension of the Poincar\'{e} recurrence theorem to some $\sigma$-finite measures and on specially constructed Newtonian potentials.;math.DS
1801.06201;A categorification of a cyclotomic Hecke algebra;We propose a categorification of the cyclotomic Hecke algebra in terms of the equivariant K-theory of the framed matrix factorizations. The construction generalizes the earlier construction of the authors for a categorification of the finite Hecke algebra of type A. <br />We also explain why our construction provides a faithful realization of the Hecke algebras and discuss a geometric realization of the Jucys-Murphy subalgebra.;math.RT
1801.06205;Finite-dimensional Hopf algebras over the smallest non-pointed basic Hopf algebra;We classify finite-dimensional Hopf algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero whose Hopf coradcial is isomorphic to the smallest non-pointed basic Hopf algebra, under the assumption that the diagrams are strictly graded. In particular, we obtain some new Nichols algebras of non-diagonal type and new finite-dimensional Hopf algebras without the dual Chevalley property.;math.QA
1801.06206;The subseries number;Every conditionally convergent series of real numbers has a divergent subseries. How many subsets of the natural numbers are needed so that every conditionally convergent series diverges on the subseries corresponding to one of these sets? The answer to this question is defined to be the subseries number, a new cardinal characteristic of the continuum. This cardinal is bounded below by $\aleph_1$ and above by the cardinality of the continuum, but it is not provably equal to either. We define three natural variants of the subseries number, and compare them with each other, with their corresponding rearrangement numbers, and with several well-studied cardinal characteristics of the continuum. Many consistency results are obtained from these comparisons, and we obtain another by computing the value of the subseries number in the Laver model.;math.LO
1801.06209;Phase measurement of quantum walks: application to structure theorem of the positive support of the Grover walk;We obtain a structure theorem of the positive support of the $n$-th power of the Grover walk on $k$-regular graph whose girth is greater than $2(n-1)$. This structure theorem is provided by the parity of the amplitude of another quantum walk on the line which depends only on $k$. The phase pattern of this quantum walk has a curious regularity. We also exactly show how the spectrum of the $n$-th power of the Grover walk is obtained by lifting up that of the adjacency matrix to the complex plain.;math-ph
1801.06210;On the topology of moduli spaces of real algebraic curves;We show that mapping class groups associated to all types of real algebraic curves are virtual duality groups. We also deduce some results about the orbifold homotopy groups of the moduli spaces of real algebraic curves. We achieve these results by defining a new complex associated to a not necessarily orientable surface with boundary called the $\mathcal{A}\mathcal{B}\mathcal{C}$-complex. This complex encodes the intersection patterns of isotopy classes of essential simple arcs, boundary components, and essential simple closed curves. We show that this complex is homotopy equivalent to an infinite wedge of spheres, its dimension is dependent on the topological type of the surface.;math.GT
1801.06212;On maps preserving connectedness and /or compactness;We call a function $f: X\to Y$ $P$-preserving if, for every subspace $A \subset X$ with property $P$, its image $f(A)$ also has property $P$. Of course, all continuous maps are both compactness- and connectedness-preserving and the natural question about when the converse of this holds, i.e. under what conditions is such a map continuous, has a long history. <br />Our main result is that any non-trivial product function, i.e. one having at least two non-constant factors, that has connected domain, $T_1$ range, and is connectedness-preserving must actually be continuous. The analogous statement badly fails if we replace in it the occurrences of "connected" by "compact". We also present, however, several interesting results and examples concerning maps that are compactness-preserving and/or continuum-preserving.;math.GN
1801.06213;The parametrix problem for Toda equation with steplike initial data;This paper is a continuation of arXiv:17.01.02867. We give here rigorous solution of the parametrix problem for Toda rarefaction problem and complete asymptotic analysis, justifying the asymptotics obtained in arXiv:17.01.02867.;math-ph
1801.06214;An effective criterion for periodicity of l-adic continued fractions;The theory of continued fractions has been generalized to l-adic numbers by several authors and presents many differences with respect to the real case. In the present paper we investigate the expansion of rationals and quadratic irrationals for the l-adic continued fractions introduced by Ruban. In this case, rational numbers may have a periodic non-terminating continued fraction expansion, moreover, for quadratic irrational numbers, no analogue of Lagrange's theorem holds. We give general explicit criteria to establish the periodicity of the expansion in both the rational and the quadratic case (for rationals, the qualitative result is due to Laohakosol).;math.NT
1801.06221;The One-Phase Bifurcation For The p-Laplacian;A bifurcation about the uniqueness of a solution of a singularly perturbed free boundary problem of phase transition associated with the p-Laplacian, subject to given boundary condition is proved in this paper. We show this phenomenon by proving the existence of a third solution through the Mountain Pass Lemma when the boundary data decreases below a threshold. In the second part, we prove the convergence of an evolution to stable solutions, and show the Mountain Pass solution is unstable in this sense.;math.AP
1801.06225;Conservation Laws with Coinciding Smooth Solutions but Different Conserved Variable;Consider two hyperbolic systems of conservation laws in one space dimension with the same eigenvalues and (right) eigenvectors. We prove that solutions to Cauchy problems with the same initial data differ at third order in the total variation of the initial datum. As a first application, relying on the classical Glimm-Lax result, we obtain estimates improving those in by Saint Raymond on the distance between solutions to the isentropic and non-isentropic inviscid compressible Euler equations, under general equations of state. Further applications are to the general scalar case, where rather precise estimates are obtained, to an approximation by Di Perna of the p-system and to a traffic model.;math.AP
1801.06227;Controlling IL-7 injections in HIV-infected patients;Immune interventions consisting in repeated injection are broadly used as they are thought to improve the quantity and the quality of the immune response. However, they also raised several questions that remains unanswered, in particular the number of injections to make or the delay to respect between different injections to acheive this goal. Practical and financial considerations add constraints to these questions, especially in the framework of human studies. We specifically focus here on the use of interleukine-7 (IL-7) injections in HIV-infected patients under antiretroviral treatment, but still unable to restore normal levels of CD4+ T lymphocytes. Clinical trials have already shown that repeated cycles of injections of IL-7 could help maintaining CD4+ T lymphocytes levels over the limit of 500 cells per microL, by affecting proliferation and survival of CD4+ T cells. We then aim at answering the question : how to maintain a patient's level of CD4+ T lymphocytes by using a minimum number of injections (ie optimizing the strategy of injections) ? Based on mechanistic models that were previously developed for the dynamics of CD4+ T lymphocytes in this context, we model the process by a piecewise deterministic Markov model. We then address the question by using some recently established theory on impulse control problem in order to develop a numerical tool determining the optimal strategy. Results are obtained on a reduced model, as a proof of concept : the method allows to defined an optimal strategy for a given patient. This method could applied to optimize injections schedules in clinical trials.;math.OC
1801.06235;Vector-Valued Banach Limits and Vector-Valued Almost Convergence;This book pretends to compile the latest advances on vector-valued Banach limits as well as their applications to vector-valued almost convergence.;math.FA
1801.06240;Robust Recovery of Low-Rank Matrices with Non-Orthogonal Sparse Decomposition from Incomplete Measurements;We consider the problem of recovering an unknown effectively $(s_1,s_2)$-sparse low-rank-$R$ matrix $X$ with possibly non-orthogonal rank-$1$ decomposition from incomplete and inaccurate linear measurements of the form $y = \mathcal A (X) + \eta$, where $\eta$ is an ineliminable noise. We first derive an optimization formulation for matrix recovery under the considered model and propose a novel algorithm, called Alternating Tikhonov regularization and Lasso (A-T-LA$\text{S}_{2,1}$), to solve it. The algorithm is based on a multi-penalty regularization, which is able to leverage both structures (low-rankness and sparsity) simultaneously. The algorithm is a fast first order method, and straightforward to implement. We prove global convergence for any linear measurement model to stationary points and local convergence to global minimizers. By adapting the concept of restricted isometry property from compressed sensing to our novel model class, we prove error bounds between global minimizers and ground truth, up to noise level, from a number of subgaussian measurements scaling as $R(s_1+s_2)$, up to log-factors in the dimension, and relative-to-diameter distortion. Simulation results demonstrate both the accuracy and efficacy of the algorithm, as well as its superiority to the state-of-the-art algorithms in strong noise regimes and for matrices, whose singular vectors do not possess exact (joint-) sparse support.;math.NA
1801.06244;Short proof of Rademacher&#x27,s formula for partitions;This note rederives a formula for $r$-color partitions, $1 \le r \le 24$, including Rademacher's celebrated result for ordinary partitions, from the duality between modular forms of weights $-r/2$ and $2+r/2$.;math.NT
1801.06245;A method for construction of rational points over elliptic curves II: Points over solvable extensions;I provide a systematic construction of points, defined over finite radical extensions, on any Legendre curve over any field of characteristic not equal two. This includes as special case Douglas Ulmer's construction of rational points over a rational function field in characteristic $p&gt,0$. In particular I show that if $n\geq 4$ is any even integer and not divisible by the characteristic of the field then any elliptic curve $E$ over this field has at least $2n$ rational points over a finite solvable field extension. Under additional hypothesis, when the ground field is a number field, I show that these are of infinite order. I also show that Ulmer's points lift to characteristic zero and in particular to the canonical lifting.;math.AG
1801.06250;Computing heights on weighted projective spaces;In this note we extend the concept height on projective spaces to that of weighted height on weighted projective spaces and show how such a height can be computed. We prove some of the basic properties of the weighted height and show how it can be used to study hyperelliptic curves over Q. Some examples are provided from the weighted moduli space of binary sextics and octavics.;math.AG
1801.06251;Atomic and Littlewood-Paley Characterizations of Anisotropic Mixed-Norm Hardy Spaces and Their Applications;Let $\vec{a}:=(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\in[1,\infty)^n$, $\vec{p}:=(p_1,\ldots,p_n)\in(0,\infty)^n$ and $H_{\vec{a}}^{\vec{p}}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ be the anisotropic mixed-norm Hardy space associated with $\vec{a}$ defined via the non-tangential grand maximal function. In this article, via first establishing a Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund decomposition and a discrete Calder\'{o}n reproducing formula, the authors then characterize $H_{\vec{a}}^{\vec{p}}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, respectively, by means of atoms, the Lusin area function, the Littlewood-Paley $g$-function or $g_{\lambda}^\ast$-function. The obtained Littlewood-Paley $g$-function characterization of $H_{\vec{a}}^{\vec{p}}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ coincidentally confirms a conjecture proposed by Hart et al. [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. (2017), DOI: 10.1090/tran/7312]. Applying the aforementioned Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund decomposition as well as the atomic characterization of $H_{\vec{a}}^{\vec{p}}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, the authors establish a finite atomic characterization of $H_{\vec{a}}^{\vec{p}}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, which further induces a criterion on the boundedness of sublinear operators from $H_{\vec{a}}^{\vec{p}}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ into a quasi-Banach space. Then, applying this criterion, the authors obtain the boundedness of anisotropic Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators from $H_{\vec{a}}^{\vec{p}}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ to itself [or to $L^{\vec{p}}(\mathbb{R}^n)$]. The obtained atomic characterizations of $H_{\vec{a}}^{\vec{p}}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and boundedness of anisotropic Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators on these Hardy-type spaces positively answer two questions mentioned by Cleanthous et al. in [J. Geom. Anal. 27 (2017), 2758-2787]. All these results are new even for the isotropic mixed-norm Hardy spaces on $\mathbb{R}^n$.;math.CA
1801.06255;On the Contractivity of Privacy Mechanisms;We present a novel way to compare the statistical cost of privacy mechanisms using their Dobrushin coefficient. Specifically, we provide upper and lower bounds for the Dobrushin coefficient of a privacy mechanism in terms of its maximal leakage and local differential privacy guarantees. Given the geometric nature of the Dobrushin coefficient, this approach provides some insights into the general statistical cost of these privacy guarantees. We highlight the strength of this method by applying our results to develop new bounds on the $\ell_2$-minimax risk in a distribution estimation setting under maximal leakage constraints. Specifically, we find its order with respect to the sample size and privacy level, allowing a quantitative comparison with the corresponding local differential privacy $\ell_2$-minimax risk.;cs.IT
1801.06269;On the direct product of partial Burnside rings;In this paper, we describe the structure of the direct product of partial Burnside rings of relative to the collection of a finite group. In particular, we show that the unit group of the partial Burnside ring relative to the set of all parabolic subgroups of a reducible finite Coxeter group is isomorphic to the direct product of unit groups of the partial Burnside ring of irreducible Coxeter group.;math.GR

With the rigorous analysis of the potentials and the constants of motion, we are able to give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of bounded and periodic orbits. We also show and analyze numerical solutions of Newton equations of motion.;math-ph
1801.06280;A direct imaging method for inverse scattering by unbounded rough surfaces;This paper is concerned with the inverse scattering problem by an unbounded rough surface. A direct imaging method is proposed to reconstruct the rough surface from the scattered near-field Cauchy data generating by point sources and measured on a horizontal straight line segment at a finite distance above the rough surface. Theoretical analysis of the imaging algorithm is given for the case of a penetrable rough surface, but the imaging algorithm also works for impenetrable surfaces with Dirichlet or impedance boundary conditions. Numerical experiments are presented to show that the direct imaging algorithm is fast, accurate and very robust with respect to noise in the data.;math.NA
1801.06281;Remarks on BCOV invariants and degenerations of Calabi-Yau manifolds;For a one parameter family of Calabi-Yau threefolds, Green, Griffiths and Kerr have expressed the total singularities in terms of the degrees of Hodge bundles and Euler number of the general fiber. In this paper, we show that the total singularities can be expressed by the sum of asymptotic values of BCOV invariants, studied by Fang, Lu and Yoshikawa. On the other hand, by using Yau's Schwarz lemma, we prove Arakelov type inequalities and Euler number bound for Calabi-Yau family over a compact Riemann surface.;math.DG

1801.06298;Stability analysis of the two-phase torsional rigidity near a radial configuration;Let $\Omega_0$ denote the unit ball of $\mathbb{R}^N$ ($N\ge 2$) centered at the origin. We suppose that $\Omega_0$ contains a core, given by a smaller concentric ball $D_0$, made of a (possibly) different material. We discover that, depending on the relative hardness of the two materials, this radial configuration can either be a local maximizer for the torsional rigidity functional $E$ or a saddle shape. In this paper we consider perturbations that simultaneously act on the boundaries $\partial D_0$ and $\partial\Omega_0$. This gives rise to resonance effects that are not present when $\partial D_0$ or $\partial\Omega_0$ are perturbed in isolation. A detailed analysis of the sign of the second order shape derivative of $E$ is then made possible by employing the use of spherical harmonics.;math.AP
1801.06301;A topological interpretation of Viro&#x27,s $\mathfrak{gl}(1\vert 1)$-Alexander polynomial of a graph;This is a sequel to [<a href="/abs/1708.09092">arXiv:1708.09092v2</a>]. For an oriented trivalent graph $G$ without source or sink embedded in $S^3$, we prove that the $\mathfrak{gl}(1| 1)$-Alexander polynomial $\underline{\Delta}(G, c)$ defined by Viro satisfies a series of relations, which we call MOY-type relations in [<a href="/abs/1708.09092">arXiv:1708.09092v2</a>]. As a corollary we show that the Alexander polynomial $\Delta_{(G, c)}(t)$ studied in [<a href="/abs/1708.09092">arXiv:1708.09092v2</a>] coincides with $\underline{\Delta}(G, c)$ for a positive coloring $c$ of $G$, where $\Delta_{(G, c)}(t)$ is constructed from certain regular covering space of the complement of $G$ in $S^3$ and it is the Euler characteristic of the Heegaard Floer homology of $G$ that we studied before. When $G$ is a plane graph, we provide a topological interpretation to the vertex state sum of $\underline{\Delta}(G, c)$ by considering a special Heegaard diagram of $G$ and the Fox calculus on the Heegaard surface.;math.GT
1801.06304;A study of Landau damping with random initial inputs;For the Vlasov-Poisson equation with random uncertain initial data, we prove that the Landau damping solution given by the deterministic counterpart (Caglioti and Maffei, {\it J. Stat. Phys.}, 92:301-323, 1998) depends smoothly on the random variable if the time asymptotic profile does, under the smoothness and smallness assumptions similar to the deterministic case. The main idea is to generalize the deterministic contraction argument to more complicated function spaces to estimate derivatives in space, velocity and random variables. This result suggests that the random space regularity can persist in long-time even in time-reversible nonlinear kinetic equations.;math.AP
1801.06307;On the existence and regularity of vector solutions for quasilinear systems with linear coupling;We study a class of linearly coupled system of quasilinear equations. Under some assumptions on the nonlinear terms, we establish some results about the existence and regularity of vector solutions for the p-Laplacian systems by using variational methods. In particular, we get two pairs of nontrivial solutions. We also study their different asymptotic behavior of solutions as the coupling parameter tends to zero.;math.AP
1801.06308;An odd Khovanov homotopy type;For each link L in S^3 and every quantum grading j, we construct a stable homotopy type X^j_o(L) whose cohomology recovers Ozsvath-Rasmussen-Szabo's odd Khovanov homology, H_i(X^j_o(L)) = Kh^{i,j}_o(L), following a construction of Lawson-Lipshitz-Sarkar of the even Khovanov stable homotopy type. Furthermore, the odd Khovanov homotopy type carries a Z/2 action whose fixed point set is a desuspension of the even Khovanov homotopy type. We also construct a Z/2 action on an even Khovanov homotopy type, with fixed point set a desuspension of X^j_o(L).;math.GT
1801.06312;A functional logarithmic formula for hypergeometric functions 3F2;We give a sufficient condition for that the hypergeometric function 3F2 is a linear combination of the logarithmic function. The proof is based on the regulator formula which we proved in another preprint, <a href="/abs/1709.04144">arXiv:1709.04144</a>.;math.AG
1801.06315;Chained Successive Cancellation Decoding of the Extended Golay code;The extended Golay code is shown to be representable as a chained polar subcode. This enables its decoding with the successive cancellation algorithm and its stack generalization. The decoder can be further simplified by employing fast Hadamard transform. The complexity of the obtained algorithm is comparable with that of the Vardy algorithm.;cs.IT
1801.06318;The Gromov width of generalized Bott manifolds;By Delzant's theorem, closed symplectic toric manifolds are classified by the images of moment maps. In the case of a generalized Bott manifold, this image is a polytope $P$ combinatorially equivalent to the product of simplices. We compute the Gromov width of generalized Bott manifolds in terms of the defining inequalities of $P$.;math.SG
1801.06319;Single index regression models with randomly left-truncated data;In this paper, based on the kernel estimator proposed by Ould-Said and Lemdani (Ann. Instit. Statist. Math. 2006), we develop some new generalized M-estimator procedures for single index regression models with left-truncated responses. The consistency and asymptotic normality of our estimators are also established. Some simulation studies are given to investigate the finite sample performance of the proposed estimators.;math.ST
1801.06321;Examples of non-autonomous basins of attraction-II;The aim of this article is to enlarge the list of examples of non-autonomous basins of attraction from our previous paper and at the same time explore some other properties that they satisfy. For instance, we show the existence of countably many disjoint Short $\mathbb{C}^k$'s in $\mathbb{C}^k.$ We also construct a Short $\mathbb{C}^k$ which is not Runge and exhibit yet another example whose boundary has Hausdorff dimension $2k.$;math.CV
1801.06325;Markov-Dubins Interpolating Curves;A realistic generalization of the Markov--Dubins problem, which is concerned with finding the shortest planar curve of constrained curvature joining two points with prescribed tangents, is the requirement that the curve passes through a number of prescribed intermediate points/nodes. We refer to this generalization as the Markov--Dubins interpolation problem. We formulate this interpolation problem as an optimal control problem and obtain results about the structure of its solution using optimal control theory. The Markov--Dubins interpolants consist of a concatenation of circular ($C$) and straight-line ($S$) segments. Abnormal interpolating curves are shown to exist and characterized, however, if the interpolating curve contains a straight-line segment then it cannot be abnormal. We derive results about the stationarity, or criticality, of the feasible solutions of certain structure. In particular, any feasible interpolant with arc types of $CSC$ in each stage is proved to be stationary, i.e., critical. We propose a numerical method for computing Markov--Dubins interpolating paths. We illustrate the theory and the numerical approach by four qualitatively different examples.;math.OC
1801.06328;Asymptotic Analysis on Spatial Coupling Coding for Two-Way Relay Channels;Compute-and-forward relaying is effective to increase bandwidth efficiency of wireless two-way relay channels. In a compute-and-forward scheme, a relay tries to decode a linear combination composed of transmitted messages from other terminals or relays. Design for error correcting codes and its decoding algorithms suitable for compute-and-forward relaying schemes are still important issue to be studied. In this paper, we will present an asymptotic performance analysis on LDPC codes over two-way relay channels based on density evolution (DE). Because of the asymmetric nature of the channel, we employ the population dynamics DE combined with DE formulas for asymmetric channels to obtain BP thresholds. In addition, we also evaluate the asymptotic performance of spatially coupled LDPC codes for two-way relay channels. The results indicate that the spatial coupling codes yield improvements in the BP threshold compared with corresponding uncoupled codes for two-way relay channels.;cs.IT
1801.06329;On Hardy and Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities;We establish improved versions of the Hardy and Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities by replacing the standard Dirichlet energy with some nonlocal nonconvex functionals which have been involved in estimates for the topological degree of continuous maps from a sphere into itself and characterizations of Sobolev spaces.;math.CA
1801.06331;Central Limit Theorem for the number of real roots of Kostlan Shub Smale random polynomial systems;We obtain a Central Limit Theorem for the normalized number of real roots of a square Kostlan-Shub-Smale random polynomial system of any size as the degree goes to infinity. A study of the asymptotic variance of the number of roots is needed, this result was obtained in [2]. Afterwards we represent the number of roots as an explicit non linear functional belonging to the It{\^o}-Wiener chaos. This representation provides a tool for applying the Fourth Moment Theorem and henceforth the asymptotic normality.

1801.06333;On the Power Allocation Limits for Downlink Multi-user NOMA with QoS;The fundamental power allocation requirements for NOMA systems with minimum quality of service (QoS) requirements are investigated. For any minimum QoS rate $R_0$, the limits on the power allocation coefficients for each user are derived, such that any power allocation coefficient outside of these limits creates an outage with probability equal to 1. The power allocation coefficients that facilitate each user's success of performing successive interference cancellation (SIC) and decoding its own signal are derived, and are found to depend only on the target rate $R_0$ and the number of total users $K$. It is then proven that using these power allocation coefficients create the same outage event as if using orthogonal multiple access (OMA), which proves that the outage performance of NOMA with a fixed-power scheme can matched that of OMA for all users simultaneously. Simulations confirm the theoretical results, and also demonstrate that a power allocation strategy exists that can improve the outage performance of NOMA over OMA, even with a fixed-power strategy.;cs.IT
1801.06334;On the combinatorics of the Hopf algebra of dissection diagrams;In this article, we are interested in the Hopf algebra $\mathcal{H}_{D}$ of dissection diagrams introduced by Dupont in his thesis. We use the version with a parameter $x\in\mathbb{K}$. We want to study its underlying coalgebra. We conjecture it is cofree, except for a countable subset of $\mathbb{K}$. If $x=-1$ then we know there is no cofreedom. We easily see that $\mathcal{H}\_{D}$ is a free commutative right-sided combinatorial Hopf algebra according to Loday and Ronco. So, there exists a pre-Lie structure on its graded dual. Furthermore ${\mathcal{H}_{D}}^{\circledast}$ and the enveloping algebra of its primitive elements are isomorphic. Thus, we can equip ${\mathcal{H}\_{D}}^{\circledast}$ with a structure of Oudom and Guin. We focus on the pre-Lie structure on dissection diagrams and in particular on the pre-Lie algebra generated by the dissection diagram of degree $1$. We prove that it is not free. We express a Hopf algebra morphism between the Grossman and Larson Hopf algebra and ${\mathcal{H}_{D}}^{\circledast}$ by using pre-Lie and Oudom and Guin structures.;math.CO
1801.06335;Asymptotic stabilization of stationnary shock waves using a boundary feedback law;In this paper we consider scalar conservation laws with a convex flux. Given a stationnary shock, we provide a feedback law acting at one boundary point such that this solution is now asymptotically stable in L 1-norm in the class of entropy solution.;math.AP
1801.06336;Convergence and divergence of wavelet series: multifractal aspects;We study the convergence and divergence of the wavelet expansion of a function in a Sobolev or a Besov space from a multifractal point of view. In particular, we give an upper bound for the Hausdorff and for the packing dimension of the set of points where the expansion converges (or diverges) at a given speed, and we show that, generically, these bounds are optimal.;math.FA
1801.06338;Boolean constant degree functions on the slice are juntas;We show that a Boolean degree $d$ function on the slice $\binom{[n]}{k} = \{ (x_1,\ldots,x_n) \in \{0,1\} : \sum_{i=1}^n x_i = k \}$ is a junta, assuming that $k,n-k$ are large enough. This generalizes a classical result of Nisan and Szegedy on the hypercube. Moreover, we show that the maximum number of coordinates that a Boolean degree $d$ function can depend on is the same on the slice and the hypercube.;math.CO
1801.06339;Latt{&#xe8,}s maps and the interior of the bifurcation locus;We show the existence of open sets of bifurcations near Latt{\`e}s maps of sufficiently high degree. In particular, every Latt{\`e}s map has an iterate which is in the closure of the interior of the bifurcation locus. To show this, we design a method to intersect the limit set of some particular type of IFS with a well-oriented curve. Then, we show that a Latt{\`e}s map of sufficiently high degree can be perturbed to exhibit this geometry.;math.DS
1801.06344;A k-linear triangulated category without a model;In this paper we give an example of a triangulated category, linear over a field of characteristic zero, which does not carry a DG-enhancement. The only previous examples of triangulated categories without a model have been constructed by Muro, Schwede and Strickland. These examples are however not linear over a field.;math.AG
1801.06348;Higher order concentration for functions of weakly dependent random variables;We extend recent higher order concentration results in the discrete setting to include functions of possibly dependent variables whose distribution (on the product space) satisfies a logarithmic Sobolev inequality with respect to a difference operator that arises from Gibbs sampler type dynamics. Examples of such random variables include the Ising model on a graph with n nodes with general, but weak interactions, i.e. in the Dobrushin uniqueness regime, for which we prove concentration results of homogeneous polynomials, as well as random permutations, and slices of the hypercube with dynamics given by either the Bernoulli-Laplace or the symmetric simple exclusion processes.;math.PR
1801.06354;The Complexity of Primal-Dual Fixed Point Methods for Ridge Regression;We study the ridge regression (L2 regularized least squares) problem and its dual, which is also a ridge regression problem. We observe that the optimality conditions describing the primal and dual optimal solutions can be formulated in several different but equivalent ways. The optimality conditions we identify form a linear system involving a structured matrix depending on a single relaxation parameter which we introduce for regularization purposes. This leads to the idea of studying and comparing, in theory and practice, the performance of the fixed point method applied to these reformulations. We compute the optimal relaxation parameters and uncover interesting connections between the complexity bounds of the variants of the fixed point scheme we consider. These connections follow from a close link between the spectral properties of the associated matrices. For instance, some reformulations involve purely imaginary eigenvalues, some involve real eigenvalues and others have all eigenvalues on the complex circle. <br />We show that the deterministic Quartz method---which is a special case of the randomized dual coordinate ascent method with arbitrary sampling recently developed by Qu, Richt\'{a}rik and Zhang---can be cast in our framework, and achieves the best rate in theory and in numerical experiments among the fixed point methods we study. Remarkably, the method achieves an accelerated convergence rate. Numerical experiments indicate that our main algorithm is competitive with the conjugate gradient method.;math.NA
1801.06356;A Non-Intrusive Parallel-in-Time Approach for Simultaneous Optimization with Unsteady PDEs;This paper presents a non-intrusive framework for integrating existing unsteady partial differential equation (PDE) solvers into a parallel-in-time simultaneous optimization algorithm. The time-parallelization is provided by the non-intrusive software library XBraid, which applies an iterative multigrid reduction technique to the time domain of existing time-marching schemes for solving unsteady PDEs. Its general user-interface has been extended for computing adjoint sensitivities such that gradients of output quantities with respect to design changes can be computed parallel-in-time alongside with the primal PDE solution. In this paper, the primal and adjoint XBraid iterations are embedded into a simultaneous optimization framework, namely the One-shot method. In this method, design updates towards optimality are employed after each state and adjoint update such that optimality and feasibility of the design and the PDE solution are reached simultaneously. The time-parallel optimization method is validated on an advection-dominated flow control problem which shows significant speedup over a classical time-serial optimization algorithm.;math.OC
1801.06357;On the Modeling and Performance Assessment of Random Access with SIC;In this paper, we review the key figures of merit to assess the performance of advanced random access (RA) schemes exploiting physical layer coding, repetitions and collision resolution techniques. We then investigate RA modeling aspects and their impact on the figures of merit for the exemplary advanced RA schemes: Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted ALOHA (CRDSA), Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA (IRSA), Coded Slotted ALOHA (CSA) and Enhanced Spread-Spectrum ALOHA (E-SSA). We show that typical simplifications of the reception model when used to optimize RA schemes lead to inaccurate findings, both in terms of parameter optimization and figures of merit, such as the packet loss ratio (PLR) and throughput. We also derive a generic RA energy efficiency model able to compare the schemes in terms of the energy required to transmit a packet. The combination of achievable RA throughput at the target PLR and energy efficiency, for the same average user power investment per frame and occupied bandwidth, shows that E-SSA, which is an unslotted scheme, provides the best overall performance, while, in terms of the slotted schemes, CRDSA outperforms the more elaborated IRSA and CSA. This surprising results is due to the fact that the IRSA and CSA optimization has so far been performed using RA channel models that are not accurately reflecting the physical layer receiver behavior. We conclude by providing insights on how to include more accurate reception models in the IRSA and CSA design and optimization.;cs.IT
1801.06358;Sparse recovery based on q-ratio constrained minimal singular values;We study verifiable sufficient conditions and computable performance bounds for sparse recovery algorithms such as the Basis Pursuit, the Dantzig selector and the Lasso estimator, in terms of a newly defined family of quality measures for the measurement matrices. With high probability, the developed measures for subgaussian random matrices are bounded away from zero as long as the number of measurements is reasonably large. Comparing to the restricted isotropic constant based performance analysis, the arguments in this paper are much more concise and the obtained bounds are tighter. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate our theoretical results.;cs.IT
1801.06359;On connected preimages of simply-connected domains under entire functions;Let $f$ be a transcendental entire function, and let $U,V\subset\mathbb{C}$ be disjoint simply-connected domains. Must one of $f^{-1}(U)$ and $f^{-1}(V)$ be disconnected? <br />In 1970, Baker implicitly gave a positive answer to this question, in order to prove that a transcendental entire function cannot have two disjoint completely invariant domains. (A domain $U\subset \mathbb{C}$ is completely invariant under $f$ if $f^{-1}(U)=U$.) <br />It was recently observed by Julien Duval that there is a flaw in Baker's argument (which has also been used in later generalisations and extensions of Baker's result). We show that the answer to the above question is negative, so this flaw cannot be repaired. Indeed, for the function $f(z)= e^z+z$, there is a collection of infinitely many pairwise disjoint simply-connected domains, each with connected preimage. We also answer a long-standing question of Eremenko by giving an example of a transcendental entire function, with infinitely many poles, which has the same property. <br />Furthermore, we show that there exists a function $f$ with the above properties such that additionally the set of singular values $S(f)$ is bounded, in other words, $f$ belongs to the Eremenko-Lyubich class. On the other hand, if $S(f)$ is finite (or if certain additional hypotheses are imposed), many of the original results do hold. <br />For the convenience of the research community, we also include a description of the error in the proof of Baker's paper, and a summary of other papers that are affected.;math.DS
1801.06361;Discontinuous Galerkin Time Discretization Methods for Parabolic Problems with Linear Constraints;We consider time discretization methods for abstract parabolic problems with inhomogeneous linear constraints. Prototype examples that fit into the general framework are the heat equation with inhomogeneous (time dependent) Dirichlet boundary conditions and the time dependent Stokes equation with an inhomogeneous divergence constraint. Two common ways of treating such linear constraints, namely explicit or implicit (via Lagrange multipliers) are studied. These different treatments lead to different variational formulations of the parabolic problem. For these formulations we introduce a modification of the standard discontinuous Galerkin (DG) time discretization method in which an appropriate projection is used in the discretization of the constraint. For these discretizations (optimal) error bounds, including superconvergence results, are derived. Discretization error bounds for the Lagrange multiplier are presented. Results of experiments confirm the theoretically predicted optimal convergence rates and show that without the modification the (standard) DG method has sub-optimal convergence behavior.;math.NA
1801.06366;Lyapunov stability of differential inclusions with Lipschitz Cusco perturbations of maximal monotone operators;We give criteria for weak and strong invariant closed sets for differential inclusions given in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and governed by Lipschitz Cusco perturbations of maximal monotone operators. Correspondingly, we provide different characterizations for the\ associated strong Lyapunov functions. The resulting conditions only depend on the data of the system.;math.OC
1801.06369;An efficient shape parametrisation by free-form deformation enhanced by active subspace for hull hydrodynamic ship design problems in open source environment;In this contribution, we present the results of the application of a parameter space reduction methodology based on active subspaces to the hull hydrodynamic design problem. Several parametric deformations of an initial hull shape are considered to assess the influence of the shape parameters considered on the hull total drag. The hull resistance is typically computed by means of numerical simulations of the hydrodynamic flow past the ship. Given the high number of parameters involved - which might result in a high number of time consuming hydrodynamic simulations - assessing whether the parameters space can be reduced would lead to considerable computational cost reduction. Thus, the main idea of this work is to employ the active subspaces to identify possible lower dimensional structures in the parameter space, or to verify the parameter distribution in the position of the control points. To this end, a fully automated procedure has been implemented to produce several small shape perturbations of an original hull CAD geometry which are then used to carry out high-fidelity flow simulations and collect data for the active subspaces analysis. To achieve full automation of the open source pipeline described, both the free form deformation methodology employed for the hull perturbations and the solver based on unsteady potential flow theory, with fully nonlinear free surface treatment, are directly interfaced with CAD data structures and operate using IGES vendor-neutral file formats as input files. The computational cost of the fluid dynamic simulations is further reduced through the application of dynamic mode decomposition to reconstruct the steady state total drag value given only few initial snapshots of the simulation. The active subspaces analysis is here applied to the geometry of the DTMB-5415 naval combatant hull, which is a common benchmark in ship hydrodynamics simulations.;math.NA
1801.06370;Derived equivalences of gentle algebras via Fukaya categories;Following the approach of Haiden-Katzarkov-Kontsevich <a href="/abs/1409.8611">arXiv:1409.8611</a>, to any homologically smooth graded gentle algebra $A$ we associate a triple $(\Sigma_A, \Lambda_A, \eta_A)$, where $\Sigma_A$ is an oriented smooth surface with non-empty boundary, $\Lambda_A$ is a set of stops on $\partial \Sigma_A$ and $\eta_A$ is a line field on $\Sigma_A$, such that the derived category of perfect dg-modules of $A$ is equivalent to the partially wrapped Fukaya category of $(\Sigma_A, \Lambda_A ,\eta_A)$. Modifying arguments of Johnson and Kawazumi, we classify the orbit decomposition of the action of the (symplectic) mapping class group of $\Sigma_A$ on the homotopy classes of line fields. As a result we obtain a sufficient criterion for homologically smooth graded gentle algebras to be derived equivalent. Our criterion uses numerical invariants generalizing those given by Avella-Alaminos-Geiss in <a href="/abs/math/0607348">math/0607348</a>, as well as some other numerical invariants. As an application, we find many new cases when the AAG-invariants determine the derived Morita class. As another application, we establish some derived equivalences between the stacky nodal curves considered in <a href="/abs/1705.06023">arXiv:1705.06023</a>.;math.SG
1801.06374;Energy-Efficient SWIPT in IoT Distributed Antenna Systems;The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) dramatically increases power consumption of wireless devices. Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is a promising solution for sustainable operation of IoT devices. In this paper, we study energy efficiency (EE) in SWIPT-based distributed antenna system (DAS), where power splitting (PS) is applied at IoT devices to coordinate the energy harvesting (EH) and information decoding (ID) processes by varying transmit power of distributed antenna (DA) ports and PS ratios of IoT devices. In the case of single IoT device, we find the optimal closed-form solution by deriving some useful properties based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and the solution is no need for numerical iterations. For the case of multiple IoT devices, we propose an efficient suboptimal algorithm to solve the EE maximization problem. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes achieve better EE performance compared with other benchmark schemes in both single and multiple IoT devices cases.;cs.IT
1801.06376;Partition quantum spaces;We propose a definition of partition quantum spaces. They are given by universal $C^*$-algebras whose relations come from partitions of sets. We ask for the maximal compact matrix quantum group acting on them. We show how those fit into the setting of easy quantum groups: Our approach yields spaces these groups are acting on. In a way, our partition quantum spaces arise as the first $d$ columns of easy quantum groups. However, we define them as universal $C^*$-algebras rather than as $C^*$-subalgebras of easy quantum groups. We also investigate the minimal number $d$ needed to recover an easy quantum group as the quantum symmetry group of a partition quantum space. In the free unitary case, $d$ takes the values one or two.;math.OA
1801.06379;On optimal control of free boundary problems of obstacle type;A numerical study of an optimal control formulation for a shape optimization problem governed by an elliptic variational inequality is performed. The shape optimization problem is reformulated as a boundary control problem in a fixed domain. The discretized optimal control problem is a non-smooth and non-convex mathematical programing problem. The performance of the standard BFGS quasi-Newton method and the BFGS method with the inexact line search are tested.;math.OC
1801.06380;The geometry of corank $1$ surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^{4}$;We study the geometry of surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^{4}$ with corank $1$ singularities. For such surfaces the singularities are isolated and at each point we define the curvature parabola in the normal space. This curve codifies all the second order information of the surface. Also, using this curve we define asymptotic and binormal directions, the umbilic curvature and study the flat geometry of the surface. It is shown that we can associate to this singular surface a regular one in $\mathbb{R}^{4}$ and relate their geometry.;math.DG
1801.06384;Difference sets and power residues;Let $p\geq 3$ be a prime and $n\geq 1$ be an integer. Let $K\subseteq {\mathbb{F}_p}$ denote a fixed subset with $0\in K$. Let $A\subseteq ({\mathbb{F}_p})^n$ be an arbitrary subset such that $$\{ \mathbf{a}-\mathbf{b}:~\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\in A,\mathbf{a}\neq \mathbf{b}\}\cap K^n=\emptyset. $$ Then we prove the exponential upper bound $$ |A|\leq ( p-|K|+ 1 )^n. $$ <br />We use in our proof the linear algebra bound method.;math.NT
1801.06386;Profinite rigidity of graph manifolds, II: knots and mapping classes;In this paper we study some consequences of the author's classification of graph manifolds by their profinite fundamental groups. In particular we study commensurability, the behaviour of knots, and relation to mapping classes. We prove that the exteriors of graph knots are distinguished among all 3-manifold groups by their profinite fundamental groups. We also prove a strong conjugacy separability result for certain mapping classes of surfaces.;math.GT
1801.06387;Closed form expression of the multivariate standard Normal distribution under a weighted sum constraint;In this letter we derive the $(n-1)$-dimensional distribution corresponding to a $n$-dimensional i.i.d. Normal standard vector $Z=(Z_1,Z_2,\ldots,Z_n)$ subjected to the weighted sum constraint $\sum_{i=1}^n w_i Z_i=c$, $w_i\neq 0$. We first address the $n=2$ case before proceeding with the general $n\geq 2$ case. The resulting distribution is a Normal distribution whose mean vector $\mu$ and covariance matrix $\Sigma$ are explicitly derived as a function of $w_1,\ldots,w_n,c$. The derivation of the density relies on a very specific positive definite matrix for which the determinant and inverse can be computed analytically.;math.PR
1801.06388;A note on multivariable $(\varphi,&#x393,)$-modules;Let $F/{\mathbb Q}_p$ be a finite field extension, let $k$ be a field of characteristic $p$. Fix a Lubin Tate group $\Phi$ for $F$ and let $\Gamma\times\cdots\times\Gamma$ with $\Gamma={\mathcal O}_F^{\times}$ act on $k[[t_1,\ldots,t_n]][\prod_it_i^{-1}]$ by letting $\gamma_i$ (in the $i$-th factor $\Gamma$) act on $t_i$ by insertion of $t_i$ into the power series attached to $\gamma_i$ by $\Phi$. We show that $k[[t_1,\ldots,t_n]][\prod_it_i^{-1}]$ admits no non-trivial ideal stable under $\Gamma$, thereby generalizing a result of Z\'{a}br\'{a}di (who had treated the case where $\Phi$ is the multiplicative group). We then discuss applications to $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules over $k[[t_1,\ldots,t_n]][\prod_it_i^{-1}]$.;math.NT
1801.06390;Ramanujan&#x27,s Master Theorem and two formulas for zero-order Hankel transform;Using Ramanujan's Master Theorem, two formulas are derived which define the Hankel transforms of order zero with even functions by inverse Mellin transforms, provided these functions and their derivatives obey special conditions. Their validity is illustrated by a number of examples. With a help of one of these formulas, one as yet unknown parametric improper integral of the Bessel function J_0(x) is calculated.;math.CA
1801.06398;Hardy-Lieb-Thirring Inequalities for Fractional Pauli Operators;We provide lower bounds for the sum of the negative eigenvalues of the operator $|\sigma\cdot p_A|^{2s} - C_s/|x|^{2s} + V$ in three dimensions, where $s\in (0, 1]$, covering the interesting physical cases $s = 1$ and $s = 1/2$. Here $\sigma$ is the vector of Pauli matrices, $p_A = p - A$, with $p = -i\nabla$ the three-dimensional momentum operator and $A$ a given magnetic vector potential, and $C_s$ is the critical Hardy constant, that is, the optimal constant in the Hardy inequality $|p|^{2s} \geq C_s/|x|^{2s}$. If spin is neglected, results of this type are known in the literature as Hardy-Lieb-Thirring inequalities, which bound the sum of negative eigenvalues from below by $-M_s\int V_{-}^{1 + 3/(2s)}$, for a positive constant $M_s$. The inclusion of magnetic fields in this case follows from the non-magnetic case by diamagnetism. The addition of spin, however, offers extra challenges that make the result more elusive. It is the purpose of this article to resolve this problem by providing simple bounds for the sum of the negative eigenvalues of the operator in question. In particular, for $1/2 \leq s \leq 1$ we are able to express the bound purely in terms of the magnetic field energy $\|B\|_2^2$ and integrals of powers of the negative part of $V$.;math-ph
1801.06399;Palais-Smale sequences for the fractional CR Yamabe functional and multiplicity results;In this paper we consider the functional whose critical points are solutions of the fractional CR Yamabe type equation on the sphere. We firstly study the behavior of the Palais-Smale sequences characterizing the bubbling phenomena and therefore we prove a multiplicity type result by showing the existence of infinitely many solutions to the related equation.;math.AP
1801.06403;The Conley index for discrete dynamical systems and the mapping torus;The Conley index for flows is a topological invariant describing the behavior around an isolated invariant set $S$. It is defined as the homotopy type of a quotient space $N/L$, where $(N,L)$ is an index pair for $S$. In the case of a discrete dynamical system, i.e., a continuous self-map $f\colon X\to X$, the definition is similar. But one needs to consider the index map $f_{(N,L)}\colon N/L\to N/L$ induced by $f$. The Conley index in this situation is defined as the homotopy class $[f_{(N,L)}]$ modulo shift equivalence. The shift equivalence relation is rarely used outside this context and not well understood in general. For practical purposes like numerical computations, one needs to use weaker algebraic invariants for distinguishing Conley indices, usually homology. Here we consider a topological invariant: the homotopy type of the mapping torus of the index map $f_{(N,L)}$. Using a homotopy type offers new ways for comparing Conley indices -- theoretically and numerically. We present some basic properties and examples, compare it to the definition via shift equivalence and sketch an idea for its construction using rigorous numerics.;math.DS
1801.06404;A linear programming method for exponential domination;For a graph $G,$ the set $D \subseteq V(G)$ is a porous exponential dominating set if $1 \le \sum_{d \in D} \left( 2 \right)^{1-dist(d,v)}$ for every $v \in V(G),$ where $dist(d,v)$ denotes the length of the shortest $dv$ path. The porous exponential dominating number of $G,$ denoted $\gamma_e^*(G),$ is the minimum cardinality of a porous exponential dominating set. For any graph $G,$ a technique is derived to determine a lower bound for $\gamma_e^*(G).$ Specifically for a grid graph $H,$ linear programing is used to sharpen bound found through the lower bound technique. Lower and upper bounds are determined for the porous exponential domination number of the King Grid $\mathcal{K_n},$ the Slant Grid $\mathcal{S_n},$ and the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n.$;math.CO
1801.06410;The $\mathcal L_B$-cohomology on compact torsion-free $\mathrm{G}_2$ manifolds and an application to &#x27,almost&#x27, formality;We study a cohomology theory $H^{\bullet}_{\varphi}$, called the $\mathcal L_B$-cohomology, on compact torsion-free $\mathrm{G}_2$-manifolds. We show that $H^k_{\varphi} \cong H^k_{\mathrm{dR}}$ for $k \neq 3, 4$, but that $H^k_{\varphi}$ is infinite-dimensional for $k = 3,4$. Nevertheless there is a canonical injection $H^k_{\mathrm{dR}} \to H^k_{\varphi}$. The $\mathcal L_B$-cohomology also satisfies a Poincar\'e duality induced by the Hodge star. The establishment of these results requires a delicate analysis of the interplay between the exterior derivative $\mathrm{d}$ and the derivation $\mathcal L_B$, and uses both Hodge theory and the special properties of $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures in an essential way. As an application of our results, we prove that compact torsion-free $\mathrm{G}_2$-manifolds are 'almost formal' in the sense that most of the Massey triple products necessarily must vanish.;math.DG
1801.06413;Large deviation for return times;We prove a large deviation result for return times of the orbits of a dynamical system in a $r$-neighbourhood of an initial point $x$. <br />Our result may be seen as a differentiable version of the work by Jain and Bansal who considered the return time of a stationary and ergodic process defined in a space of infinite sequences.;math.DS
1801.06419;Controlling nonlinear PDEs using low-dimensional bilinear approximations obtained from data;In a recent article, we presented a framework to control nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) by means of Koopman operator based reduced models and concepts from switched systems. The main idea was to transform a control system into a set of autonomous systems for which the optimal switching sequence has to be computed. These individual systems can be approximated very efficiently by reduced order models obtained from data, and one can guarantee equality of the full and the reduced objective function under certain assumptions. In this article, we extend these results to continuous control inputs using convex combinations of multiple Koopman operators corresponding to constant controls, which results in a bilinear control system. Although equality of the objectives can be carried over when the PDE depends linearly on the control, we show that this approach is also valid in other scenarios using several flow control examples of varying complexity.;math.OC
1801.06420;Long-time asymptotics for the Sasa-Satsuma equation via nonlinear steepest descent method;We formulate a $3\times3$ Riemann-Hilbert problem to solve the Cauchy problem for the Sasa-Satsuma equation on the line, which allows us to give a representation for the solution of Sasa-Satsuma equation. We then apply the method of nonlinear steepest descent to compute the long-time asymptotics of the Sasa-Satsuma equation.;math.AP
1801.06424;Highly oscillatory unimodular Fourier multipliers on modulation spaces;We study the continuity on the modulation spaces $M^{p,q}$ of Fourier multipliers with symbols of the type $e^{i\mu(\xi)}$, for some real-valued function $\mu(\xi)$. A number of results are known, assuming that the derivatives of order $\geq 2$ of the phase $\mu(\xi)$ are bounded or, more generally, that its second derivatives belong to the Sj\"ostrand class $M^{\infty,1}$. Here we extend those results, by assuming that the second derivatives lie in the bigger Wiener amalgam space $W(\mathcal{F} L^1,L^\infty)$, in particular they could have stronger oscillations at infinity such as $\cos |\xi|^2$. Actually our main result deals with the more general case of possibly unbounded second derivatives. In that case we have boundedness on weighted modulation spaces with a sharp loss of derivatives.;math.FA
1801.06426;Path Decomposition of Spectrally Negative Levy Processes;Path decomposition is performed to analyze the pre-supremum, post-supremum, post-infimum and the intermediate processes of a spectrally negative Levy process taken up to an independent exponential time T as motivated by the aim of finding the joint distribution of the maximum loss and maximum gain. In addition, the joint distribution of the supremum and the infimum before an exponential time is displayed. As an application of path decomposition, the distributions of supremum of the post-infimum process and the maximum loss of the post-supremum process are obtained.;math.PR
1801.06427;Freudenthal theorem and spherical classes in $H_*QS^0$;This note is on spherical classes in $H_*(QS^0,k)$ when $k=\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z}/p$ with a special focus on the case of $p=2$ related to Curtis conjecture. We apply Freudenthal theorem to prove a vanishing result for the Hurewicz image of elements in ${\pi_*^s}$ that factor through certain finite spectra. Either in $p$-local or $p$-complete settings, this immediately implies that elements of well known infinite families in ${_p\pi_*^s}$, such as Mahowaldean families, map trivially under the unstable Hurewicz homomorphism ${_p\pi_*^s}\simeq{_p\pi_*}QS^0\to H_*(QS^0,\mathbb{Z}/p)$. We also observe that the image of the integral unstable Hurewicz homomorphism $\pi_*^s\simeq\pi_*QS^0\to H_*(QS^0,\mathbb{Z})$ when restricted to the submodule of decomposable elements, is given by $\mathbb{Z}\{h(\eta^2),h(\nu^2),h(\sigma^2)\}$. We apply this latter to completely determine spherical classes in $H_*(\Omega^dS^{n+d},\mathbb{Z}/2)$ for certain values of $n&gt,0$ and $d&gt,0$, this verifies a Eccles' conjecture on spherical classes in $H_*QS^n$, $n&gt,0$, on finite loop spaces associated to spheres.;math.AT
1801.06429;On the stability of periodic N-body motions with the symmetry of Platonic polyhedra;In (Fusco et. al., 2011) several periodic orbits of the Newtonian N-body problem have been found as minimizers of the Lagrangian action in suitable sets of T-periodic loops, for a given T&gt,0. Each of them share the symmetry of one Platonic polyhedron. <br />In this paper we first present an algorithm to enumerate all the orbits that can be found following the proof in (Fusco et. al., 2011). Then we describe a procedure aimed to compute them and study their stability. Our computations suggest that all these periodic orbits are unstable. For some cases we produce a computer-assisted proof of their instability using multiple precision interval arithmetic.;math-ph
1801.06430;Convergence Analysis of Belief Propagation on Gaussian Graphical Models;Gaussian belief propagation (GBP) is a recursive computation method that is widely used in inference for computing marginal distributions efficiently. Depending on how the factorization of the underlying joint Gaussian distribution is performed, GBP may exhibit different convergence properties as different factorizations may lead to fundamentally different recursive update structures. In this paper, we study the convergence of GBP derived from the factorization based on the distributed linear Gaussian model. The motivation is twofold. From the factorization viewpoint, i.e., by specifically employing a factorization based on the linear Gaussian model, in some cases, we are able to bypass difficulties that exist in other convergence analysis methods that use a different (Gaussian Markov random field) factorization. From the distributed inference viewpoint, the linear Gaussian model readily conforms to the physical network topology arising in large-scale networks, and, is practically useful. For the distributed linear Gaussian model, under mild assumptions, we show analytically three main results: the GBP message inverse variance converges exponentially fast to a unique positive limit for arbitrary nonnegative initialization, we provide a necessary and sufficient convergence condition for the belief mean to converge to the optimal value, and, when the underlying factor graph is given by the union of a forest and a single loop, we show that GBP always converges.;cs.IT
1801.06431;On Conjugation orbits of semisimple pairs in rank one;We consider Lie groups ${\rm SU}(n,1)$ and ${\rm Sp}(n,1)$ that act as the isometries of the complex and quaternionic hyperbolic spaces respectively. We classify pairs of semisimple elements in ${\rm Sp}(n,1)$ and ${\rm SU}(n,1)$ up to conjugacy. This gives local parametrization of the representations $\rho$ in $Hom(F_2, G)/G$ such that both $\rho(x)$ and $\rho(y)$ are hyperbolics, where $F_2=\langle x, y\rangle$, $G={\rm Sp}(n,1)$ or ${\rm SU}(n,1)$. We use the ${\rm PSp}(n,1)$-configuration space $M(n,i,m-i)$ of ordered $m$-tuples of points on $\overline{{\bf H}_{\mathbb H}^n}$, where first $i$ points in an $m$-tuple are null points, to classify the semisimple pairs. Further, we also classify points on $M(n,i,m-i)$.;math.GT

1801.06455;Analysis of Some Splitting Schemes for the Stochastic Allen-Cahn Equation;We introduce and analyze an explicit time discretization scheme for the one-dimensional stochastic Allen-Cahn, driven by space-time white noise. The scheme is based on a splitting strategy, and uses the exact solution for the nonlinear term contribution. We first prove boundedness of moments of the numerical solution. We then prove strong convergence results: first, L^2 ($\Omega$)-convergence of order almost 1/4, localized on an event of arbitrarily large probability, then convergence in probability of order almost 1/4. The theoretical analysis is supported by numerical experiments, concerning strong and weak orders of convergence.;math.NA
1801.06461;Existence of three positive solutions for a nonlocal singular dirichlet boundary problem;In this article, we prove the existence of at least three positive solutions for the following nonlocal singular problem \begin{equation*} (P_\la)\left\{ \begin{split} (-\De)^su &amp,= \la\frac{f(u)}{u^q}, \, \, u&gt,0 \,\, \text{in}\,\, \Om,\\ u &amp,= 0\,\, \text{in}\,\, \mb R^n \setminus \Om \end{split} \right. \end{equation*} where $(-\De)^s$ denotes the fractional Laplace operator for $s\in (0,1)$, $n&gt,2s$, $q \in (0,1)$, $\la&gt,0$ and $\Om$ is smooth bounded domain in $\mb R^n$. Here $f :[0,\infty) \to [0,\infty)$ is a continuous nondecreasing map satisfying $\lim\limits_{u\to \infty}\frac{f(u)}{u^{q+1}}=0$. We show that under certain additional assumptions on $f$, $(P_\la)$ possesses at least three distinct solutions for a certain range of $\la$. We use the method of sub-supersolutions and a critical point theorem by Amann \cite{amann} to prove our results. Moreover, we prove a new existence result for a suitable infinite semipositone nonlocal problem which played a crucial role to obtain our main result and is of independent interest. \medskip;math.AP
1801.06466;Spectral expansion of random sum complexes;Let $G$ be a finite abelian group of order $n$ and let $\Delta_{n-1}$ denote the $(n-1)$-simplex on the vertex set $G$. The sum complex $X_{A,k}$ associated to a subset $A \subset G$ and $k &lt, n$, is the $k$-dimensional simplicial complex obtained by taking the full $(k-1)$-skeleton of $\Delta_{n-1}$ together with all $(k+1)$-subsets $\sigma \subset G$ that satisfy $\sum_{x \in \sigma} x \in A$. Let $C^{k-1}(X_{A,k})$ denote the space of complex valued $(k-1)$-cochains of $X_{A,k}$. Let $L_{k-1}:C^{k-1}(X_{A,k}) \rightarrow C^{k-1}(X_{A,k})$ denote the reduced $(k-1)$-th Laplacian of $X_{A,k}$, and let $\mu_{k-1}(X_{A,k})$ be the minimal eigenvalue of $L_{k-1}$. It is shown that for any $k \geq 1$ and $\epsilon&gt,0$ there exists a constant $c(k,\epsilon)$ such that if $A$ is a random subset of $G$ of size $m=\lceil c(k,\epsilon) \log n \rceil$, then $\mu_{k-1}(X_{A,k}) &gt, (1-\epsilon)m$ asymptotically almost surely.;math.CO
1801.06468;Projections of Gibbs measures on self-conformal sets;We show that for Gibbs measures on self-conformal sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ $(d\ge2)$ satisfying certain minimal assumptions, without requiring any separation condition, the Hausdorff dimension of orthogonal projections to $k$-dimensional subspaces is the same and is equal to the maximum possible value in all directions. As a corollary we show that Falconer's distance set conjecture holds for this class of self-conformal sets satisfying the open set condition.;math.DS
1801.06470;Stability estimates for systems with small cross-diffusion;We discuss the analysis and stability of a family of cross-diffusion boundary value problems with nonlinear diffusion and drift terms. We assume that these systems are close, in a suitable sense, to a set of decoupled and linear problems. We focus on stability estimates, that is, continuous dependence of solutions with respect to the nonlinearities in the diffusion and in the drift terms. We establish well-posedness and stability estimates in an appropriate Banach space. Under additional assumptions we show that these estimates are time independent. These results apply to several problems from mathematical biology, they allow comparisons between the solutions of different models a priori. For specific cell motility models from the literature, we illustrate the limit of the stability estimates we have derived numerically, and we document the behaviour of the solutions for extremal values of the parameters.;math.AP
1801.06472;A support theorem for the X-ray transform on manifolds with plane covers;This article is concerned with support theorems of the X-ray transform on non-compact manifolds with conjugate points. In particular, we prove that all simply connected 2-step nilpotent Lie groups have a support theorem. Important ingredients of the proof are the concept of plane covers and a support theorem for simple manifolds by Krishnan.We also provide examples of non-homogeneous 3-dimensional simply connected manifolds with conjugate points which have support theorems.;math.DG
1801.06473;Crossing a fitness valley as a metastable transition in a stochastic population model;We consider a stochastic model of population dynamics where each individual is characterised by a trait in {0,1,...,L} and has a natural reproduction rate, a logistic death rate due to age or competition and a probability of mutation towards neighbouring traits at each reproduction event. We choose parameters such that the induced fitness landscape exhibits a valley: mutant individuals with negative fitness have to be created in order for the population to reach a trait with positive fitness. We focus on the limit of large population and rare mutations at several speeds. In particular, when the mutation rate is low enough, metastability occurs: the exit time of the valley is random, exponentially distributed.;math.PR
1801.06474;Some Minimal Rings Related to 2-Primal Rings;In a paper on the taxonomy of 2-primal rings, examples of various types of rings that are related to commutativity such as reduced, symmetric, duo, reversible and PS~I were given in order to show that the ring class inclusions were strict. Many of the rings given in the examples were infinite. In this paper, where possible, examples of minimal finite rings of the various types are given. Along with the rings in the previous taxonomy, NI, abelian and reflexive rings are also included.;math.RA
1801.06479;Stochastic optimal control of a domestic microgrid equipped with solar panel and battery;Microgrids are integrated systems that gather and operate energy production units to satisfy consumers demands. This paper details different mathematical methods to design the Energy Management System (EMS) of domestic microgrids. We consider different stocks coupled together - a battery, a domestic hot water tank - and decentralized energy production with solar panel. The main challenge of the EMS is to ensure, at least cost, that supply matches demand for all time, while considering the inherent uncertainties of such systems. We benchmark two optimization algorithms to manage the EMS, and compare them with a heuristic. The Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a well known algorithm which models the future uncertainties with a deterministic forecast. By contrast, Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP) models the future uncertainties as probability distributions to compute optimal policies. We present a fair comparison of these two algorithms to control microgrid. A comprehensive numerical study shows that i) optimization algorithms achieve significant gains compared to the heuristic, ii) SDDP outperforms MPC by a few percents, with a reasonable computational overhead.;math.OC

1801.06488;Biproducts without pointedness;We show how to define biproducts up to isomorphism in an arbitrary category without assuming any enrichment. The resulting notion coincides with the usual definitions whenever all binary biproducts exist or the category is suitably enriched, resulting in a modest yet strict generalization otherwise. We also characterize when a category has all binary biproducts in terms of an ambidextrous adjunction. Finally, we give some new examples of biproducts that our definition recognizes.;math.CT
1801.06497;The Cicho&#x144, Diagram for Degrees of Relative Constructibility;Following a line of research initiated in \cite{BBNN}, I describe a general framework for turning reduction concepts of relative computability into diagrams forming an analogy with the Cicho\'n diagram for cardinal characteristics of the continuum. I show that working from relatively modest assumptions about a notion of reduction, one can construct a robust version of such a diagram. As an application, I define and investigate the Cicho\'n Diagram for degrees of constructibility relative to a fixed inner model $W$. Many analogies hold with the classical theory as well as some surprising differences. Along the way I introduce a new axiom stating, roughly, that the constructibility diagram is as complex as possible.;math.LO
1801.06500;Total dominator chromatic number of $k$-subdivision of graphs;Let $G$ be a simple graph. A total dominator coloring of $G$, is a proper coloring of the vertices of $G$ in which each vertex of the graph is adjacent to every vertex of some color class. The total dominator chromatic (TDC) number $\chi_d^t(G)$ of $G$, is the minimum number of colors among all total dominator coloring of $G$. For any $k \in \mathbb{N}$, the $k$-subdivision of $G$ is a simple graph $G^{\frac{1}{k}}$ which is constructed by replacing each edge of $G$ with a path of length $k$. In this paper, we study the total dominator chromatic number of $k$-subdivision of $G$.;math.CO
1801.06501;Expansion of Iterated Stochastic Integrals with Respect to Martingale Poisson Measures and with Respect to Martingales Based on Generalized Multiple Fourier Series;We consider some versions and generalizations of the approach to expansion of iterated Ito stochastic integrals of arbitrary multiplicity $k$ $(k\in\mathbb{N})$ based on generalized multiple Fourier series. The expansions of iterated stochastic integrals with respect to martingale Poisson measures and with respect to martingales were obtained. For the iterated stochastic integrals with respect to martingales we have proved two theorems. The first theorem is the generalization of expansion for iterated Ito stochastic integrals of arbitrary multiplicity based on generalized multiple Fourier series. The second one is the modification of the first theorem for the case of complete orthonormal with weight $r(t_1)\ldots r(t_k)\ge 0$ systems of functions in the space $L_2([t, T]^k)$ (in the first theorem $r(t_1)\ldots r(t_k)\equiv 1$). Mean-square convergence of the considered expansions is proved. The example of expansion of iterated (double) stochastic integrals with respect to martingales with using the system of Bessel functions is considered.;math.PR
1801.06507;Continuation method for PDE-constrained global optimization: Analysis and application to the shallow water equations;This paper shows how a class of non-convex optimization problems constrained by discretized nonlinear partial differential equations may be solved to global optimality using an interior point continuation method. The solution procedure rests on a nested homotopy. The inner homotopy solves a barrier problem by driving the barrier parameter to zero. The outer homotopy deforms a convex relaxation to the original non-convex problem in a way that stays clear of bifurcations. A requirement for global optimality is that the objective is convex and that the search space remains path-connected. As a case study, a class of real-world optimization problems subject to the shallow water equations is analyzed. A benchmark as well as a practical implementation demonstrate that the approach is suitable for closed-loop non-convex model predictive control of large-scale cyber-physical systems.;math.OC
1801.06515;Linear space properties of $H^p$ spaces of Dirichlet series;We study $H^p$ spaces of Dirichlet series, called $\mathcal{H}^p$, for the range $0&lt,p&lt, \infty$. We begin by showing that two natural ways to define $\mathcal{H}^p$ coincide. We then proceed to study some linear space properties of $\mathcal{H}^p$. More specifically, we study linear functionals generated by fractional primitives of the Riemann zeta function, our estimates rely on certain Hardy--Littlewood inequalities and display an interesting phenomenon, called contractive symmetry between $\mathcal{H}^p$ and $\mathcal{H}^{4/p}$, contrasting the usual $L^p$ duality. We next deduce general coefficient estimates, based on an interplay between the multiplicative structure of $\mathcal{H}^p$ and certain new one variable bounds. Finally, we deduce general estimates for the norm of the partial sum operator $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n n^{-s}\mapsto \sum_{n=1}^N a_n n^{-s}$ on $\mathcal{H}^p$ with $0&lt, p \le 1$, supplementing a classical result of Helson for the range $1&lt,p&lt,\infty$. The results for the coefficient estimates and for the partial sum operator exhibit the traditional schism between the ranges $1\le p \le \infty$ and $0&lt,p&lt,1$.;math.FA
1801.06517;Fundamental Gaps of the Fractional Schr&#xf6,dinger Operator;We study asymptotically and numerically the fundamental gap -- the difference between the first two smallest (and distinct) eigenvalues -- of the fractional Schr\"{o}dinger operator (FSO) and formulate a gap conjecture on the fundamental gap of the FSO. We begin with an introduction of the FSO on bounded domains with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, while the fractional Laplacian operator defined either via the local fractional Laplacian (i.e. via the eigenfunctions decomposition of the Laplacian operator) or via the classical fractional Laplacian (i.e. zero extension of the eigenfunctions outside the bounded domains and then via the Fourier transform). For the FSO on bounded domains with either the local fractional Laplacian or the classical fractional Laplacian, we obtain the fundamental gap of the FSO analytically on simple geometry without potential and numerically on complicated geometries and/or with different convex potentials. Based on the asymptotic and extensive numerical results, a gap conjecture on the fundamental gap of the FSO is formulated. Surprisingly, for two and higher dimensions, the lower bound of the fundamental gap depends not only on the diameter of the domain, but also the diameter of the largest inscribed ball of the domain, which is completely different from the case of the Schr\"{o}dinger operator. Extensions of these results for the FSO in the whole space and on bounded domains with periodic boundary conditions are presented.;math.AP
1801.06524;Comparison of two combinatorial models of global network dynamics;Modeling the dynamics of biological networks introduces many challenges, among them the lack of first principle models, the size of the networks, and difficulties with parameterization. Discrete time Boolean networks and related continuous time switching systems provide a computationally accessible way to translate the structure of the network to predictions about the dynamics. Recent work has shown that the parameterized dynamics of switching systems can be captured by a combinatorial object, called a DSGRN database, that consists of a parameter graph characterizing a finite parameter space decomposition, whose nodes are assigned a Morse graph that captures global dynamics for all corresponding parameters. <br />We show that for a given network there is a way to associate the same type of object by considering a continuous time ODE system with a continuous right-hand side, which we call an L-system. The main goal of this paper is to compare the two DSGRN databases for the same network. Since the L-systems can be thought of as perturbations (not necessarily small) of the switching systems, our results address the correspondence between global parameterized dynamics of switching systems and their perturbations. We show that, at corresponding parameters, there is an order preserving map from the Morse graph of the switching system to that of the L-system that is surjective on the set of attractors and bijective on the set of fixed point attractors. We provide important examples showing why this correspondence cannot be strengthened.;math.DS
1801.06539;Hom-center-symmetric algebras and bialgebras;In this work, the hom-center-symmetric algebras are constructed and discussed. Their bimodules, dual bimodules and matched pairs are defined. The relation between the dual bimodules of hom-center-symmetric algebras and the matched pairs of hom-Lie algebras is established. Furthermore, the Manin triple of hom-center-symmetric algebras is given. Finally, a theorem linking the matched pairs of hom-center-symmetric algebras, the hom-center-symmetric bialgebras and the matched pairs of sub-adjacent hom-Lie algebras is provided.;math.RA
1801.06542;Further study on the maximum number of bent components of vectorial functions;In 2018, Pott, at al. have studied in [IEEE Transactions on Information Theory. Volume: 64, Issue: 1, 2018] the maximum number of bent components of vectorial function. They have presented serval nice results and suggested several open problems in this context. This paper is in the continuation of their study in which we solve two open problems raised by Pott et al. and partially solve an open problem raised by the same authors. Firstly, we prove that for a vectorial function, the property of having the maximum number of bent components is invariant under the so-called CCZ equivalence. Secondly, we prove the non-existence of APN plateaued having the maximum number of bent components. In particular, quadratic APN functions cannot have the maximum number of bent components. Finally, we present some sufficient conditions that the vectorial function defined from $\mathbb{F}_{2^{2k}}$ to $\mathbb{F}_{2^{2k}}$ by its univariate representation: <br />$$ \alpha x^{2^i}\left(x+x^{2^k}+\sum\limits_{j=1}^{\rho}\gamma^{(j)}x^{2^{t_j}} <br />+\sum\limits_{j=1}^{\rho}\gamma^{(j)}x^{2^{t_j+k}}\right)$$ has the maximum number of {components bent functions, where $\rho\leq k$}. Further, we show that the differential spectrum of the function $ x^{2^i}(x+x^{2^k}+x^{2^{t_1}}+x^{2^{t_1+k}}+x^{2^{t_2}}+x^{2^{t_2+k}})$ (where $i,t_1,t_2$ satisfy some conditions) is different from the binomial function $F^i(x)= x^{2^i}(x+x^{2^k})$ presented in the article of Pott et al. <br />Finally, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions so that the functions $$Tr_1^{2k}\left(\alpha x^{2^i}\left(Tr^{2k}_{e}(x)+\sum\limits_{j=1}^{\rho}\gamma^{(j)}(Tr^{2k}_{e}(x))^{2^j} <br />\right)\right) $$ are bent.;cs.IT
1801.06553;Reduced basis approximation and a posteriori error estimation: applications to elasticity problems in several parametric settings;In this work we consider (hierarchical, Lagrange) reduced basis approximation and a posteriori error estimation for elasticity problems in affinley parametrized geometries. The essential ingredients of the methodology are: a Galerkin projection onto a low-dimensional space associated with a smooth "parametric manifold" - dimension reduction, an efficient and effective greedy sampling methods for identification of optimal and numerically stable approximations - rapid convergence, an a posteriori error estimation procedures - rigorous and sharp bounds for the functional outputs related with the underlying solution or related quantities of interest, like stress intensity factor, and Offline-Online computational decomposition strategies - minimum marginal cost for high performance in the real-time and many-query (e.g., design and optimization) contexts. We present several illustrative results for linear elasticity problem in parametrized geometries representing 2D Cartesian or 3D axisymmetric configurations like an arc-cantilever beam, a center crack problem, a composite unit cell or a woven composite beam, a multi-material plate, and a closed vessel. We consider different parametrization for the systems: either physical quantities - to model the materials and loads - and geometrical parameters - to model different geometrical configurations - with isotropic and orthotropic materials working in plane stress and plane strain approximation. We would like to underline the versatility of the methodology in very different problems. As last example we provide a nonlinear setting with increased complexity.;math.NA
1801.06555;A theorem of Tits type for automorphism groups of projective varieties in arbitrary characteristic (with an appendix by Tomohide Terasoma);We prove a theorem of Tits type for automorphism groups of projective varieties over an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic, which was first conjectured by Keum, Oguiso and Zhang for complex projective varieties.;math.AG
1801.06563;A note on the knot Floer homology of fibered knots;We prove that the knot Floer homology of a fibered knot is nontrivial in its next-to-top Alexander grading. Immediate applications include new proofs of Krcatovich's result that knots with $L$-space surgeries are prime and Hedden and Watson's result that the rank of knot Floer homology detects the trefoil among knots in the 3--sphere. We also generalize the latter result, proving a similar theorem for nullhomologous knots in any 3--manifold. We note that our method of proof inspired Baldwin and Sivek's recent proof that Khovanov homology detects the trefoils. As part of this work, we also introduce a numerical refinement of the Ozsv\'ath-Szab\'o contact invariant. This refinement was the inspiration for Hubbard and Saltz's annular refinement of Plamenevskaya's transverse link invariant in Khovanov homology.;math.GT
1801.06566;Model Theory and Machine Learning;About 25 years ago, it came to light that a single combinatorial property determines both an important dividing line in model theory (NIP) and machine learning (PAC-learnability). The following years saw a fruitful exchange of ideas between PAC learning and the model theory of NIP structures. In this article, we point out a new and similar connection between model theory and machine learning, this time developing a correspondence between \emph{stability} and learnability in various settings of \emph{online learning.} In particular, this gives many new examples of mathematically interesting classes which are learnable in the online setting.;math.LO
1801.06567;Smooth Exact Penalty Functions: A General Approach;In this article we present a new perspective on the smooth exact penalty function proposed by Huyer and Neumaier that is becoming more and more popular tool for solving constrained optimization problems. Our approach to Huyer and Neumaier's exact penalty function allows one to apply previously unused tools (namely, parametric optimization) to the study of the exactness of this function. We give a new simple proof of the local exactness of Huyer and Neumair's penalty function that significantly generalizes all similar results existing in the literature. We also obtain new necessary and sufficient conditions for the global exactness of this penalty function.;math.OC
1801.06569;Observer-based boundary control of the sine-Gordon model energy;In this paper the output feedback energy control problem for the sine-Gordon model is studied. An observer for the sine-Gordon equation and a speed-gradient boundary control law for solving this problem are analysed. Explicit inequalities on system's parameters ensuring the exponential decay of the estimation error are obtained. Under an additional assumption the achievement of the control goal is proved. The results of numerical experiments demonstrate that the transient time in energy is close to the transient time in observation error.;math.OC
1801.06570;Joint estimation of parameters in Ising model;We study joint estimation of the inverse temperature and magnetization parameters $(\beta,B)$ of an Ising model with a non-negative coupling matrix $A_n$ of size $n\times n$, given one sample from the Ising model. We give a general bound on the rate of consistency of the bi-variate pseudolikelihood estimator. Using this, we show that estimation at rate $n^{-1/2}$ is always possible if $A_n$ is the adjacency matrix of a bounded degree graph. If $A_n$ is the scaled adjacency matrix of a graph whose average degree goes to $+\infty$, the situation is a bit more delicate. In this case estimation at rate $n^{-1/2}$ is still possible if the graph is not regular (in an asymptotic sense). Finally, we show that consistent estimation of both parameters is impossible if the graph is Erd\"os-Renyi with parameter $p&gt,0$ free of $n$, thus confirming that estimation is harder on approximately regular graphs with large degree.;math.ST
1801.06572;A Local Trace Formula for the Generalized Shalika Model;We study local multiplicities associated to the so-called generalized Shalika models. By establishing a local trace formula for these kind of models, we are able to prove a multiplicity formula for discrete series. As a result, we can show that these multiplicities are constant over every discrete Vogan $L$-packet and that they are related to local exterior square $L$-functions.;math.RT
1801.06576;A metric deformation on fiber bundles and applications;We develop the concept of a Cheeger deformation on the context of fiber bundles with compact structure group. This procedure is used to provide metrics with positive Ricci curvature on the total space of such bundles, generalizing the results in Nash \cite{nash1979positive} and Poor \cite{poor1975some}.;math.DG
1801.06580;A Fully-Distributed Asynchronous Approach for Multi-Area Coordinated Network-Constrained Unit Commitment;This paper discusses a consensus-based alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach to solve the multi-area coordinated network-constrained unit commitment (NCUC) problem in a distributed manner. Due to political and technical difficulties, it is neither practical nor feasible to solve the multi-area coordination problem in a centralized fashion, which requires full access to all data of individual areas. In comparison, in the proposed fully-distributed approach, local NCUC problems of individual areas can be solved independently, and only limited information is exchanged among adjacent areas for facilitating multi-area coordination. Furthermore, as traditional ADMM can only guarantee convergence for convex problems, this paper discusses several strategies to mitigate oscillations, enhance convergence performance, and derive good-enough feasible solutions, including: (i) A tie-line power flow based area coordination strategy is designed to reduce the number of global consensus variables, (ii) Different penalty parameters \r{ho} are assigned to individual consensus variables and are updated via certain rules during the iterative procedure, which would reduce the impact of initial values of \r{ho} on convergence performance, (iii) Heuristic rules are adopted to fix certain unit commitment variables for avoiding oscillations during the iterative procedure, and (iv) An asynchronous distributed strategy is studied, which solves NCUC subproblems of small areas multiple times and exchanges information with adjacent areas more frequently within one complete run of slower NCUC subproblems of large areas. Numerical cases illustrate effectiveness of the proposed asynchronous fully-distributed NCUC approach, and investigate key factors that would affect its convergence performance.;math.OC
1801.06581;A Smeary Central Limit Theorem for Manifolds with Application to High Dimensional Spheres;The (CLT) central limit theorems for generalized Frechet means (data descriptors assuming values in stratified spaces, such as intrinsic means, geodesics, etc.) on manifolds from the literature are only valid if a certain empirical process of Hessians of the Frechet function converges suitably, as in the proof of the prototypical BP-CLT (Bhattacharya and Patrangenaru (2005)). This is not valid in many realistic scenarios and we provide for a new very general CLT. In particular this includes scenarios where, in a suitable chart, the sample mean fluctuates asymptotically at a scale $n^{\alpha}$ with exponents ${\alpha} &lt, 1/2$ with a non-normal distribution. As the BP-CLT yields only fluctuations that are, rescaled with $n^{1/2}$ , asymptotically normal, just as the classical CLT for random vectors, these lower rates, somewhat loosely called smeariness, had to date been observed only on the circle (Hotz and Huckemann (2015)). We make the concept of smeariness on manifolds precise, give an example for two-smeariness on spheres of arbitrary dimension, and show that smeariness, although "almost never" occurring, may have serious statistical implications on a continuum of sample scenarios nearby. In fact, this effect increases with dimension, striking in particular in high dimension low sample size scenarios.;math.ST
1801.06585;On two types of $Z$-monodromy in triangulations of surfaces;Let $\Gamma$ be a triangulation of a connected closed $2$-dimensional (not necessarily orientable) surface. Using zigzags (closed left-right paths), for every face of $\Gamma$ we define the $z$-monodromy which acts on the oriented edges of this face. There are precisely $7$ types of $z$-monodromies. We consider the following two cases: (M1) the $z$-monodromy is identity, (M2) the $z$-monodromy is the consecutive passing of the oriented edges. Our main result is the following: the subgraphs of the dual graph $\Gamma^{*}$ formed by edges whose $z$-monodromies are of types (M1) and (M2), respectively, both are forests. We apply this statement to the connected sum of $z$-knotted triangulations.;math.CO
1801.06589;A finite element method for the surface Stokes problem;We consider a Stokes problem posed on a 2D surface embedded in a 3D domain. The equations describe an equilibrium, area-preserving tangential flow of a viscous surface fluid and serve as a model problem in the dynamics of material interfaces. In this paper, we develop and analyze a Trace finite element method (TraceFEM) for such a surface Stokes problem. TraceFEM relies on finite element spaces defined on a fixed, surface-independent background mesh which consists of shape-regular tetrahedra. Thus, there is no need for surface parametrization or surface fitting with the mesh. The TraceFEM treated here is based on $P_1$ bulk finite elements for both the velocity and the pressure. In order to enforce the velocity vector field to be tangential to the surface we introduce a penalty term. The method is straightforward to implement and has an $O(h^2)$ geometric consistency error, which is of the same order as the approximation error due to the $P_1$--$P_1$ pair for velocity and pressure. We prove stability and optimal order discretization error bounds in the surface $H^1$ and $L^2$ norms. A series of numerical experiments is presented to illustrate certain features of the proposed TraceFEM.;math.NA
1801.06590;Persistent Homology of Morse Decompositions in Combinatorial Dynamics;We investigate combinatorial dynamical systems on simplicial complexes considered as {\em finite topological spaces}. Such systems arise in a natural way from sampling dynamics and may be used to reconstruct some features of the dynamics directly from the sample. We study the homological persistence of {\em Morse decompositions} of such systems, an important descriptor of the dynamics, as a tool for validating the reconstruction. Our framework can be viewed as a step toward extending the classical persistence theory to "vector cloud" data. We present experimental results on two numerical examples.;math.AT
1801.06592;A divergence-free semi-implicit finite volume scheme for ideal, viscous and resistive magnetohydrodynamics;In this paper we present a novel pressure-based semi-implicit finite volume solver for the equations of compressible ideal, viscous and resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The new method is conservative for mass, momentum and total energy and in multiple space dimensions it is constructed in such a way as to respect the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field exactly, also in the presence of resistive effects. This is possible via the use of multi-dimensional Riemann solvers on an appropriately staggered grid for the time evolution of the magnetic field and a double curl formulation of the resistive terms. The new semi-implicit method for the MHD equations proposed here discretizes all terms related to the pressure in the momentum equation and the total energy equation implicitly, making again use of a properly staggered grid for pressure and velocity. The time step of the scheme is restricted by a CFL condition based only on the fluid velocity and the Alfv\'en wave speed and is not based on the speed of the magnetosonic waves. Our new method is particularly well-suited for low Mach number flows and for the incompressible limit of the MHD equations, for which it is well-known that explicit density-based Godunov-type finite volume solvers become increasingly inefficient and inaccurate due to the increasingly stringent CFL condition and the wrong scaling of the numerical viscosity in the incompressible limit. We show a relevant MHD test problem in the low Mach number regime where the new semi-implicit algorithm is a factor of 50 faster than a traditional explicit finite volume method, which is a very significant gain in terms of computational efficiency. However, our numerical results confirm that our new method performs well also for classical MHD test cases with strong shocks. In this sense our new scheme is a true all Mach number flow solver.;math.NA
1801.06609;A Precise Analysis of PhaseMax in Phase Retrieval;Recovering an unknown complex signal from the magnitude of linear combinations of the signal is referred to as phase retrieval. We present an exact performance analysis of a recently proposed convex-optimization-formulation for this problem, known as PhaseMax. Standard convex-relaxation-based methods in phase retrieval resort to the idea of "lifting" which makes them computationally inefficient, since the number of unknowns is effectively squared. In contrast, PhaseMax is a novel convex relaxation that does not increase the number of unknowns. Instead it relies on an initial estimate of the true signal which must be externally provided. In this paper, we investigate the required number of measurements for exact recovery of the signal in the large system limit and when the linear measurement matrix is random with iid standard normal entries. If $n$ denotes the dimension of the unknown complex signal and $m$ the number of phaseless measurements, then in the large system limit, $\frac{m}{n} &gt, \frac{4}{\cos^2(\theta)}$ measurements is necessary and sufficient to recover the signal with high probability, where $\theta$ is the angle between the initial estimate and the true signal. Our result indicates a sharp phase transition in the asymptotic regime which matches the empirical result in numerical simulations.;cs.IT
1801.06612;Scattering for Defocusing generalized Benjamin-Ono Equation in the Energy Space;We prove the scattering for the defocusing generalized Benjamin-Ono equation in the energy space $H^{\frac{1}{2}}(\mathbb{R})$. We first establish the monotonicity formula that describes the unidirectional propagation. More precisely, it says that the center of energy moves faster than the center of mass. This type of monotonicity was first observed by Tao (DCDS 2007) in the defocusing gKdV equations. <br />We use the monotonicity in the setting of compactness-contradiction argument to prove the large data scattering in the energy space $H^{\frac{1}{2}}(\mathbb{R})$. On the way, we extend critical local theory of Vento (IMRN 2010) to the subcritical regime. Indeed, we obtain subcritical local theory and global well-posedness in the energy space.;math.AP
1801.06616;A two-dimensional rationality problem;Let $k$ be an infinite field such that char $k\neq 2$ and $k$ is not algebraically closed. Let $a\in k\setminus k^2$ and $L=k(\sqrt{a})(x,y)$ be a field extension of $k$ where $x,y$ are algebraically independent over $k$. Assume that $\sigma$ is a $k$-automorphism on $L$ defined by \[ \sigma: \sqrt{a}\mapsto -\sqrt{a},\ x\mapsto \frac{b}{x},\ y\mapsto \frac{c(x+\frac{b}{x})+d}{y} \] where $b,c,d \in k$, $b\neq 0$ and at least one of $c,d$ is non-zero. Theorem. Let $L^{\langle\sigma\rangle}=\{u\in L:\sigma(u)=u\}$ be the fixed subfield of $L$. Assume that $b \in k\setminus k^2$. Then the field $L^{\langle\sigma\rangle}$ is rational (resp. stably rational, unirational) over $k$ if and only if there exist $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta\in k$ such that $\alpha ^2-a \beta ^2=b$, $\gamma^2-a \delta ^2= 2c \alpha + d$. The same question when $b$ is a square in $k$ is solved also.;math.AG
1801.06618;Douglas--Rachford Splitting and ADMM for Pathological Convex Optimization;Despite the vast literature on DRS and ADMM, there has been very little work analyzing their behavior under pathologies. Most analyses assume a primal solution exists, a dual solution exists, and strong duality holds. When these assumptions are not met, i.e., under pathologies, the theory often breaks down and the empirical performance may degrade significantly. In this paper, we establish that DRS only requires strong duality to work, in the sense that asymptotically iterates are approximately feasible and approximately optimal.;math.OC
1801.06624;Double circulant self-dual and LCD codes over Galois rings;This paper investigates the existence, enumeration and asymptotic performance of self-dual and LCD double circulant codes over Galois rings of characteristic $p^2$ and order $p^4$ with $p$ and odd prime. When $p \equiv 3 \pmod{4},$ we give an algorithm to construct a duality preserving bijective Gray map from such a Galois ring to $\mathbb{Z}_{p^2}^2.$ Using random coding, we obtain families of asymptotically good self-dual and LCD codes over $\mathbb{Z}_{p^2},$ for the metric induced by the standard $\mathbb{F}_p$-valued Gray maps.;cs.IT

In this paper, we provide a weak limit theorem for the distribution of the nonlinear quantum walk. The proof is based on the scattering theory of the nonlinear quantum walk and the limit distribution is obtained in terms of its asymptotic state.;math-ph
1801.06627;Properties of Mean Value Sets: Angle Conditions, Blowup Solutions, and Nonconvexity;We study the mean values sets of the second order divergence form elliptic operator with principal coefficients defined as $$a^{ij}_k(x):= \begin{cases} \alpha_k \delta^{ij}(x) &amp,x_n&gt,0 \beta_k \delta^{ij}(x) &amp,x_n&lt,0. \end{cases}$$ In particular, we will show that the mean value sets associated to such an operator need not be convex as $\alpha_k$ and $\beta_k$ converge to 1. This example then leads to an example of nonconvex mean value sets for smooth $a^{ij}(x)$.;math.AP
1801.06631;Hessian Geometry and Phase Changes of Multi-Taub-NUT Metrics;We study the Hessian geometry of toric multi-Taub-NUT metrics and their phase change phenomena via the images of their moment maps. This generalizes an earlier paper on toric Gibbons-Hawking metrics.;math.DG
1801.06633;Analytic Approach To a Generalization of Chern Classes in Supergeometry;Some cohomology elements, called $\nu$ classes, as a supergeneralization of universal Chern classes, are introduced for canonical super line bundles over $\nu$ projective spaces, a novel supergeometric generalization of projective spaces. It is shown that these classes may be described by analytic representatives of elements of generalized de Rham cohomology.;math.DG
1801.06634;Joint CLT for eigenvalue statistics from several dependent large dimensional sample covariance matrices with application;Let $\mathbf{X}_n=(x_{ij})$ be a $k \times n$ data matrix with complex-valued, independent and standardized entries satisfying a Lindeberg-type moment condition. We consider simultaneously $R$ sample covariance matrices $\mathbf{B}_{nr}=\frac1n \mathbf{Q}_r \mathbf{X}_n \mathbf{X}_n^*\mathbf{Q}_r^\top,~1\le r\le R$, where the $\mathbf{Q}_{r}$'s are nonrandom real matrices with common dimensions $p\times k~(k\geq p)$. Assuming that both the dimension $p$ and the sample size $n$ grow to infinity, the limiting distributions of the eigenvalues of the matrices $\{\mathbf{B}_{nr}\}$ are identified, and as the main result of the paper, we establish a joint central limit theorem for linear spectral statistics of the $R$ matrices $\{\mathbf{B}_{nr}\}$. Next, this new CLT is applied to the problem of testing a high dimensional white noise in time series modelling. In experiments the derived test has a controlled size and is significantly faster than the classical permutation test, though it does have lower power. This application highlights the necessity of such joint CLT in the presence of several dependent sample covariance matrices. In contrast, all the existing works on CLT for linear spectral statistics of large sample covariance matrices deal with a single sample covariance matrix ($R=1$).;math.ST
1801.06636;On the geometrical properties of the coherent matching distance in 2D persistent homology;In this paper we study a new metric for comparing Betti numbers functions in bidimensional persistent homology, based on coherent matchings, i.e. families of matchings that vary in a continuous way. We prove some new results about this metric, including its stability. In particular, we show that the computation of this distance is strongly related to suitable filtering functions associated with lines of slope 1, so underlining the key role of these lines in the study of bidimensional persistence. In order to prove these results, we introduce and study the concepts of extended Pareto grid for a normal filtering function as well as of transport of a matching. As a by-product, we obtain a theoretical framework for managing the phenomenon of monodromy in 2D persistent homology.;math.AT
1801.06638;An upper bound on the asymptotic translation lengths on the curve graph and fibered faces;We study the asymptotic behavior of the asymptotic translation lengths on the curve complexes of pseudo-Anosov monodromies in a fibered cone of a fibered hyperbolic 3-manifold $M$ with $b_1(M) \geq 2$. For a sequence $(\Sigma_n, \psi_n)$ of fibers and monodromies in the fibered cone, we show that the asymptotic translation length on the curve complex is bounded above by $1/\chi(\Sigma_n)^{1+1/r}$ as long as their projections to the fibered face converge to a point in the interior, where $r$ is the dimension of the $\psi_n$-invariant homology of $\Sigma_n$ (which is independent of $n$). As a corollary, if $b_1(M) = 2$, the asymptotic translation length on the curve complex of such a sequence of primitive elements behaves like $1/\chi(\Sigma_n)^{2}$. Furthermore, together with a work of E. Hironaka, our theorem can be used to determine the asymptotic behavior of the minimal translation lengths of handlebody mapping class groups and the set of mapping classes with homological dilatation one.;math.GT
1801.06646;Mann Iteration Process for Monotone Nonexpansive Mappings with a Graph;Let $(X,\|.\|)$ be a Banach space. Let $C$ be a nonempty, bounded, closed, and convex subset of $X$ and $T: C \rightarrow C$ be a $G$-monotone nonexpansive mapping. In this work, it is shown that the Mann iteration sequence defined by $$x_{n+1} = t_n T(x_n) + (1-t_n)x_n, \, n = 1, 2, \cdots$$ can be proved the existence of a fixed point of $G$-monotone nonexpansive mappings.;math.FA
1801.06647;Epimorphisms, definability and cardinalities;Generalizing a theorem of Campercholi, we characterize, in syntactic terms, the ranges of epimorphisms in an arbitrary class of similar first-order structures (as opposed to an elementary class). This allows us to strengthen a result of Isbell, as follows: in any prevariety having at most s non-logical symbols and an axiomatization requiring at most m variables, if the epimorphisms into structures with at most m + s + aleph0 elements are surjective, then so are all of the epimorphisms. Using these facts, we formulate and prove manageable "bridge theorems", matching the surjectivity of all epimorphisms in the algebraic counterpart of a logic L with suitable infinitary definability properties of L, while not making the standard but awkward assumption that L comes furnished with a proper class of variables.;math.LO
1801.06650;Varieties of De Morgan monoids: minimality and irreducible algebras;It is proved that every finitely subdirectly irreducible De Morgan monoid A (with neutral element e) is either (i) a Sugihara chain in which e covers not(e) or (ii) the union of an interval subalgebra [not(a), a] and two chains of idempotents, (not(a)] and [a), where a = (not(e))^2. In the latter case, the variety generated by [not(a), a] has no nontrivial idempotent member, and A/[not(a)) is a Sugihara chain in which not(e) = e. It is also proved that there are just four minimal varieties of De Morgan monoids. This theorem is then used to simplify the proof of a description (due to K. Swirydowicz) of the lower part of the subvariety lattice of relevant algebras. The results throw light on the models and the axiomatic extensions of fundamental relevance logics.;math.LO
1801.06654;Varieties of De Morgan monoids: covers of atoms;The variety DMM of De Morgan monoids has just four minimal subvarieties. The join-irreducible covers of these atoms in the subvariety lattice of DMM are investigated. One of the two atoms consisting of idempotent algebras has no such cover, the other has just one. The remaining two atoms lack nontrivial idempotent members. They are generated, respectively, by 4-element De Morgan monoids C4 and D4, where C4 is the only nontrivial 0-generated algebra onto which finitely subdirectly irreducible De Morgan monoids may be mapped by non-injective homomorphisms. The homomorphic pre-images of C4 within DMM (together with the trivial De Morgan monoids) constitute a proper quasivariety, which is shown to have a largest subvariety U. The covers of the variety V(C4) within U are revealed here. There are just ten of them (all finitely generated). In exactly six of these ten varieties, all nontrivial members have C4 as a retract. In the varietal join of those six classes, every subquasivariety is a variety-in fact, every finite subdirectly irreducible algebra is projective. Beyond U, all covers of V(C4) [or of V(D4)] within DMM are discriminator varieties. Of these, we identify infinitely many that are finitely generated, and some that are not. We also prove that there are just 68 minimal quasivarieties of De Morgan monoids.;math.LO
1801.06659;On positive solutions of fully nonlinear degenerate Lane-Emden type equations;We prove existence and uniqueness results of positive viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear degenerate elliptic equations with power-like zero order perturbations in bounded domains. The principal part of such equations is either $\mathcal{P}^-_{k}(D^2u)$ or $\mathcal{P}^+_{k}(D^2u)$, some sort of \lq\lq truncated Laplacians\rq\rq, given respectively by the smallest and the largest partial sum of $k$ eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. New phenomena with respect to the semilinear case occur. Moreover, for $\mathcal{P}^-_{k}$, we explicitely find the critical exponent $p$ of the power nonlinearity that separates the existence and nonexistence range of nontrivial solutions with zero Dirichlet boundary condition.;math.AP
1801.06666;HDG-NEFEM with degree adaptivity for Stokes flows;The NURBS-enhanced finite element method (NEFEM) combined with a hybridisable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) approach is presented for the first time. The proposed technique completely eliminates the uncertainty induced by a polynomial approximation of curved boundaries that is common within an isoparametric approach and, compared to other DG methods, provides a significant reduction in number of degrees of freedom. In addition, by exploiting the ability of HDG to compute a postprocessed solution and by using a local a priori error estimate valid for elliptic problems, an inexpensive, reliable and computable error estimator is devised. The proposed methodology is used to solve Stokes flow problems using automatic degree adaptation. Particular attention is paid to the importance of an accurate boundary representation when changing the degree of approximation in curved elements. Several strategies are compared and the superiority and reliability of HDG-NEFEM with degree adaptation is illustrated.;math.NA
1801.06669;A frequency domain analysis of the error distribution from noisy high-frequency data;Data observed at high sampling frequency are typically assumed to be an additive composite of a relatively slow-varying continuous-time component, a latent stochastic process or a smooth random function, and measurement error. Supposing that the latent component is an It\^{o} diffusion process, we propose to estimate the measurement error density function by applying a deconvolution technique with appropriate localization. Our estimator, which does not require equally-spaced observed times, is consistent and minimax rate optimal. We also investigate estimators of the moments of the error distribution and their properties, propose a frequency domain estimator for the integrated volatility of the underlying stochastic process, and show that it achieves the optimal convergence rate. Simulations and a real data analysis validate our analysis.;math.ST
1801.06674;On the automorphism group of a closed G$_2$-structure;We study the automorphism group of a compact 7-manifold $M$ endowed with a closed non-parallel G$_2$-structure, showing that its identity component is abelian with dimension bounded by min$\{6,b_2(M)\}$. This implies the non-existence of compact homogeneous manifolds endowed with an invariant closed non-parallel G$_2$-structure. We also discuss some relevant examples.;math.DG
1801.06676;Higher genera for proper actions of Lie groups;Let G be a Lie group with finitely many connected components and let K be a maximal compact subgroup. We assume that G satisfies the rapid decay (RD) property and that G/K has non-positive sectional curvature. As an example, we can take G to be a connected semisimple Lie group. Let M be a G-proper manifold with compact quotient M/G. In this paper we establish index formulae for the C^*-higher indices of a G-equivariant Dirac-type operator on M. We use these formulae to investigate geometric properties of suitably defined higher genera on M. In particular, we establish the G-homotopy invariance of the higher signatures of a G-proper manifold and the vanishing of the A-hat genera of a G-spin, G-proper manifold admitting a G-invariant metric of positive scalar curvature.;math.KT
1801.06677;Nonfractional Memory: Filtering, Antipersistence, and Forecasting;The fractional difference operator remains to be the most popular mechanism to generate long memory due to the existence of efficient algorithms for their simulation and forecasting. Nonetheless, there is no theoretical argument linking the fractional difference operator with the presence of long memory in real data. In this regard, one of the most predominant theoretical explanations for the presence of long memory is cross-sectional aggregation of persistent micro units. Yet, the type of processes obtained by cross-sectional aggregation differs from the one due to fractional differencing. Thus, this paper develops fast algorithms to generate and forecast long memory by cross-sectional aggregation. Moreover, it is shown that the antipersistent phenomenon that arises for negative degrees of memory in the fractional difference literature is not present for cross-sectionally aggregated processes. Pointedly, while the autocorrelations for the fractional difference operator are negative for negative degrees of memory by construction, this restriction does not apply to the cross-sectional aggregated scheme. We show that this has implications for long memory tests in the frequency domain, which will be misspecified for cross-sectionally aggregated processes with negative degrees of memory. Finally, we assess the forecast performance of high-order $AR$ and $ARFIMA$ models when the long memory series are generated by cross-sectional aggregation. Our results are of interest to practitioners developing forecasts of long memory variables like inflation, volatility, and climate data, where aggregation may be the source of long memory.;math.ST
1801.06679;Riding on the Primary: A New Spectrum Sharing Paradigm for Wireless-Powered IoT Devices;In this paper, a new spectrum sharing model referred to as riding on the primary (ROP) is proposed for wireless-powered IoT devices with ambient backscatter communication capabilities. The key idea of ROP is that the secondary transmitter harvests energy from the primary signal, then modulates its information bits to the primary signal, and reflects the modulated signal to the secondary receiver without violating the primary system's interference requirement. Compared with the conventional spectrum sharing model, the secondary system in the proposed ROP not only utilizes the spectrum of the primary system but also takes advantage of the primary signal to harvest energy and to carry its information. In this paper, we investigate the performance of such a spectrum sharing system under fading channels. To be specific, we maximize the ergodic capacity of the secondary system by jointly optimizing the transmit power of the primary signal and the reflection coefficient of the secondary ambient backscatter. Different (ideal/practical) energy consumption models, different (peak/average) transmit power constraints, different types (fixed/dynamically adjustable) reflection coefficient, different primary system's interference requirements (rate/outage) are considered. Optimal power allocation and reflection coefficient are obtained for each scenario.;cs.IT

We find the explicit formulas for the reproducing measure for these states. Examples of some applications of the obtained results in non-linear quantum optics are presented.;math-ph

1801.06682;Securing UAV Communications via Joint Trajectory and Power Control;Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is anticipated to be widely applied in the forthcoming fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks, due to its many advantages such as low cost, high mobility, and on-demand deployment. However, the broadcast and line-of-sight (LoS) nature of air-to-ground wireless channels gives rise to a new challenge on how to realize secure UAV communications with the destined nodes on the ground. This paper aims to tackle this challenge by applying the physical layer security technique. We consider both the downlink and uplink UAV communications with a ground node, namely UAV-to-ground (U2G) and ground-to-UAV (G2U) communications, respectively, subject to a potential eavesdropper on the ground. In contrast to the existing literature on wireless physical layer security only with ground nodes at fixed or quasi-static locations, we exploit the high mobility of the UAV to proactively establish favorable and degraded channels for the legitimate and eavesdropping links, respectively, via its trajectory design. We formulate new problems to maximize the average secrecy rates of the U2G and G2U transmissions, respectively, by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and the transmit power of the legitimate transmitter over a given flight period of the UAV. Although the formulated problems are non-convex, we propose iterative algorithms to solve them efficiently by applying the block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization methods. Specifically, the transmit power and UAV trajectory are each optimized with the other being fixed in an alternating manner, until the algorithms converge. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can improve the secrecy rates for both U2G and G2U communications, as compared to other benchmark schemes without power control and/or trajectory optimization.;cs.IT
1801.06684;Exponential ergodicity of some Markov dynamical system with application to a Poisson driven stochastic differential equation;We are concerned with the asymptotics of the Markov chain given by the post-jump locations of a certain piecewise-deterministic Markov process with a state-dependent jump intensity. We provide sufficient conditions for such a model to possess a unique invariant distribution, which is exponentially attracting in the dual bounded Lipschitz distance. Having established this, we generalise a result of J. Kazak on the jump process defined by a Poisson driven stochastic differential equation with a solution-dependent intensity of perturbations.;math.PR

This algorithm is based on an infinite version of the Robinson-Schensted algorithm.;math.RT
1801.06693;Real-time photoacoustic projection imaging using deep learning;Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is an emerging and non-invasive hybrid imaging modality for visualizing light absorbing structures in biological tissue. The recently invented PAT systems using arrays of 64 parallel integrating line detectors allow capturing photoacoustic projection images in fractions of a second. Standard image formation algorithms for this type of setup suffer from under-sampling due to the sparse detector array, blurring due to the finite impulse response of the detection system, and artifacts due to the limited detection view. To address these issues, in this paper we develop a new direct and non-iterative image reconstruction framework using deep learning. The proposed DALnet combines the universal backprojection (UBP) using dynamic aperture length (DAL) correction with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Both subnetworks contain free parameters that are adjusted in the training phase. As demonstrated by simulation and experiment, the DALnet is capable of producing high-resolution projection images of 3D structures at a frame rate of over 50 images per second on a standard PC with NVIDIA TITAN Xp GPU. The proposed network is shown to outperform state-of-the-art iterative total variation reconstruction algorithms in terms of reconstruction speed as well as in terms of various evaluation metrics.;math.NA

We obtain the existence of martingale solutions. The construction of the solution is based on the classical Galerkin approximation method, stopping time, the compactness method and the Jakubowski-Skorokhod theorem.;math.AP
1801.06701;On the $\infty$-stack of complexes over a scheme;We study fppf descent for enhanced derived categories. We revisit the work of [HS] and [TV08] in a lax context. More precisely, we construct a Cartesian and coCartesian fibration ${}^{\mathrm{op}}\mathscr D^+_S\rightarrow N(\mathop{\mathrm{Sch}}_S)$ whose fibre over an $S$-scheme $T$ is the opposite $\mathscr D^+(T)^{\mathrm{op}}$ of the quasicategory of bounded below complexes of $\mathscr O_T$-modules. We show that this fibration satisfies fppf-descent for schemes.;math.AG
1801.06702;Secrecy Capacity of Colored Gaussian Noise Channels with Feedback;In this paper, the k-th order autoregressive moving average (ARMA(k)) Gaussian wiretap channel with noiseless causal feedback is considered, in which an eavesdropper receives noisy observations of the signals in both forward and feedback channels. It is shown that a variant of the generalized Schalkwijk-Kailath scheme, a capacity-achieving coding scheme for the feedback Gaussian channel, achieves the same maximum rate for the same channel with the presence of an eavesdropper. Therefore, the secrecy capacity is equal to the feedback capacity without the presence of an eavesdropper for the feedback channel. Furthermore, the results are extended to the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with quantized feedback. It is shown that the proposed coding scheme achieves a positive secrecy rate. As the amplitude of the quantization noise decreases to zero, the secrecy rate converges to the capacity of the AWGN channel.;cs.IT
1801.06705;On closed Lie ideals of certain tensor products of C*-algebras II;We identify all closed Lie ideals of $A \otimes^{\alpha} B$ and $B(H) \otimes^{\alpha} B(H)$, where $\otimes^{\alpha}$ is either the Haagerup tensor product, the Banach space projective tensor product or the operator space projective tensor product, $A$ is any simple C*-algebra, $B$ is any C*-algebra with one of them admitting no tracial states, and $H$ is an infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space. Further, generalizing a result of Marcoux, we also identify all closed Lie ideals of $A\otimes^{\min} B$, where $A$ is a simple C*-algebra with at most one tracial state and $B$ is any commutative C*-algebra.;math.OA
1801.06709;Vector valued Hardy spaces;The Hardy space $H^{p}$ of vector valued analytic functions in tube domains in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ and with values in Banach space are defined. Vector valued analytic functions in tube domains in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ with values in Hilbert space and which have vector valued tempered distributions as boundary value are proved to be in $H^{p}$ corresponding to Hilbert space if the boundary value is in $L^{p}$ with values in Hilbert space. A Poisson integral representation for such vector valued analytic functions is obtained.;math.FA
1801.06718;Analog-to-Digital Compression: A New Paradigm for Converting Signals to Bits;Processing, storing and communicating information that originates as an analog signal involves conversion of this information to bits. This conversion can be described by the combined effect of sampling and quantization, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The digital representation is achieved by first sampling the analog signal so as to represent it by a set of discrete-time samples and then quantizing these samples to a finite number of bits. Traditionally, these two operations are considered separately. The sampler is designed to minimize information loss due to sampling based on characteristics of the continuous-time input. The quantizer is designed to represent the samples as accurately as possible, subject to a constraint on the number of bits that can be used in the representation. The goal of this article is to revisit this paradigm by illuminating the dependency between these two operations. In particular, we explore the requirements on the sampling system subject to constraints on the available number of bits for storing, communicating or processing the analog information.;cs.IT
1801.06721;On the unicity of types for tame toral supercuspidal representations;For tame arbitrary-length toral, also called positive regular, supercuspidal representations of a simply connected and semisimple $p$-adic group $G$, constructed as per Adler-Yu, we determine which components of their restriction to a maximal compact subgroup are types. We give conditions under which there is a unique such component, and then present a class of examples for which there is not, disproving the strong version of the conjecture of unicity of types on maximal compact open subgroups. We restate the unicity conjecture, and prove it holds for the groups and representations under consideration under a mild condition on depth.;math.RT
1801.06725;A Comparison Framework for Interleaved Persistence Modules;We present a generalization of the induced matching theorem and use it to prove a generalization of the algebraic stability theorem for $\mathbb{R}$-indexed pointwise finite-dimensional persistence modules. Via numerous examples, we show how the generalized algebraic stability theorem enables the computation of rigorous error bounds in the space of persistence diagrams that go beyond the typical formulation in terms of bottleneck (or log bottleneck) distance.;math.AT
1801.06731;Regularity and Gr&#xf6,bner bases of the Rees algebra of edge ideals of bipartite graphs;Let $G$ be a bipartite graph and $I=I(G)$ be its edge ideal. The aim of this note is to investigate different aspects of the Rees algebra $\mathcal{R}(I)$ of $I$. We compute its regularity and the universal Gr\"obner basis of its defining equations, interestingly, both of them are described in terms of the combinatorics of $G$. We apply these ideas to study the regularity of the powers of $I$. For any $s \ge \text{match}(G)+\lvert E(G) \rvert +1$ we prove that $\text{reg}(I^{s+1})=\text{reg}(I^s)+2$.;math.AC
1801.06735;Long time dynamics for weakly damped nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations;We continue our study of damped nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations. In our previous work we considered fixed positive damping and proved a form of the soliton resolution conjecture for radial solutions. In contrast, here we consider damping which decreases in time to 0. In the class of radial data we again establish soliton resolution provided the damping goes to 0 sufficiently slowly. While our previous work relied on invariant manifold theory, here we use the Lojasiewicz-Simon inequality applied to a suitable Lyapunov functional.;math.AP
1801.06736;On the Construction of Quasi-Binary and Quasi-Orthogonal Matrices over Finite Fields;Orthogonal and quasi-orthogonal matrices have a long history of use in digital image processing, digital and wireless communications, cryptography and many other areas of computer science and coding theory. The practical benefits of using orthogonal matrices come from the fact that the computation of inverse matrices is avoided, by simply using the transpose of the orthogonal matrix. In this paper, we introduce a new family of matrices over finite fields that we call \emph{Quasi-Binary and Quasi-Orthogonal Matrices}. We call the matrices quasi-binary due to the fact that matrices have only two elements $a, b \in \mathbb{F}_q$, but those elements are not $0$ and $1$. In addition, the reason why we call them quasi-orthogonal is due to the fact that their inverses are obtained not just by a simple transposition, but there is a need for an additional operation: a replacement of $a$ and $b$ by two other values $c$ and $d$. We give a simple relation between the values $a, b, c$ and $d$ for any finite field and especially for finite fields with characteristic 2. Our construction is based on incident matrices from cyclic Latin Rectangles and the efficiency of the proposed algorithm comes from the avoidance of matrix-matrix or matrix-vector multiplications.;cs.IT
1801.06737;At What Frequency Should the Kelly Bettor Bet?;We study the problem of optimizing the betting frequency in a dynamic game setting using Kelly's celebrated expected logarithmic growth criterion as the performance metric. The game is defined by a sequence of bets with independent and identically distributed returns X(k). The bettor selects the fraction of wealth K wagered at k = 0 and waits n steps before updating the bet size. Between updates, the proceeds from the previous bets remain at risk in the spirit of "buy and hold." Within this context, the main questions we consider are as follows: How does the optimal performance, we call it gn*, change with n? Does the high-frequency case, n = 1, always lead to the best performance? What are the effects of accrued interest and transaction costs? First, we provide rather complete answers to these questions for the important special case when X(k) in {-1,1} is a Bernoulli random variable with probability p that X(k) = 1. This serves as an entry point for future research using a binomial lattice model for stock trading. The latter sections focus on more general probability distributions for X(k) and two conjectures. The first conjecture is simple to state: Absent transaction costs, gn* is non-increasing in n. The second conjecture involves the technical condition which we call the sufficient attractiveness inequality. We first prove that satisfaction of this inequality is sufficient to guarantee that the low-frequency bettor using large n can match the performance of the high-frequency bettor using n = 1. Subsequently, we conjecture, and provide supporting evidence that this condition is also necessary.;math.OC
1801.06738;Two classes of finite groups whose Chermak-Delgado lattice is a chain of length zero;It is an open question in the study of Chermak-Delgado lattices precisely which finite groups $G$ have the property that $CD(G)$ is a chain of length $0$. In this note, we determine two classes of groups with this property. We prove that if $G=AB$ is a finite group, where $A$ and $B$ are abelian subgroups of relatively prime orders with $A$ normal in $G$, then the Chermak-Delgado lattice of $G$ equals $\{AC_B(A)\}$, a strengthening of earlier known results.;math.GR
1801.06744;Bilinear pseudo-differential operators with exotic symbols;The boundedness from $L^p \times L^q$ to $L^r$, $1&lt,p,q \le \infty$, $0&lt,1/p+1/q=1/r \le 1$, of bilinear pseudo-differential operators with symbols in the bilinear H\"ormander class $BS^m_{\rho,\rho}$, $0 \le \rho &lt,1$, is proved for the critical order $m$. Related results for the cases $p=1$, $q=1$ or $r=\infty$ are also obtained.;math.CA
1801.06745;Bilinear pseudo-differential operators with exotic symbols, II;The boundedness from $H^p \times L^2$ to $L^r$, $1/p+1/2=1/r$, and from $H^p \times L^{\infty}$ to $L^p$ of bilinear pseudo-differential operators is proved under the assumption that their symbols are in the bilinear H\"ormander class $BS^m_{\rho,\rho}$, $0 \le \rho &lt,1$, of critical order $m$, where $H^p$ is the Hardy space. This combined with the previous results of the same authors establishes the sharp boundedness from $H^p \times H^q$ to $L^r$, $1/p+1/q=1/r$, of those operators in the full range $0&lt, p, q \le \infty$, where $L^r$ is replaced by $BMO$ if $r=\infty$.;math.CA
1801.06747;Connectivity of cubical polytopes;A cubical polytope is a polytope with all its facets being combinatorially equivalent to cubes. We deal with the connectivity of the graphs of cubical polytopes. We first establish that, for any $d\ge 3$, the graph of a cubical $d$-polytope with minimum degree $\delta$ is $\min\{\delta,2d-2\}$-connected. Second, we show, for any $d\ge 4$, that every minimum separator of cardinality at most $2d-3$ in such a graph consists of all the neighbours of some vertex and that removing the vertices of the separator from the graph leaves exactly two components, with one of them being the vertex itself.;math.CO
1801.06749;A general approach to approximation theory of operator semigroups;We develop a general, functional calculus approach to approximation of $C_0$-semigroups on Banach spaces by bounded completely monotone functions of their generators. The approach comprises most of well-known approximation formulas, yields optimal convergence rates, and sometimes even leads to sharp constants. In an important particular case when semigroups are holomorphic, we are able to significantly improve our results for general semigroups. Moreover, we present several second order approximation formulas with rates, which in such a general form appear in the literature for the first time.;math.FA
1801.06751;A Tractable Approach for designing Piecewise Affine Policies in Two-stage Adjustable Robust Optimization;We consider the problem of designing piecewise affine policies for two-stage adjustable robust linear optimization problems under right-hand side uncertainty. It is well known that a piecewise affine policy is optimal although the number of pieces can be exponentially large. A significant challenge in designing a practical piecewise affine policy is constructing good pieces of the uncertainty set. Here we address this challenge by introducing a new framework in which the uncertainty set is "approximated" by a "dominating" simplex. The corresponding policy is then based on a mapping from the uncertainty set to the simplex. Although our piecewise affine policy has exponentially many pieces, it can be computed efficiently by solving a compact linear program given the dominating simplex. Furthermore, we can find the dominating simplex in a closed form if the uncertainty set satisfies some symmetries and can be computed using a MIP in general. The performance of our policy is significantly better than the affine policy for many important uncertainty sets, such as ellipsoids and norm-balls, both theoretically and numerically. For instance, for hypersphere uncertainty set, our piecewise affine policy can be computed by an LP and gives a $O(m^{1/4})$-approximation whereas the affine policy requires us to solve a second order cone program and has a worst-case performance bound of $O(\sqrt m)$.;math.OC
1801.06753;Unitary dual of quasi-split $PGSO_8^E$;In this paper, we first determine the explicit Langlands classification for the quasi-split group $PGSO_8^E$ by following Casselman-Tadi$\acute{c}$'s Jacquet module machine. Based on the classification, we furthur sort out the unitary dual of $PGSO_8^E$ and compute the Aubert duality.;math.RT
1801.06754;The Slow-coloring Game on Sparse Graphs: $k$-Degenerate, Planar, and Outerplanar;The \emph{slow-coloring game} is played by Lister and Painter on a graph $G$. Initially, all vertices of $G$ are uncolored. In each round, Lister marks a nonempty set $M$ of uncolored vertices, and Painter colors a subset of $M$ that is independent in $G$. The game ends when all vertices are colored. The score of the game is the sum of the sizes of all sets marked by Lister. The goal of Painter is to minimize the score, while Lister tries to maximize it. We provide strategies for Painter on various classes of graphs whose vertices can be partitioned into a bounded number of sets inducing forests, including $k$-degenerate, acyclically $k$-colorable, planar, and outerplanar graphs. For example, we show that on an $n$-vertex graph $G$, Painter can keep the score to at most $\frac{3k+4}4n$ when $G$ is $k$-degenerate, $3.9857n$ when $G$ is acyclically $5$-colorable, $3n$ when $G$ is planar with a Hamiltonian dual, $\frac{8n+3m}5$ when $G$ is $4$-colorable with $m$ edges (hence $3.4n$ when $G$ is planar), and $\frac73n$ when $G$ is outerplanar.;math.CO
1801.06758;List strong edge-coloring of graphs with maximum degree 4;A strong edge-coloring of a graph $G$ is an edge-coloring such that any two edges on a path of length three receive distinct colors. We denote the strong chromatic index by $\chi_{s}'(G)$ which is the minimum number of colors that allow a strong edge-coloring of $G$. Erd\H{o}s and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il conjectured in 1985 that the upper bound of $\chi_{s}'(G)$ is $\frac{5}{4}\Delta^{2}$ when $\Delta$ is even and $\frac{1}{4}(5\Delta^{2}-2\Delta +1)$ when $\Delta$ is odd, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of $G$. The conjecture is proved right when $\Delta\leq3$. The best known upper bound for $\Delta=4$ is 22 due to Cranston previously. In this paper we extend the result of Cranston to list strong edge-coloring, that is to say, we prove that when $\Delta=4$ the upper bound of list strong chromatic index is 22.;math.CO
1801.06759;Efficient algorithms for computing a minimal homology basis;Efficient computation of shortest cycles which form a homology basis under $\mathbb{Z}_2$-additions in a given simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}$ has been researched actively in recent years. When the complex $\mathcal{K}$ is a weighted graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, the problem of computing a shortest (homology) cycle basis is known to be solvable in $O(m^2n/\log n+ n^2m)$-time. Several works \cite{borradaile2017minimum, greedy} have addressed the case when the complex $\mathcal{K}$ is a $2$-manifold. The complexity of these algorithms depends on the rank $g$ of the one-dimensional homology group of $\mathcal{K}$. This rank $g$ has a lower bound of $\Theta(n)$, where $n$ denotes the number of simplices in $\mathcal{K}$, giving an $O(n^4)$ worst-case time complexity for the algorithms in \cite{borradaile2017minimum,greedy}. This worst-case complexity is improved in \cite{annotation} to $O(n^\omega + n^2g^{\omega-1})$ for general simplicial complexes where $\omega&lt, 2.3728639$ \cite{le2014powers} is the matrix multiplication exponent. Taking $g=\Theta(n)$, this provides an $O(n^{\omega+1})$ worst-case algorithm. In this paper, we improve this time complexity. Combining the divide and conquer technique from \cite{DivideConquer} with the use of annotations from \cite{annotation}, we present an algorithm that runs in $O(n^\omega+n^2g)$ time giving the first $O(n^3)$ worst-case algorithm for general complexes. If instead of minimal basis, we settle for an approximate basis, we can improve the running time even further. We show that a $2$-approximate minimal homology basis can be computed in $O(n^{\omega}\sqrt{n \log n})$ expected time. We also study more general measures for defining the minimal basis and identify reasonable conditions on these measures that allow computing a minimal basis efficiently.;math.AT
1801.06760;Every planar graph without $i$-cycles adjacent simultaneously to $j$-cycles and $k$-cycles is DP-$4$-colorable when $\{i,j,k\}=\{3,4,5\}$;DP-coloring is a generalization of a list coloring in simple graphs. Many results in list coloring can be generalized in those of DP-coloring. Kim and Ozeki showed that planar graphs without $k$-cycles where $k=3,4,5,$ or $6$ are DP-$4$-colorable. Recently, Kim and Yu extended the result on $3$- and $4$-cycles by showing that planar graphs without triangles adjacent to $4$-cycles are DP-$4$-colorable. Xu and Wu showed that planar graphs without $5$-cycles adjacent simultaneously to $3$-cycles and $4$-cycles are $4$-choosable. In this paper, we extend the result on $5$-cycles and triangles adjacent to $4$-cycles by showing that planar graphs without $i$-cycles adjacent simultaneously to $j$-cycles and $k$-cycles are DP-$4$-colorable when $\{i,j,k\}=\{3,4,5\}.$ This also generalizes the result of Xu and Wu.;math.CO
1801.06762;Infinite staircases in the symplectic embedding problem for four-dimensional ellipsoids into polydisks;We study the symplectic embedding capacity function $C_{\beta}$ for ellipsoids $E(1,\alpha)\subset R^4$ into dilates of polydisks $P(1,\beta)$ as both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ vary through $[1,\infty)$. For $\beta=1$ Frenkel and Mueller showed that $C_{\beta}$ has an infinite staircase accumulating at $\alpha=3+2\sqrt{2}$, while for integer $\beta\geq 2$ Cristofaro-Gardiner, Frenkel, and Schlenk found that no infinite staircase arises. We show that, for arbitrary $\beta\in (1,\infty)$, the restriction of $C_{\beta}$ to $[1,3+2\sqrt{2}]$ is determined entirely by the obstructions from Frenkel and Mueller's work, leading $C_{\beta}$ on this interval to have a finite staircase with the number of steps tending to $\infty$ as $\beta\to 1$. On the other hand, in contrast to the case of integer $\beta$, for a certain doubly-indexed sequence of irrational numbers $L_{n,k}$ we find that $C_{L_{n,k}}$ has an infinite staircase, these $L_{n,k}$ include both numbers that are arbitrarily large and numbers that are arbitrarily close to $1$, with the corresponding accumulation points respectively arbitrarily large and arbitrarily close to $3+2\sqrt{2}$.;math.SG
1801.06763;Spectral extremal results with forbidding linear forests;The Tur\'an type extremal problem asks to maximize the number of edges over all graphs which do not contain fixed subgraphs. Similarly, the spectral Tur\'an type extremal problem asks to maximize spectral radius of all graphs which do not contain fixed subgraphs. <br />In this paper, we determine the maximum spectral radius of all graphs without containing a linear forest as a subgraph and characterize all corresponding extremal graphs. In addition, the maximum number of edges and spectral radius of all bipartite graphs without containing $k\cdot P_3$ as a subgraph are obtained and all extremal graphs are also characterized. Moreover, some relations between Tu\'an type extremal problems and spectral Tur\'an type extremal problems are discussed.;math.CO

These include the standard hyperbolic plane, generalised helicoid-type metrics and generalised Enneper metrics. Our proof is based on the method of compensated compactness and invariant regions in hyperbolic conservation laws, together with several observations on the geometric quantities (Gauss curvature, metric components etc.) of negatively curved surfaces.;math.AP

We consider "Waring's Problem for $f(x)$," i.e., whether every element of $\bbq$ can be written as a bounded sum of elements of $\{f(a)\mid a\in \mathbb{Q}\}$. For rational functions of degree $2$, we give necessary and sufficient conditions. For higher degrees, we prove that every polynomial of odd degree and every odd Laurent polynomial satisfies Waring's Problem. We also consider the "Easier Waring's Problem": whether every element of $\mathbb{Q}$ can be represented as a bounded sum of elements of $\{\pm f(a)\mid a\in \mathbb{Q}\}$.;math.NT
1801.06772;Stochastic PDEs in $\mathcal{S}^\prime$ for SDEs driven by L&#xe9,vy noise;In this article we show that a finite dimensional stochastic differential equation driven by a L\'evy process can be formulated as a stochastic partial differential equation. We prove the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions of such stochastic PDEs. The solutions that we construct have the `translation invariance' property. The special case of this correspondence for diffusion processes was proved in [Rajeev, Translation invariant diffusion in the space of tempered distributions, Indian J. Pure Appl.

1801.06776;A Robust Secure Hybrid Analog and Digital Receive Beamforming Scheme for Efficient Interference Reduction;Medium-scale or large-scale receive antenna array with digital beamforming can be employed at receiver to make a significant interference reduction, but leads to expensive cost and high complexity of the RF-chain circuit. To deal with this issue, a classic analog-and-digital beamforming (ADB) structure was proposed in the literature for greatly reducing the number of RF-chains. Based on the ADB structure, we in this paper propose a robust hybrid ADB scheme to resist directions of arrival (DOAs) estimation errors. The key idea of our scheme is to employ null space projection (NSP) in analog beamforming domain and diagonal loading (DL) method in digital beamforming domain. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme performs more robustly, and moreover, has a significant improvement on the receive signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) compared to NSP ADB scheme and DL method.;cs.IT
1801.06779;Atomic and antimatter semigroup algebras with rational exponents;In this paper, a semigroup algebra consisting of polynomial expressions with coefficients in a field $F$ and exponents in an additive submonoid $M$ of $\mathbb{Q}_{\ge 0}$ is called a Puiseux algebra and denoted by $F[M]$. Here we study the atomic structure of Puiseux algebras. To begin with, we answer the Isomorphism Problem for the class of Puiseux algebras, that is, we show that for a field $F$ if two Puiseux algebras $F[M_1]$ and $F[M_2]$ are isomorphic, then the monoids $M_1$ and $M_2$ are also isomorphic. Then we construct three classes of Puiseux algebras satisfying the following well-known atomic properties: the ACCP property, the bounded factorization property, and the finite factorization property. Finally, we give a full description of the seminormal closure, root closure, and complete integral closure of a Puiseux algebra, and use such description to provide a class of antimatter Puiseux algebras (i.e., Puiseux algebras containing no irreducibles).;math.AC
1801.06782;How can we naturally order and organize graph Laplacian eigenvectors?;When attempting to develop wavelet transforms for graphs and networks, some researchers have used graph Laplacian eigenvalues and eigenvectors in place of the frequencies and complex exponentials in the Fourier theory for regular lattices in the Euclidean domains. This viewpoint, however, has a fundamental flaw: on a general graph, the Laplacian eigenvalues cannot be interpreted as the frequencies of the corresponding eigenvectors. In this paper, we discuss this important problem further and propose a new method to organize those eigenvectors by defining and measuring "natural" distances between eigenvectors using the Ramified Optimal Transport Theory followed by embedding them into a low-dimensional Euclidean domain. We demonstrate its effectiveness using a synthetic graph as well as a dendritic tree of a retinal ganglion cell of a mouse.;math.SP
1801.06786;Weak convergence of branched conformal immersions with uniformly bounded areas and Willmore energies;In this paper, we firstly extend Theorem 5.1.1 in \cite {Helein} due to H\'elein to a rescaled branched conformal immersed sequence(c.f. Theorem 1.5). By virtue of this local convergence theorem, we study the blowup behavior of a sequence of branched conformal immersions of closed Riemannian surface in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with uniformly bounded areas and Willmore energies. Furthermore, we prove that the integral identity of Gauss curvature is true.;math.DG

1801.06794;A Rate-Optimal Construction of Codes with Sequential Recovery with Low Block Length;An erasure code is said to be a code with sequential recovery with parameters $r$ and $t$, if for any $s \leq t$ erased code symbols, there is an $s$-step recovery process in which at each step we recover exactly one erased code symbol by contacting at most $r$ other code symbols. In earlier work by the same authors, presented at ISIT 2017, we had given a construction for binary codes with sequential recovery from $t$ erasures, with locality parameter $r$, which were optimal in terms of code rate for given $r,t$, but where the block length was large, on the order of $r^{c^t}$, for some constant $c &gt,1$. In the present paper, we present an alternative construction of a rate-optimal code for any value of $t$ and any $r\geq3$, where the block length is significantly smaller, on the order of $r^{\frac{5t}{4}+\frac{7}{4}}$ (in some instances of order $r^{\frac{3t}{2}+2}$). Our construction is based on the construction of certain kind of tree-like graphs with girth $t+1$. We construct these graphs and hence the codes recursively.;cs.IT
1801.06795;On the variety of triangles for a hyper-Kaehler fourfold constructed by Debarre and Voisin;We study the similarities between the Fano varieties of lines on a cubic fourfold, a hyper-Kaehler fourfold studied by Beauville and Donagi, and the hyper-Kaehler fourfold constructed by Debarre and Voisin. We exhibit an analog of the notion of "triangle" for these varieties and prove that the 6-dimensional variety of "triangles" is a Lagrangian subvariety in the cube of the constructed hyper-Kaehler fourfold.;math.AG

1801.06803;Nonlinear operations on a class of modulation spaces;We discuss when the nonlinear operation $f\mapsto F(f)$ maps the modulation space $M^{p,q}_s(\mathbb{R}^n)$ ($1 \leq p,q \leq \infty$) to the same space again. It is known that $M^{p,q}_s(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is a multiplication algebra when $s &gt, n-n/q$, hence it is true for this space if $F$ is entire. We claim that it is still true for non-analytic $F$ when $q\geq4/3$.;math.FA
1801.06804;On Taylor coefficients of smooth functions;We study the Borel map, which maps infinitely differentiable functions on an interval to the jets of their Taylor coefficients at a given point in the interval. Our main results include a complete description of the image of the Borel map for Beurling classes of smooth functions and a moment-type summation method which allows one to recover a function from its Taylor jet. A surprising feature of this description is an unexpected threshold at the logarithmic class. Another interesting finding is a "duality" between non-quasianalytic and quasianalytic classes, which reduces the description of the image of the Borel map for non-quasianalytic classes to the one for the corresponding quasianalytic classes, and complements classical results of Carleson and Ehrenpreis.;math.CA
1801.06813;Lower bounds on the growth of Sobolev norms in some linear time dependent Schr&#xf6,dinger equations;In this paper we consider linear, time dependent Schr\"odinger equations of the form $i \partial_t \psi = K_0 \psi + V(t) \psi $, where $K_0$ is a positive self-adjoint operator with discrete spectrum and whose spectral gaps are asymptotically constant. <br />We give a strategy to construct bounded perturbations $V(t)$ such that the Hamiltonian $K_0 + V(t)$ generates unbounded orbits. We apply our abstract construction to three cases: (i) the Harmonic oscillator on $\mathbb R$, (ii) the half-wave equation on $\mathbb T$ and (iii) the Dirac-Schr\"odinger equation on the sphere. In each case, $V(t)$ is a smooth and periodic in time pseudodifferential operator and the Schr\"odinger equation has solutions fulfilling $\| \psi(t) \|_r \gtrsim |t|^{r }$ as $|t| \gg 1$.;math.AP
1801.06815;Combinatorial proofs and generalizations of conjectures related to Euler&#x27,s partition theorem;In a recent work, Andrews gave analytic proofs of two conjectures concerning some variations of two combinatorial identities between partitions of a positive integer into odd parts and partitions into distinct parts discovered by Beck. Subsequently, using the same method as Andrews, Chern presented the analytic proof of another Beck's conjecture relating the gap-free partitions and distinct partitions with odd length. However, the combinatorial interpretations of these conjectures are still unclear and required. In this paper, motivated by Glaisher's bijection, we give the combinatorial proofs of these three conjectures directly or by proving more generalized results.;math.CO
1801.06824;On generalized choice and coloring numbers;A well-known result of Alon shows that the coloring number of a graph is bounded by a function of its choosability.

1801.06828;Channel Input Adaptation via Natural Type Selection;For the model of communication through a discrete memoryless channel using i.i.d. random block codes, where the channel is changing slowly from block to block, we propose a stochastic algorithm for adaptation of the generating distribution of the code in the process of continuous reliable communication. The purpose of the algorithm is to match the generating distribution $Q(x)$ to the changing channel $P(y\,|\,x)$, so that reliable communication is maintained at some constant rate $R$. This is achieved by a feedback of one bit per transmitted block. The feedback bit is determined by the joint type of the last transmitted codeword and the received block, a constant threshold $T&gt,R$, and some conditional distribution $\Phi(x\,|\,y)$. Depending on the value of the feedback bit, the system parameters $Q(x)$ and $\Phi(x\,|\,y)$ are both updated according to the joint type of the last transmitted and received blocks, or remain unchanged. <br />We show that, under certain technical conditions, the iterations of the algorithm lead to a distribution $Q(x)$, which guarantees reliable communication for all rates below the threshold $T$, provided that the discrete memoryless channel capacity of $P(y\,|\,x)$ stays above $T$.;cs.IT
1801.06835;Distributed Multi-User Wireless Charging Power Allocation;Wireless power charging enables portable devices to be permanently unplugged. Due to its low transmission power and low transmission efficiency, it requires much longer time slot to charge users compared with that for data transmission in wireless communication networks. Besides, each user's demand urgency needs to be taken into consideration for power allocation. Therefore, new algorithms are essential for wireless power allocation in multi-user wireless charging networks. In this paper, this problem is formulated as a static noncooperative game. It is shown that there exists a unique Nash equilibrium, which is the static state of the wireless power charging network. A distributed power allocation algorithm is proposed to compute the Nash equilibrium of the game. The main result of the paper consists of rigorous analysis of the distributed algorithm for power allocation. The algorithm is shown to converge to Nash equilibrium of the game with exponentially convergence rate for arbitrary initial value with synchronous scheduling. Moreover, the distributed algorithm is also convergence guaranteed with asynchronous scheduling under communication delay and packet drops. Numerical simulations prove the correctness of the analysis and demonstrate the fast convergence of the algorithm and the robustness to synchronous scheduling.;cs.IT
1801.06838;Global and Concrete Quantizations on General Type I Groups;In recent papers and books, a global quantization has been developed for {\it unimodular} groups of type I\,. It involves operator-valued symbols defined on the product between the group $\G$ and its unitary dual $\wG$\,, composed of equivalence classes of irreducible representations. For compact or for graded Lie groups, this has already been developed into a powerful pseudo-differential calculus. In the present article we extend the formalism to arbitrary locally compact groups of type I\,, making use of the Fourier theory of non-unimodular second countable groups. The unitary dual and its Plancherel measure being quite abstract in general, we put into evidence situations in which concrete forms are available. Kirillov theory and parametrizations of large parts of $\wG$ allow rewriting the basic formulae in a manageable form. Some examples of completely solvable groups are worked out.;math.FA
1801.06841;UAV-Enabled Cooperative Jamming for Improving Secrecy of Ground Wiretap Channel;This letter proposes a novel UAV-enabled mobile jamming scheme to improve the secrecy rate of ground wiretap channel. Specifically, a UAV is employed to transmit jamming signals to combat against eavesdropping. Such a mobile jamming scheme is particularly appealing since the UAV-enabled jammer can fly close to the eavesdropper and opportunistically jam it by leveraging the UAV's mobility. We aim to maximize the average secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and jamming power over a given flight period. To make the problem more tractable, we drive a closed-form lower bound for the achievable secrecy rate, based on which the UAV's trajectory and transmit power are optimized alternately by an efficient iterative algorithm applying the block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint design can significantly enhance the secrecy rate of the considered wiretap system as compared to benchmark schemes.;cs.IT
1801.06849;Multiplicity of singularities is not a bi-Lipschitz invariant;It was conjectured that multiplicity of a singularity is bi-Lipschitz invariant.

1801.06850;Mean field dynamics of a quantum tracer particle interacting with a boson gas;We consider the dynamics of a heavy quantum tracer particle coupled to a non-relativistic boson field in ${\mathbb R}^3$. The pair interactions of the bosons are of mean-field type, with coupling strength proportional to $\frac1N$ where $N$ is the expected particle number. Assuming that the mass of the tracer particle is proportional to $N$, we derive generalized Hartree equations in the limit $N\rightarrow\infty$. Moreover, we prove the global well-posedness of the associated Cauchy problem for sufficiently weak interaction potentials.;math-ph

1801.06854;Outage Analysis of Energy Harvesting based Opportunistic Cooperative Communication Systems;Wireless energy harvesting constitutes an effective way to prolong the lifetime of wireless networks. In this paper, an opportunistic decode-and-forward cooperative communication system is investigated, where the energy-constrained relays harvest energy from the received information signal and the co-channel interference (CCI) signals and then use that harvested energy to forward the correctly decoded signal to the destination. Different from conventional relaying system with constant energy supplier, the transmission power of the energy-constrained relay depends on the available energy that harvested, which is a random process. Best relay selection that takes into account all the impacting ingredients on the received signal quality at the destination is deployed. The exact closed-form expression of the outage probability is derived, and the optimal value of the energy harvesting ratio for achieving minimum outage is numerically investigated. In addition, the impacts of the CCI signals on the system's outage and diversity performances are analyzed. It is shown that the proposed relaying scheme can achieve full diversity order equal to the number of relays without the need of fixed power supplier.;cs.IT
1801.06865;Interpolation between H\&quot, older and Lebesgue spaces with applications;Classical interpolation inequality of the type $\|u\|_{X}\leq C\|u\|_{Y}^{\theta}\|u\|_{Z}^{1-\theta}$ is well known in the case when $X$, $Y$, $Z$ are Lebesgue spaces. In this paper we show that this result may be extended by replacing norms $\|\cdot\|_{Y}$ or $\|\cdot\|_{X}$ by suitable H\" older semi-norm. We shall even prove sharper version involving weak Lorentz norm. We apply this result to prove the Gagliardo--Nirenberg inequality for a wider scale of parameters.;math.FA

Here, we focus on system of four coupled transport-reaction equations that arises from an age-structuring of a species of turning individuals. The highlight consists of the explicit construction and characterization of counter-propagating traveling waves, patterns which have been observed in bacterial colonies. Stability analysis reveals conditions for the wave formation as well as pulsating-in-time spatially constant solutions.;math.AP
1801.06872;Existence of ground state solution and concentration of maxima for a class of indefinite variational problems;In this paper we study the existence of ground state solution and concentration of maxima for a class of strongly indefinite problem like $$ \left\{\begin{array}{l} -\Delta u+V(x)u=A(\epsilon x)f(u) \quad \mbox{in} \quad \R^{N}, \\ u\in H^{1}(\R^{N}), \end{array}\right. \eqno{(P)_{\epsilon}} $$ where $N \geq 1$, $\epsilon$ is a positive parameter, $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function with subcritical growth and $V,A: \mathbb{R}^{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ are continuous functions verifying some technical conditions. Here $V$ is a $\mathbb{Z}^N$-periodic function, $0 \not\in \sigma(-\Delta + V)$, the spectrum of $-\Delta +V$, and $$ 0 &lt, \inf_{x \in \R^{N}}A(x)\leq \displaystyle\lim_{|x|\rightarrow+\infty}A(x)&lt,\sup_{x \in \R^{N}}A(x). $$;math.AP
1801.06874;Optimal Co-Optimizing of Distributed Generation and ESS Facilities Considering Voltage Stability;The paper deals with the optimal sizing and allocation of dispersed generation, and distributed storage systems. The optimization aims at minimizing the sum of the costs sustained by the distributor for the power losses, for network upgrading, for carrying out the reactive power service and the costs of storage and capacitor installation, over a planning period of several years. Also, analysis of the effect of distributed generation capacity and location on voltage stability enhancement of distribution networks are presented in this paper. The analysis is performed using a steady state voltage stability index which can be evaluated at each node of the distribution system. Different optimal capacities and locations are used to check this effect. The location of distributed generation has the main effect on the system voltage stability. Voltage stability should be taken into account as one of the objectives of distributed generation optimal allocation techniques. The analysis is conducted on a 69-node distribution system in order to show the feasibility of the proposed procedure.;math.OC
1801.06877;Limiting Distributions of Spectral Radii for Product of Matrices from the Spherical Ensemble;Consider the product of $m$ independent $n\times n$ random matrices from the spherical ensemble for $m\ge 1$. The spectral radius is defined as the maximum absolute value of the $n$ eigenvalues of the product matrix. When $m=1$, the limiting distribution for the spectral radii has been obtained by Jiang and Qi (2017). In this paper, we investigate the limiting distributions for the spectral radii in general. When $m$ is a fixed integer, we show that the spectral radii converge weakly to distributions of functions of independent Gamma random variables. When $m=m_n$ tends to infinity as $n$ goes to infinity, we show that the logarithmic spectral radii have a normal limit.;math.ST
1801.06881;The symplectic area of a geodesic triangle in a Hermitian symmetric space of compact type;Let $M$ be an irreducible Hermitian symmetric space of compact type, and let $\omega$ be its K\"ahler form. For a triplet $(p_1,p_2,p_3)$ of points in $M$ we study conditions under which a geodesic triangle $\mathcal T(p_1,p_2,p_3)$ with vertices $p_1,p_2,p_3$ can be unambiguously defined. We consider the integral $A(p_1,p_2,p_3)=\int_\Sigma \omega$, where $\Sigma$ is a surface filling the triangle $\mathcal T(p_1,p_2,p_3)$ and discuss the dependence of $A(p_1,p_2,p_3)$ on the surface $\Sigma$. Under mild conditions on the three points, we prove an explicit formula for $A(p_1,p_2,p_3)$ analogous to the known formula for the symplectic area of a geodesic triangle in a non-compact Hermitian symmetric space.;math.DG
1801.06882;Generalized Laminar Matroids;Nested matroids were introduced by Crapo in 1965 and have appeared frequently in the literature since then. A flat of a matroid $M$ is Hamiltonian if it has a spanning circuit. A matroid $M$ is nested if and only if its Hamiltonian flats form a chain under inclusion, $M$ is laminar if and only if, for every $1$-element independent set $X$, the Hamiltonian flats of $M$ containing $X$ form a chain under inclusion. We generalize these notions to define the classes of $k$-closure-laminar and $k$-laminar matroids. This paper focuses on structural properties of these classes noting that, while the second class is always minor-closed, the first is if and only if $k \le 3$. The main results are excluded-minor characterizations for the classes of 2-laminar and 2-closure-laminar matroids.;math.CO
1801.06884;On the Existence of Normal Square and Nth Roots of Operators;The primary purpose of this paper is to show the existence of normal square and nth roots of some classes of bounded operators on Hilbert spaces. Two interesting simple results hold. Namely, under simple conditions we show that if any operator $T$ is such that $T^2=0$, then this implies that $T$ is normal and so $T=0$. Also, we will see when the square root of an arbitrary bounded operator is normal.;math.FA

A graph $G$ on at least seven vertices with a vertex $v$ such that $G-v$ is planar and $t$ triangles satisfies $|E(G)| \leq 3|V(G)|- 9 + t/3$. <br />2. For $p=2,3,\ldots,9$, a triangle-free graph $G$ on at least $2p-5$ vertices with no $K_p$-minor satisfies $|E(G)|\leq (p-2)|V(G)| - (p-2)^2$.;math.CO
1801.06888;On Lagrangians with Reduced-Order Euler-Lagrange Equations;If a Lagrangian defining a variational problem has order $k$ then its Euler-Lagrange equations generically have order $2k$. This paper considers the case where the Euler-Lagrange equations have order strictly less than $2k$, and shows that in such a case the Lagrangian must be a polynomial in the highest-order derivative variables, with a specific upper bound on the degree of the polynomial. The paper also provides an explicit formulation, derived from a geometrical construction, of a family of such $k$-th order Lagrangians, and it is conjectured that all such Lagrangians arise in this way.;math.DG
1801.06891;Law of the first passage triple of a spectrally positive strictly stable process;For a spectrally positive and strictly stable process with index in (1,2), a series representation is obtained for the joint distribution of the "first passage triple" that consists of the time of first passage and the undershoot and the overshoot at first passage. The result leads to several corollaries, including 1) the joint law of the first passage triple and the pre-passage running supremum, and 2) at a fixed time point, the joint law of the process' value, running supremum, and the time of the running supremum. The representation can be decomposed as a sum of strictly positive functions that allows exact sampling of the first passage triple.;math.PR
1801.06893;Schubert Decomposition for Milnor Fibers of the Varieties of Singular Matrices;We consider the varieties of singular $m \times m$ complex matrices which may be either general, symmetric or skew-symmetric (with $m$ even). For these varieties we have shown in another paper that they had compact "model submanifolds", for the homotopy types of the Milnor fibers which are classical symmetric spaces in the sense of Cartan. In this paper we use these models, combined with results due to a number of authors concerning the Schubert decomposition of Lie groups, symmetric spaces via the Cartan model together with Iwasawa decomposition to give a cell decomposition of the global Milnor fibers. The Schubert decomposition is in terms of "unique ordered factorizations" of matrices in the Milnor fibers as products of " pseudo-rotations". In the case of symmetric or skew-symmetric matrices, this factorization has the form of iterated "Cartan conjugacies" by pseudo-rotations. The "Schubert cycles" (the closures of the Schubert cells), are images of products of suspensions of projective spaces (complex, real, or quaternionic). For general or skew-symmetric matrices the Schubert cycles have fundamental classes, and for symmetric matrices $\mod 2$ classes, giving a basis for the homology, corresponding to the cohomology generators for the symmetric spaces. For general matrices the duals of the Schubert cycles are given as explicit monomials in the generators of the exterior cohomology algebra, and for symmetric matrices they are related to Stiefel-Whitney classes of an associated vector bundle. Furthermore, for any matrix singularity of these types the pull-backs of these cohomolgy classes generate a characteristic subalgebra of the cohomology of the Milnor fiber. These results extend to exceptional orbit hypersurfaces, complements and links.;math.AG
1801.06897;The Optimal Majority Threshold as a Function of the Variation Coefficient of the Environment;Within the model of social dynamics determined by collective decisions in a stochastic environment (ViSE model), we consider the case of a homogeneous society consisting of classically rational economic agents (or homines economici, or egoists). We present expressions for the optimal majority threshold and the maximum expected capital increment as functions of the parameters of the environment. An estimate of the rate of change of the optimal threshold at zero is given, which is an absolute constant: $(\sqrt{2/\pi}-\sqrt{\pi/2})/2$.;math.OC
1801.06904;The exact Power Law for Buffon&#x27,s needle landing near some Random Cantor Sets;In this paper, we study the Favard length of some random Cantor sets of Hausdorff dimension 1. We start with a unit disk in the plane and replace the unit disk by $4$ disjoint subdisks (with equal distance to each other) of radius $1/4$ inside and tangent to the unit disk. By repeating this operation in a self-similar manner and adding a random rotation in each step, we can generate a random Cantor set ${\cal D}(\omega)$. Let ${\cal D}_n$ be the $n$-th generation in the construction, which is comparable to the $4^{-n}$-neighborhood of ${\cal D}$. We are interested in the decay rate of the Favard length of these sets ${\cal D}_n$ as $n\to\infty$, which is the likelihood (up to a constant) that "Buffon's needle" dropped randomly will fall into the $4^{-n}$-neighborhood of ${\cal D}$. It is well known in [P. Mattila, Orthogonal projections, Riesz capacities, and Minkowski content, Indiana Univ. Math. J. 39 (1990), no. 1, 185-198] that the lower bound of the Favard length of ${\cal D}_n(\omega)$ is constant multiple of $n^{-1}$. We show that the upper bound of the Favard length of ${\cal D}_n(\omega)$ is $C n^{-1}$ for some $C&gt,0$ in the average sense. We also prove the similar linear decay for the Favard length of ${\cal D}^d_n(\omega)$ which is the $d^{-n}$-neighborhood of a self-similar random Cantor set with degree $d$ greater than $4$. Notice in the non-random case where the self-similar set has degree greater than $4$, the best known result for the decay rate of the Favard length is $e^{-c\sqrt {\log n}}$.;math.AP
1801.06906;Summatory function of the number of prime factors;We consider the summatory function of the number of prime factors for integers $\leq x$ over arithmetic progressions. Numerical experiments suggest that some arithmetic progressions consist more number of prime factors than others. Greg Martin conjectured that the difference of the summatory functions should attain a constant sign for all sufficiently large $x$. In this paper, we provide strong evidence for Greg Martin's conjecture. Moreover, we derive a general theorem for arithmetic functions from the Selberg class.;math.NT
1801.06908;Spectral analysis of the spin-boson Hamiltonian with two photons for arbitrary coupling;We study the spectrum of the spin-boson model with two photons in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for arbitrary coupling $\alpha&gt,0$. It is shown that the discrete spectrum is finite and the essential spectrum consists of a half-line the bottom of which is a unique zero of a simple Nevanlinna function. Besides the simplicity and more abstract nature of our approach, the main novelty is the achievement of these results under "minimal" regularity conditions on the photon dispersion and the coupling function.;math.SP

1801.06910;Variable coefficient Wolff-type inequalities and sharp local smoothing estimates for wave equations on manifolds;The sharp Wolff-type decoupling estimates of Bourgain--Demeter are extended to the variable coefficient setting. These results are applied to obtain new sharp local smoothing estimates for wave equations on compact Riemannian manifolds, away from the endpoint regularity exponent. More generally, local smoothing estimates are established for a natural class of Fourier integral operators, at this level of generality the results are sharp in odd dimensions, both in terms of the regularity exponent and the Lebesgue exponent.;math.AP

1801.06912;Magnus-Zassenhaus methods for the semiclassical Schr&#xf6,dinger equation with oscillatory time-dependent potentials;Schr\"odinger equations with time-dependent potentials are of central importance in quantum physics and theoretical chemistry, where they aid in the simulation and design of systems and processes at atomic scales. Numerical approximation of these equations is particularly difficult in the semiclassical regime because of the highly oscillatory nature of solution. Highly oscillatory potentials such as lasers compound these difficulties even further. Altogether, these effects render a large number of standard numerical methods less effective in this setting. In this paper we will develop a class of high-order exponential splitting schemes that are able to overcome these challenges by combining the advantages of integral-preserving simplified-commutator Magnus expansions with those of symmetric Zassenhaus splittings. This allows us to use large time steps in our schemes even in the presence of highly oscillatory potentials and solutions.;math.NA
1801.06913;Magnus-Lanczos methods with simplified commutators for the Schr&#xf6,dinger equation with a time-dependent potential;The computation of the Schr\"odinger equation featuring time-dependent potentials is of great importance in quantum control of atomic and molecular processes. These applications often involve highly oscillatory potentials and require inexpensive but accurate solutions over large spatio-temporal windows. In this work we develop Magnus expansions where commutators have been simplified. Consequently, the exponentiation of these Magnus expansions via Lanczos iterations is significantly cheaper than that for traditional Magnus expansions. At the same time, and unlike most competing methods, we simplify integrals instead of discretising them via quadrature at the outset -- this gives us the flexibility to handle a variety of potentials, being particularly effective in the case of highly oscillatory potentials, where this strategy allows us to consider significantly larger time steps.;math.NA
1801.06914;Maximal metrics for the first Steklov eigenvalue on surfaces;In recent years, eigenvalue optimization problems have received a lot of attention, in particular, due to their connection with the theory of minimal surfaces. In the present paper we prove that on any orientable surface there exists a smooth metric maximizing the first normalized Steklov eigenvalue. For surfaces of genus zero, this has been earlier proved by A. Fraser and R. Schoen. Our approach builds upon their ideas and further developments due to R. Petrides. As a corollary, we show that there exist free boundary branched minimal immersions of an arbitrary compact orientable surface with boundary into a Euclidean ball of some dimension.;math.DG
1801.06915;Generically free representations III: extremely bad characteristic;In parts I and II, we determined which faithful irreducible representations $V$ of a simple linear algebraic group $G$ are generically free for Lie($G$), i.e., which $V$ have an open subset consisting of vectors whose stabilizer in Lie($G$) is zero, with some assumptions on the characteristic of the field. This paper settles the remaining cases, which are of a different nature because Lie($G$) has a more complicated structure and there need not exist general dimension bounds of the sort that exist in good characteristic.;math.RT
1801.06916;On multi-poly-Bernoulli-Carlitz numbers;We introduce multi-poly-Bernoulli-Carlitz numbers, function field analogues of multi-poly-Bernoulli numbers of Imatomi-Kaneko-Takeda. We explicitly describe multi-poly-Bernoulli Carlitz numbers in terms of the Carlitz factorial and the Stirling-Carlitz numbers of the second kind and also show their relationships with function field analogues of finite multiple zeta values.;math.NT
1801.06918;Rational extensions of the representation ring global functor and a splitting of global equivariant $K$-theory;We identify the group of homomorphisms $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{GF}}(F,\mathbf{RU}_{\mathbb Q})$ in the category of ($\operatorname{fin}$)-global functors to the rationalization of the unitary representation ring functor and deduce that the higher $\operatorname{Ext}$-groups $\operatorname{Ext}^n_{\mathcal{GF}}(F,\mathbf{RU}_{\mathbb Q})$, $n\geq 2$ have to vanish. This leads to a rational splitting of the ($\operatorname{fin}$)-global equivariant $K$-theory spectrum into a sum of Eilenberg-MacLane spectra. Interpreted in terms of cohomology theories, it means that the equivariant Chern character is compatible with restrictions along all group homomorphisms.;math.AT
1801.06921;String topology with gravitational descendants, and periods of Landau-Ginzburg potentials;This paper introduces new operations on the string topology of a smooth manifold: gravitational descendants of its cotangent bundle, which are augmentations of the Chas-Sullivan $L_\infty$ algebra structure of the loop space. The definition extends to Liouville domains. Descendants of the $n$-torus are computed. <br />To a monotone Lagrangian torus in a symplectic manifold, one associates a Laurent polynomial called the Landau-Ginzburg potential, by counting holomorphic disks. This paper proves the following mirror symmetry prediction: the constant terms of the powers of an LG potential are equal to descendant Gromov-Witten invariants of the ambient manifold.;math.SG
1801.06930;Alternance Theorems and Chebyshev Splines Approximation;One of the purposes in this paper is to provide a better understanding of the alternance property which occurs in Chebyshev polynomial approximation and piecewise polynomial approximation problems. In the first part of this paper, we propose an original approach to obtain new proofs of the well known necessary and sufficient optimality conditions. There are two main advantages of this approach. First of all, the proofs are much simpler and easier to understand than the existing proofs. Second, these proofs are constructive and therefore they lead to alternative-based algorithms that can be considered as Remez-type approximation algorithms. In the second part of this paper, we develop new local optimality conditions for free knot polynomial spline approximation. The proofs for free knot approximation are relying on the techniques developed in the first part of this paper.;math.NA
1801.06938;Randomized sampling for basis functions construction in generalized finite element methods;In the framework of generalized finite element methods for elliptic equations with rough coefficients, efficiency and accuracy of the numerical method depend critically on the use of appropriate basis functions. This work explores several random sampling strategies that construct approximations to the optimal set of basis functions of a given dimension, and proposes a quantitative criterion to analyze and compare these sampling strategies. Numerical evidence shows that the best results are achieved by two strategies, Random Gaussian and Smooth boundary sampling.;math.OC
1801.06943;Strictly unital A-infinity algebras;Given a graded module over a commutative ring, we define a dg-Lie algebra whose Maurer-Cartan elements are the strictly unital A-infinity algebra structures on that module. We use this to generalize Positselski's result that a curvature term on the bar construction compensates for a lack of augmentation, from a field to arbitrary commutative base ring. We also use this to show that the reduced Hochschild cochains control the strictly unital deformation functor. We motivate these results by giving a full development of the deformation theory of a nonunital A-infinity algebra.;math.KT
1801.06946;Yet Another Convex Sets Subtraction with Application in Nondifferentiable Optimization;This paper introduces a new subtraction operation for convex sets, which defines their difference as a collection of inclusion-minimal convex sets with appropriate definitions of linear operations on them. With these operations the set of collections becomes a linear vector space with common zero and possibility to invert Minkowski summation. As the demonstration of usability of this concept the Lipschitz continuity of \(\epsilon\)-subdifferentials of convex analysis is proved in a novel way.;math.OC
1801.06947;Generalized coinvariant algebras for $G(r,1,n)$ in the Stanley-Reisner setting;Let $r$ and $n$ be positive integers, let $G_n$ be the complex reflection group of $n \times n$ monomial matrices whose entries are $r^{\textrm{th}}$ roots of unity and let $0 \leq k \leq n$ be an integer. Recently, Haglund, Rhoades and Shimozono ($r=1$) and Chan and Rhoades ($r&gt,1$) introduced quotients $R_{n,k}$ (for $r&gt,1$) and $S_{n,k}$ (for $r \geq 1$) of the polynomial ring $\mathbb{C}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ in $n$ variables, which for $k=n$ reduce to the classical coinvariant algebra attached to $G_n$. When $n=k$ and $r=1$, Garsia and Stanton exhibited a quotient of $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{y}_S]$ isomorphic to the coinvariant algebra, where $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{y}_S]$ is the polynomial ring in $2^n-1$ variables whose variables are indexed by nonempty subsets $S \subseteq [n]$. In this paper, we will define analogous quotients that are isomorphic to $R_{n,k}$ and $S_{n,k}$.;math.CO
1801.06949;Simple equivariant C*-algebras whose full and reduced crossed products coincide;For any second countable locally compact group G, we construct a simple G-C*-algebra whose full and reduced crossed product norms coincide. We then construct its G-equivariant representation on another simple G-C*-algebra without the coincidence condition. This settles two problems posed by Anantharaman-Delaroche in 2002. Some constructions involve the Baire category theorem.;math.OA
1801.06950;A unified framework for asymptotic analysis and computation of finite Hankel transform;In this paper we present a unified framework for asymptotic analysis and computation of the finite Hankel transform. This framework enables us to derive asymptotic expansions of the transform, including the cases where the oscillator has zeros and stationary points. As a consequence, two efficient and affordable methods for computing the transform numerically are developed and a detailed analysis of their asymptotic error estimate is carried out. Numerical examples are provided to confirm our analysis.;math.NA
1801.06956;The Capacity of Degraded Cognitive Interference Channel with Unidirectional Destination Cooperation;Previous works established the capacity region for some special cases of discrete memoryless degraded cognitive interference channel (CIC) with unidirectional destination cooperation (UDC). In this letter, we characterize the capacity region of the general discrete memoryless degraded CIC-UDC. The obtained results imply that the capacity region is achieved by the Gel'fand-Pinsker coding at the cognitive transmitter, superposition coding at the primary transmitter and decode-and-forward at the relay. Furthermore, using this general result and a novel converse analysis, we establish the capacity of the Gaussian degraded CIC-UDC, which had been open until this work.;cs.IT
1801.06959;Asymptotic behaviour of instantons on Cylinder Manifolds;IIn this article, we study the instanton equation on the cylinder over a closed manifold $X$ which admits non-zero smooth $3$-form $P$ and $4$-form $Q$. Our results are (1) if $X$ is a \textbf{good} manifold, i.e., $P,Q$ satisfying $d\ast_{X}P=d\ast_{X}Q=0$, then the instanton with integrable curvature decays exponentially at the ends, and, (2) if $X$ is a real Killing spinor manifold, i.e., $P,Q$ satisfying $dP=4Q$ and $d\ast_{X}Q=(n-3)\ast_{X}P$, we prove that the solution of instanton equation is trivial under some mild conditions.;math.DG
1801.06961;Stable lattices in modular Galois representations and Hida deformation;In this paper, we discuss the variation of the numbers of the isomorphic classes of stable lattices when the weight and the level varies in a Hida deformation by using the Kubota-Leopoldt $p$-adic $L$-function. As a corollary, we give a sufficient condition for the numbers of the isomorphic classes of stable lattices in Hida deformation to be infinite.;math.NT
1801.06964;Opportunism in Dynamic Spectrum Access for 5G: A Concept and Its Application to Duplexing;With the envisioned massive Internet-of-Things (IoT) era, one of the challenges for 5G wireless systems will be handling the unprecedented spectrum crunch. A potential solution has emerged in the form of spectrum sharing, which deviates from a monopolistic spectrum usage system. This article investigates the medium access control (MAC) as a means of increasing the viability of the spectrum sharing technique. We first quantify the opportunity of spectrum access in a probabilistic manner, a method referred to as opportunity probability (OP). Based on the OP framework, we propose a random MAC algorithm in which the access of a node is randomly determined with its own OP value. As a possible application of our OP based random MAC, we propose a hybrid half duplex (HD)/full duplex (FD) communication where each pair decides the duplexing mode according to the OP values of the two pair nodes. This approach fits well with the spectrum sharing system since it enables a flexible operation for the spectrum access according to the spectrum usage level. From the numerical analysis, we validate the feasibility and verify the performance enhancements by implementing an FPGA based real-time prototype. Measurements and numerical results confirm that the proposed architecture can achieve up to 4 times higher system throughput than conventional LTE-TDD (time division duplex) systems.;cs.IT
1801.06967;Lower bounds of Lipschitz constants on foliations;In this paper we consider Llarull's theorem in the foliation case and get a lower bound of the Lipschitz constant of the map $M\to S^n$ in the foliation case under the spin condition.;math.DG
1801.06968;Convexity of mutual information along the heat flow;We study the convexity of mutual information along the evolution of the heat equation. We prove that if the initial distribution is log-concave, then mutual information is always a convex function of time. We also prove that if the initial distribution is either bounded, or has finite fourth moment and Fisher information, then mutual information is eventually convex, i.e., convex for all large time. Finally, we provide counterexamples to show that mutual information can be nonconvex at small time.;cs.IT
1801.06970;Piecewise linear approximate solution of fractional order non-stiff and stiff differential-algebraic equations by orthogonal hybrid functions;A simple yet effective numerical method using orthogonal hybrid functions consisting of piecewise constant orthogonal sample-and-hold functions and piecewise linear orthogonal triangular functions is proposed to solve numerically fractional order non-stiff and stiff differential-algebraic equations. The complementary generalized one-shot operational matrices, which are the foundation for the developed numerical method, are derived to estimate the Riemann-Liouville fractional order integral in the new orthogonal hybrid function domain. It is theoretically and numerically shown that the numerical method converges the approximate solutions to the exact solution in the limit of step size tends to zero. Numerical examples are solved using the proposed method and the obtained results are compared with the results of some popular semi-analytical techniques used for solving fractional order differential-algebraic equations in the literature. Our results are in good accordance with the results of those semi-analytical methods in case of non-stiff problems and our method provides valid approximate solution to stiff problem (fractional order version of Chemical Akzo Nobel problem) which those semi-analytical methods fails to solve.;math.NA
1801.06971;New code upper bounds for the folded n-cube;Let $\Gamma$ denote a distance-regular graph. The maximum size of codewords with minimum distance at least $d$ is denoted by $A(\Gamma,d)$. Let $\square_n$ denote the folded $n$-cube $H(n,2)$. We give an upper bound on $A(\square_n,d)$ based on block-diagonalizing the Terwilliger algebra of $\square_n$ and on semidefinite programming.The technique of this paper is an extension of the approach taken by A. Schrijver \cite{s} on the study of $A(H(n,2),d)$.;math.CO
1801.06972;New orthogonal hybrid function based numerical method to solve system of fractional order differential equations;In this paper, an easy-to-implement and computationally effective numerical method based on the new orthogonal hybrid functions is developed to solve system of fractional order differential equations numerically. The new orthogonal hybrid functions are hybrid of the piecewise constant orthogonal sample-and-hold functions and the piecewise linear orthogonal right-handed triangular functions. The proposed method uses the generalized one-shot operational matrices which approximate the Riemann-Liouville fractional order integral in the orthogonal hybrid function domain. The convergence of the numerical method is studied. Illustrative examples such as fractional order smoking model, fractional order model for lung cancer, fractional order model of Hepatitis B infection etc. are solved by the proposed numerical method. The results prove the validity and reliability of the proposed numerical method.;math.NA
1801.06973;Novel hybrid function operational matrices of fractional integration: An application for solving multi-order fractional differential equations;In the present work, an attempted was made to develop a numerical algorithm by the use of new orthogonal hybrid functions formed from hybrid of piecewise constant orthogonal sample-and-hold functions and piecewise linear orthogonal triangular functions to obtain the numerical solution of multi-order fractional differential equations. The construction of numerical algorithm involves a formula, consisting of generalized one-shot operational matrices, expressing explicitly the Riemann-Liouville fractional order integral of the new orthogonal hybrid functions in terms of new orthogonal hybrid functions themselves. A set of test problems comprising of linear and nonlinear multi-order fractional differential equations with constant and variable coefficients was considered to demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of our algorithm and to compare our results with those acquired by some other well-known methods used for solving multi-order fractional differential equations in the literature. The comparison highlighted that our algorithm exhibits superior performance to those methods.;math.NA
1801.06974;C*-superrigidity of 2-step nilpotent groups;We show that torsion-free finitely generated nilpotent groups are characterised by their group C*-algebras and we additionally recover their nilpotency class as well as the subquotients of the upper central series. We then use a C*-bundle decomposition and apply K-theoretic methods based on noncommutative tori to prove that every torsion-free finitely generated 2-step nilpotent group can be recovered from its group C*-algebra.;math.OA
1801.06977;Density function for the second coefficient of the Hilbert-Kunz function;We prove that, analogous to the HK density function, (used for studying the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity, the leading coefficient of the HK function), there exists a $\beta$-density function $g_{R, {\bf m}}:[0,\infty)\longrightarrow {\mathbb R}$, where $(R, {\bf m})$ is the homogeneous coordinate ring associated to the toric pair $(X, D)$, such that $$\int_0^{\infty}g_{R, {\bf m}}(x)dx = \beta(R, {\bf m}),$$ where $\beta(R, {\bf m})$ is the second coefficient of the Hilbert-Kunz function for $(R, {\bf m})$, as constructed by Huneke-McDermott-Monsky. <br />Moreover we prove, (1) the function $g_{R, {\bf m}}:[0, \infty)\longrightarrow {\mathbb R}$ is compactly supported and is continuous except at finitely many points, (2) the function $g_{R, {\bf m}}$ is multiplicative for the Segre products with the expression involving the first two coefficients of the Hilbert polynomials of the rings involved. <br />Here we also prove and use a result (which is a refined version of a result by Henk-Linke) on the boundedness of the coefficients of rational Ehrhart quasi-polynomials of convex rational polytopes.;math.AC
1801.06978;A maximal function approach to two-measure Poincar&#xe9, inequalities;This paper extends the self-improvement result of Keith and Zhong in [16] to the two-measure case. Our main result shows that a two-measure $(p,p)$-Poincar\'e inequality for $1&lt,p&lt,\infty$ improves to a $(p,p-\varepsilon)$-Poincar\'e inequality for some $\varepsilon&gt,0$ under a balance condition on the measures. The corresponding result for a maximal Poincar\'e inequality is also considered. In this case the left-hand side in the Poincar\'e inequality is replaced with an integral of a sharp maximal function and the results hold without a balance condition. Moreover, validity of maximal Poincar\'e inequalities is used to characterize the self-improvement of two-measure Poincar\'e inequalities. Examples are constructed to illustrate the role of the assumptions. Harmonic analysis and PDE techniques are used extensively in the arguments.;math.CA
1801.06981;Spherical means on the Heisenberg group: Stability of a maximal function estimate;Consider the surface measure $\mu$ on a sphere in a nonvertical hyperplane on the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$, $n\ge 2$, and the convolution $f*\mu$. Form the associated maximal function $Mf=\sup_{t&gt,0}|f*\mu_t|$ generated by the automorphic dilations. We use decoupling inequalities due to Wolff and Bourgain-Demeter to prove $L^p$-boundedness of $M$ in an optimal range.;math.CA
1801.06982;Effective reduction for a nonlocal Zakai stochastic partial differential equation in data assimilation;We study the effective reduction for a nonlocal stochastic partial differential equation with oscillating coefficients. The nonlocal operator in this stochastic partial differential equation is the generator of non-Gaussian L\'{e}vy processes, with either \textbf{integrable} or \textbf{non-integrable} jump kernels. We examine the limiting behavior of this equation as a scaling parameter tends to zero, and derive a reduced (local or nonlocal) effective equation. In particular, this work leads to an effective reduction for a data assimilation system with L\'{e}vy noise, by examining the corresponding nonlocal Zakai stochastic partial differential equation. We show that the probability density for the reduced data assimilation system approximates that for the original system.;math.PR
1801.06988;Spin Geometry and Some Applications;In this review, basic definitions of spin geometry are given and some of its applications to supersymmetry, supergravity and condensed matter physics are summarized. Clifford algebras and spinors are defined and the first-order differential operators on spinors which lead to the definitions of twistor and Killing spinors are discussed. Holonomy classification for manifolds admitting parallel and Killing spinors are given. Killing-Yano and conformal Killing-Yano forms resulting from the spinor bilinears of Killing and twistor spinors are introduced and the symmetry operators of special spinor equations are constructed in terms of them. Spinor bilinears and symmetry operators are used for constructing the extended superalgebras from twistor and Killing spinors. A method to obtain harmonic spinors from twistor spinors and potential forms is given and its implications on finding solutions of the Seiberg-Witten equations are discussed. Supergravity Killing spinors defined in bosonic supergravity theories are considered and possible Lie algebra structures satisfied by their spinor bilinears are examined. Spin raising and lowering operators for massless field equations with different spins are constructed and the case for Rarita-Schwinger fields is investigated. The derivation of the periodic table of topological insulators and superconductors in terms of Clifford chessboard and index of Dirac operators is summarized.;math-ph
1801.06990;Fractional Powers of the Generating Function for the Partition Function;Let $p_{k}(n)$ be the coefficient of $q^n$ in the series expansion of $(q,q)_{\infty}^{k}$. It is known that the partition function $p(n)$, which corresponds to the case when $k=-1$, satisfies congruences such as $p(5n+4)\equiv 0\pmod{5}$. In this article, we discuss congruences satisfied by $p_{k}(n)$ when $k$ is a rational number.;math.NT
1801.06993;Asymptotics of Queue Length Distributions in Priority Retrial Queues;We calculate asymptotics of the distribution of the number of customers in orbit in a two-class priority retrial $M/G/1$-type queueing model. In this model, priority customers wait in line while non-priority customers join an orbit and retry later. Although the generating function and moments of the number of customers in orbit has been analyzed before, asymptotics of the distribution have not been thoroughly investigated. We use singularity analysis of the probability generating function to do just that. Our results show that different regimes exist for these asymptotics in case of light-tailed service times: in what we call the `priority regime', the tail asymptotics have the same decay ($\sim cn^{-3/2}R^{-n}$) as in the priority non-retrial queue and the retrial rate only influences the constant $c$. In the `retrial regime', the retrial rate also influences the sub-exponential factor of the asymptotics. In this regime, asymptotics are very similar to asymptotics in retrial queues without (priority) waiting line. Finally, we also analyze the case that the service time distribution is power law (with or without exponential cut-off) using the same technique.;math.PR
1801.06994;Estimates on volumes of homogeneous polynomial spaces;In this paper we develop the "local part" of our local/global approach to globally valued fields (GVFs). The "global part", which relies on these results, is developed in a subsequent paper.We study virtual divisors on projective varieties defined over a valued field $K$, as well as sub-valuations on polynomial rings over $K$ (analogous to homogeneous polynomial ideals). We prove a Nullstellensatz-style duality between projective varieties equipped with virtual divisors (analogous to projective varieties over a plain field) and certain sub-valuations on polynomial rings over $K$ (analogous to homogeneous polynomial ideals). Our main result compares the \emph{volume} of a virtual divisor on a variety $W$, namely its $(\dim W + 1)$-fold self-intersection, with the asymptotic behaviour of the volume of the dual sub-valuation, restricted to the space of polynomial functions of degree $m$, as $m \rightarrow \infty$.;math.AG
1801.06999;Expected number of nodal components for cut-off fractional Gaussian fields;Let $({\mathcal{X}},g)$ be a closed Riemmanian manifold of dimension $n&gt,0$. Let $\Delta$ be the Laplacian on ${\mathcal{X}}$, and let $(e\_k)\_k$ be an $L^2$-orthonormal and dense family of Laplace eigenfunctions with respective eigenvalues $(\lambda\_k)\_k$. We assume that $(\lambda\_k)\_k$ is non-decreasing and that the $e\_k$ are real-valued. Let $(\xi\_k)\_k$ be a sequence of iid $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ random variables. For each $L&gt,0$ and $s\in{\mathbb{R}}$, possibly negative, set\[f^s\_L=\sum\_{0&lt,\lambda\_j\leq L}\lambda\_j^{-\frac{s}{2}}\xi\_je\_j\, .\]Then, $f\_L^s$ is almost surely regular on its zero set. Let $N\_L$ be the number of connected components of its zero set. If $s&lt,\frac{n}{2}$, then we deduce that there exists $\nu=\nu(n,s)&gt,0$ such that $N\_L\sim \nu {Vol}\_g({\mathcal{X}})L^{n/2}$ in $L^1$ and almost surely. In particular, ${\mathbb{E}}[N\_L]\asymp L^{n/2}$. On the other hand, we prove that if $s=\frac{n}{2}$ then\[{\mathbb{E}}[N\_L]\asymp \frac{L^{n/2}}{\sqrt{\ln\left(L^{1/2}\right)}}\, .\]In the latter case, we also obtain an upper bound for the expected Euler characteristic of the zero set of $f\_L^s$ and for its Betti numbers. In the case $s&gt,n/2$, the pointwise variance of $f\_L^s$ converges so it is not expected to have universal behavior as $L\rightarrow+\infty$.;math.PR
1801.07002;Clifford algebras as twisted group algebras and the Arf invariant;Some connections between quadratic forms over the field of two elements, Clifford algebras of quadratic forms over the real numbers, real graded division algebras, and twisted group algebras will be highlighted. This allows to revisit real Clifford algebras in terms of the Arf invariant of the associated quadratic forms over the field of two elements, and give new proofs of some classical results.;math.RA
1801.07003;Structural Properties of Twisted Reed-Solomon Codes with Applications to Cryptography;We present a generalisation of Twisted Reed-Solomon codes containing a new large class of MDS codes. We prove that the code class contains a large subfamily that is closed under duality. Furthermore, we study the Schur squares of the new codes and show that their dimension is often large. Using these structural properties, we single out a subfamily of the new codes which could be considered for code-based cryptography: These codes resist some existing structural attacks for Reed-Solomon-like codes, i.e. methods for retrieving the code parameters from an obfuscated generator matrix.;cs.IT
1801.07006;Improved Power Decoding of Interleaved One-Point Hermitian Codes;We propose a new partial decoding algorithm for $h$-interleaved one-point Hermitian codes that can decode-under certain assumptions-an error of relative weight up to $1-(\tfrac{k+g}{n})^{\frac{h}{h+1}}$, where $k$ is the dimension, $n$ the length, and $g$ the genus of the code. Simulation results for various parameters indicate that the new decoder achieves this maximal decoding radius with high probability. The algorithm is based on a recent generalization of Rosenkilde's improved power decoder to interleaved Reed-Solomon codes, does not require an expensive root-finding step, and improves upon the previous best decoding radius by Kampf at all rates. In the special case $h=1$, we obtain an adaption of the improved power decoding algorithm to one-point Hermitian codes, which for all simulated parameters achieves a similar observed failure probability as the Guruswami-Sudan decoder above the latter's guaranteed decoding radius.;cs.IT
1801.07007;New groups and invariants of classical braids valued in $G_{n}^{2}$;The aim of the present note is to enhance groups $G_{n}^{3}$ and to construct new invariants of classical braids. In particular, we construct invariants valued in $G_{N}^{2}$ groups. In groups $G_{n}^{2}$, the identity problem is solved, besides, their structure is much simpler than that of $G_{n}^{3}$.;math.GT
1801.07010;Discrete fractional integral operators with binary quadratic forms as phase polynomials;We give estimates on discrete fractional integral operators along binary quadratic forms. These operators have been studied for 30 years starting with the investigations of Arkhipov and Oskolkov, but efforts have concentrated on cases where the phase polynomial is translation invariant or quasi-translation invariant. This work presents the first results for operators with neither translation invariant nor quasi-translation invariant phase polynomials.;math.CA

Furthermore, we explicitly describe three classes of simple closed geodesics on regular tetrahedra in the hyperbolic 3-space. These are so-called 2-homogeneous, 3-homogeneous and (3,2)-homogeneous geodesics. Up to a rigid motion of a tetrahedron there exists a unique geodesic in each class.;math.MG
1801.07021;Riordan graphs II: Spectral properties;The authors of this paper have used the theory of Riordan matrices to introduce the notion of a Riordan graph in \cite{CJKM}. Riordan graphs are proved to have a number of interesting (fractal) properties, and they are a far-reaching generalization of the well known and well studied Pascal graphs and Toeplitz graphs, and also some other families of graphs. The main focus in \cite{CJKM} is the study of structural properties of families of Riordan graphs obtained from certain infinite Riordan graphs. <br />In this paper, we use a number of results in~\cite{CJKM} to study spectral properties of Riordan graphs. Our studies include, but are not limited to the spectral graph invariants for Riordan graphs such as the adjacency eigenvalues, (signless) Laplacian eigenvalues, nullity, positive and negative inertias, and rank. We also study determinants of Riordan graphs, in particular, giving results about determinants of Catalan graphs.;math.CO
1801.07024;Population invasion with bistable dynamics and adaptive evolution: the evolutionary rescue;We consider the system of reaction-diffusion equations proposed in [8] as a population dynamics model. The first equation stands for the population density and models the ecological effects, namely dispersion and growth with a Allee effect (bistable nonlinearity). The second one stands for the Allee threshold, seen as a trait mean, and accounts for evolutionary effects. Precisely, the Allee threshold is submitted to three main effects: dispersion (mirroring ecology), asymmetrical gene flow and selection. The strength of the latter depends on the population density and is thus coupling ecology and evolution. Our main result is to mathematically prove evolutionary rescue: any small initial population, that would become extinct in the sole ecological context, will persist and spread thanks to evolutionary factors.;math.AP
1801.07025;Spanning trees without adjacent vertices of degree 2;Albertson, Berman, Hutchinson, and Thomassen showed in 1990 that there exist highly connected graphs in which every spanning tree contains vertices of degree 2. Using a result of Alon and Wormald, we show that there exists a natural number $d$ such that every graph of minimum degree at least $d$ contains a spanning tree without adjacent vertices of degree 2. Moreover, we prove that every graph with minimum degree at least 3 has a spanning tree without three consecutive vertices of degree 2.;math.CO

Resch prove that the list decodability of $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear rank metric codes is as good as that of random rank metric codes in~\cite{venkat2017}. Due to the potential applications of self-orthogonal rank metric codes, we focus on list decoding of them. In this paper, we prove that with high probability, an $\F_q$-linear self-orthogonal rank metric code over $\mathbb{F}_q^{n\times m}$ of rate $R=(1-\tau)(1-\frac{n}{m}\tau)-\epsilon$ is shown to be list decodable up to fractional radius $\tau\in(0,1)$ and small $\epsilon\in(0,1)$ with list size depending on $\tau$ and $q$ at most $O_{\tau, q}(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$. In addition, we show that an $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$-linear self-orthogonal rank metric code of rate up to the Gilbert-Varshamov bound is $(\tau n, \exp(O_{\tau, q}(\frac{1}{\epsilon})))$-list decodable.;cs.IT
1801.07034;On syzygies of Segre embeddings of $P^1\times P^1$;We construct a nonminimal graded free resolution of Segre embeddings of $P^1\times P^1$, although we don't compute all maps. We use this to prove an explicit formula for certain nonzero entries in the graded Betti table, at the end of the first row. We work over an arbitrary field $k$.;math.AG
1801.07036;Free boundary minimal hypersurfaces with least area;In this paper, we prove the existence of the free boundary minimal hypersurface of least area in compact manifolds with boundary. Such hypersurface can be viewed as the ground state of the volume spectrum introduced by Gromov. Moreover, we characterize the orientation and Morse index of them.;math.DG
1801.07037;Rota---Baxter Operators on Quadratic Algebras;We prove that all Rota---Baxter operators on a quadratic division algebra are trivial. For nonzero weight, we state that all Rota---Baxter operators on the simple odd-dimensional Jordan algebra of bilinear form are projections on a subalgebra along another one. For weight zero, we find a connection between the Rota---Baxter operators and the solutions to the alternative Yang---Baxter equation on the Cayley---Dickson algebra. We also investigate the Rota---Baxter operators on the matrix algebras of order two, the Grassmann algebra of plane, and the Kaplansky superalgebra.;math.RA
1801.07038;A coding theoretic approach to the uniqueness conjecture for projective planes of prime order;An outstanding folklore conjecture asserts that, for any prime $p$, up to isomorphism the projective plane $PG(2,\mathbb{F}_p)$ over the field $\mathbb{F}_p := \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ is the unique projective plane of order $p$. Let $\pi$ be any projective plane of order $p$. For any partial linear space ${\cal X}$, define the inclusion number $i({\cal X},\pi)$ to be the number of isomorphic copies of ${\cal X}$ in $\pi$. In this paper we prove that if ${\cal X}$ has at most $\log_2 p$ lines, then $i({\cal X},\pi)$ can be written as an explicit rational linear combination (depending only on ${\cal X}$ and $p$) of the coefficients of the complete weight enumerator (c.w.e.) of the $p$-ary code of $\pi$. Thus, the c.w.e. of this code carries an enormous amount of structural information about $\pi$. In consequence, it is shown that if $p &gt, 2^ 9=512$, and $\pi$ has the same c.w.e. as $PG(2,\mathbb{F}_p)$, then $\pi$ must be isomorphic to $PG(2,\mathbb{F}_p)$. Thus, the uniqueness conjecture can be approached via a thorough study of the possible c.w.e. of the codes of putative projective planes of prime order.;math.CO
1801.07040;Finiteness of polarized K3 surfaces and hyperk&#xe4,hler manifolds;In the moduli space of polarized varieties the same unpolarized variety can occur multiple times However, for K3 surfaces, compact hyperk\"ahler manifolds, and abelian varieties the number is finite. This may be viewed as a consequence of the Kawamata-Morrison cone conjecture. In this note we provide a proof of this finiteness not relying on the cone conjecture and, in fact, not even on the global Torelli theorem. Instead, it uses the geometry of the moduli space of polarized varieties to conclude the finiteness by means of Baily-Borel type arguments. We also address related questions concerning finiteness in twistor families associated with polarized K3 surfaces of CM type.;math.AG
1801.07041;Connection Formula for the Jackson Integral of Type $A_n$ and Elliptic Lagrange Interpolation;We investigate the connection problem for the Jackson integral of type $A_n$. Our connection formula implies a Slater type expansion of a bilateral multiple basic hypergeometric series as a linear combination of several specific multiple series. Introducing certain elliptic Lagrange interpolation functions, we determine the explicit form of the connection coefficients. We also use basic properties of the interpolation functions to establish an explicit determinant formula for a fundamental solution matrix of the associated system of $q$-difference equations.;math.CV
1801.07058;Poincar&#xe9, path integrals for elasticity;We propose a general strategy to derive null-homotopy operators for differential complexes based on the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand (BGG) construction and properties of the de Rham complex. Focusing on the elasticity complex, we derive path integral operators $\mathscr{P}$ for elasticity satisfying $\mathscr{D}\mathscr{P}+\mathscr{P}\mathscr{D}=\mathrm{id}$ and $\mathscr{P}^{2}=0$, where the differential operators $\mathscr{D}$ correspond to the linearized strain, the linearized curvature and the divergence, respectively. In general we derive path integral formulas in the presence of defects. As a special case, this gives the classical Ces\`{a}ro-Volterra path integral for strain tensors satisfying the Saint-Venant compatibility condition.;math-ph
1801.07059;Uniform asymptotic stability of a fractional tuberculosis model;We propose a Caputo type fractional-order mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis (TB). Uniform asymptotic stability of the unique endemic equilibrium of the fractional-order TB model is proved, for any $\alpha \in (0, 1)$. Numerical simulations for the stability of the endemic equilibrium are provided.;math.OC
1801.07062;The Flux Limited Keller-Segel System, Properties and Derivation from Kinetic Equations;The flux limited Keller-Segel (FLKS) system is a macroscopic model describing bacteria motion by chemotaxis which takes into account saturation of the velocity. The hyper-bolic form and some special parabolic forms have been derived from kinetic equations describing the run and tumble process for bacterial motion. The FLKS model also has the advantage that traveling pulse solutions exist as observed experimentally. It has attracted the attention of many authors recently. We design and prove a general derivation of the FLKS departing from a kinetic model under stiffness assumption of the chemotactic response and rescaling the kinetic equation according to this stiffness parameter. Unlike the classical Keller-Segel system, solutions of the FLKS system do not blow-up in finite or infinite time. Then we investigate the existence of radially symmetric steady state and long time behaviour of this flux limited Keller-Segel system.;math.AP

1801.07076;Data-Aided Secure Massive MIMO Transmission with Active Eavesdropping;In this paper, we study the design of secure communication for time division duplexing multi-cell multi-user massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with active eavesdropping. We assume that the eavesdropper actively attacks the uplink pilot transmission and the uplink data transmission before eavesdropping the downlink data transmission phase of the desired users. We exploit both the received pilots and data signals for uplink channel estimation. We show analytically that when the number of transmit antennas and the length of the data vector both tend to infinity, the signals of the desired user and the eavesdropper lie in different eigenspaces of the received signal matrix at the base station if their signal powers are different. This finding reveals that decreasing (instead of increasing) the desire user's signal power might be an effective approach to combat a strong active attack from an eavesdropper. Inspired by this result, we propose a data-aided secure downlink transmission scheme and derive an asymptotic achievable secrecy sum-rate expression for the proposed design. Numerical results indicate that under strong active attacks, the proposed design achieves significant secrecy rate gains compared to the conventional design employing matched filter precoding and artificial noise generation.;cs.IT
1801.07081;A Structural Analysis of Field/Circuit Coupled Problems Based on a Generalised Circuit Element;In some applications there arises the need of a spatially distributed description of a physical quantity inside a device coupled to a circuit. Then, the in-space discretised system of partial differential equations is coupled to the system of equations describing the circuit (Modified Nodal Analysis) which yields a system of Differential Algebraic Equations (DAEs). This paper deals with the differential index analysis of such coupled systems. For that, a new generalised inductance-like element is defined. The index of the DAEs obtained from a circuit containing such an element is then related to the topological characteristics of the circuit's underlying graph. Field/circuit coupling is performed when circuits are simulated containing elements described by Maxwell's equations. The index of such systems with two different types of magnetoquasistatic formulations (A* and T-$\Omega$) is then deduced by showing that the spatial discretisations in both cases lead to an inductance-like element.;math.NA
1801.07083;Differential Message Importance Measure: A New Approach to the Required Sampling Number in Big Data Structure Characterization;Data collection is a fundamental problem in the scenario of big data, where the size of sampling sets plays a very important role, especially in the characterization of data structure. This paper considers the information collection process by taking message importance into account, and gives a distribution-free criterion to determine how many samples are required in big data structure characterization. Similar to differential entropy, we define differential message importance measure (DMIM) as a measure of message importance for continuous random variable. The DMIM for many common densities is discussed, and high-precision approximate values for normal distribution are given. Moreover, it is proved that the change of DMIM can describe the gap between the distribution of a set of sample values and a theoretical distribution. In fact, the deviation of DMIM is equivalent to Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, but it offers a new way to characterize the distribution goodness-of-fit. Numerical results show some basic properties of DMIM and the accuracy of the proposed approximate values. Furthermore, it is also obtained that the empirical distribution approaches the real distribution with decreasing of the DMIM deviation, which contributes to the selection of suitable sampling points in actual system.;cs.IT
1801.07085;A Connection Between Time Domain Model Order Reduction and Moment Matching for LTI Systems;We investigate the time domain model order reduction (MOR) framework using general orthogonal polynomials by Jiang and Chen 2012 and extend their idea by exploiting the structure of the corresponding linear system of equations. Identifying an equivalent Sylvester equation, we show a connection to a rational Krylov subspace, and thus to moment matching. This theoretical link between the MOR techniques is illustrated by three numerical examples. For linear time-invariant systems, the link also motivates that the time domain approach can be at best as accurate as moment matching, since the expansion points are fixed by the choice of the polynomial basis, while in moment matching they can be adapted to the system.;math.NA

1801.07095;Mass transport in Fokker-Planck equations with tilted periodic potential;We consider Fokker-Planck equations with tilted periodic potential in the subcritical regime and characterize the spatio-temporal dynamics of the partial masses in the limit of vanishing diffusion. Our convergence proof relies on suitably defined substitute masses and bounds the approximation error using the energy-dissipation relation of the underlying Wasserstein gradient structure. In the appendix we also discuss the case of an asymmetric double-well potential and derive the corresponding limit dynamics in an elementary way.;math.AP
1801.07096;Generalized HARQ Protocols with Delayed Channel State Information and Average Latency Constraints;In many wireless systems, the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio that is applicable to a certain transmission, referred to as channel state information (CSI), can only be learned after the transmission has taken place and is thereby delayed (outdated). In such systems, hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) protocols are often used to achieve high throughput with low latency. This paper put forth the family of expandable message space (EMS) protocols that generalize the HARQ protocol and allow for rate adaptation based on delayed CSI at the transmitter (CSIT). Assuming a block-fading channel, the proposed EMS protocols are analyzed using dynamic programming. When full delayed CSIT is available and there is a constraint on the average decoding time, it is shown that the optimal zero outage EMS protocol has a particularly simple operational interpretation and that the throughput is identical to that of the backtrack retransmission request (BRQ) protocol. We also devise EMS protocols for the case in which CSIT is only available through a finite number of feedback messages. The numerical results demonstrate that the throughput of BRQ approaches the ergodic capacity quickly compared to HARQ, while EMS protocols with only three and four feedback messages achieve throughputs that are only slightly worse than that of BRQ.;cs.IT
1801.07097;Embedding 5-planar graphs in three pages;A \emph{book-embedding} of a graph $G$ is an embedding of vertices of $G$ along the spine of a book, and edges of $G$ on the pages so that no two edges on the same page intersect. the minimum number of pages in which a graph can be embedded is called the \emph{page number}. The book-embedding of graphs may be important in several technical applications, e.g., sorting with parallel stacks, fault-tolerant processor arrays design, and layout problems with application to very large scale integration (VLSI). Bernhart and Kainen firstly considered the book-embedding of the planar graph and conjectured that its page number can be made arbitrarily large [JCT, 1979, 320-331]. Heath [FOCS84] found that planar graphs admit a seven-page book embedding. Later, Yannakakis proved that four pages are necessary and sufficient for planar graphs in [STOC86]. Recently, Bekos et al. [STACS14] described an $O(n^{2})$ time algorithm of two-page book embedding for 4-planar graphs. In this paper, we embed 5-planar graphs into a book of three pages by an $O(n^{2})$ time algorithm.;math.CO
1801.07099;On Divergence-based Distance Functions for Multiply-connected Domains;Given a finitely-connected bounded planar domain $\Omega$, it is possible to define a {\it divergence distance} $D(x,y)$ from $x\in\Omega$ to $y\in\Omega$, which takes into account the complex geometry of the domain. This distance function is based on the concept of $f$-divergence, a distance measure traditionally used to measure the difference between two probability distributions. The relevant probability distributions in our case are the Poisson kernels of the domain at $x$ and at $y$. We prove that for the $\chi^2$-divergence distance, the gradient by $x$ of $D$ is opposite in direction to the gradient by $x$ of $G(x,y)$, the Green's function with pole $y$. Since $G$ is harmonic, this implies that $D$, like $G$, has a single extremum in $\Omega$, namely at $y$ where $D$ vanishes. Thus $D$ can be used to trace a gradient-descent path within~$\Omega$ from $x$ to $y$ by following $\nabla_x D(x,y)$, which has significant computational advantages over tracing the gradient of $G$. This result can be used for robotic path-planning in complex geometric environments.;math.CV
1801.07100;Moduli of Lagrangian immersions with formal deformations;We introduce a joint project with Cheol-Hyun Cho on the construction of quantum-corrected moduli of Lagrangian immersions. The construction has important applications to mirror symmetry for pair-of-pants decompositions, SYZ and wall-crossing. The key ingredient is Floer-theoretical gluing between local moduli spaces of Lagrangians with different topologies.;math.AG
1801.07103;Majoration of the dimension of the space of concatenated solutions of a specific pantograph equation;For each $\lambda \in \mathbb N^*$, we consider the integral equation: \[ \int_{\lambda y} ^{\lambda x} f(t)\, d t = f(x) - f(y) \mbox{ for every $(x,y)\in {\mathbb R}_+^2$,} \] where $f$ is the concatenation of two continuous functions $f_a,f_b:[0,\lambda] \rightarrow {\mathbb R}$ along a word $u= u_0u_1\cdots\in\{a,b\}^{\mathbb N}$ such that $u=\sigma(u)$, where $\sigma$ is a $\lambda$-uniform substitution satisfying some combinatorial conditions. <br />There exists some non-trivial solutions. We show in this work that the dimension of the set of solutions is at most two.;math.CO
1801.07105;Radial symmetry for p-harmonic functions in exterior and punctured domains;We prove symmetry for the p-capacitary potential satisfying $$ \Delta_p u = 0 \, \mbox{ in } \mathbb{R}^N \setminus \overline{\Omega} , \, u=1 \, \mbox{ on } \Gamma, \, \lim_{|x|\rightarrow \infty} u(x)=0 , \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, 1&lt,p&lt,N, $$ under Serrin's overdetermined condition $$ | \nabla u| = c \mbox{ on } \Gamma. $$ Here $\Omega$ is any bounded domain on which no a priori assumption is made, and $\Gamma$ denotes its boundary. Our result improves on a work of Garofalo and Sartori, where the same conclusion was obtained when $\Omega$ is star-shaped. Our proof uses the maximum principle for an appropriate $P$-function, some integral identities, the isoperimetric inequality, and a Soap Bubble-type Theorem. We then treat the case $1&lt,p=N$, improving previous results present in the literature. Finally, with analogous tools we give a new proof of symmetry for the interior overdetermined problem $$ - \Delta_p u = K \, \delta_0 \, \mbox{ in } \Omega , \, u=c \, \mbox{ on } \Gamma, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, 1&lt,p&lt,N, $$ $$ | \nabla u| = 1 \mbox{ on } \Gamma , $$ in a bounded star-shaped domain $\Omega$.;math.AP
1801.07114;Global Deterministic Optimization with Artificial Neural Networks Embedded;Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used in various applications for data-driven black-box modeling and subsequent optimization. Herein, we present an efficient method for deterministic global optimization of ANN embedded optimization problems. The proposed method is based on relaxations of algorithms using McCormick relaxations in a reduced-space [\textit{SIOPT}, 20 (2009), pp. 573-601] including the convex and concave envelopes of the nonlinear activation function of ANNs. The optimization problem is solved using our in-house global deterministic solver MAiNGO. The performance of the proposed method is shown in four optimization examples: an illustrative function, a fermentation process, a compressor plant and a chemical process optimization. The results show that computational solution time is favorable compared to the global general-purpose optimization solver BARON.;math.OC
1801.07118;On the Hausdorff Dimension of Bernoulli Convolutions;We give an expression for the Garsia entropy of Bernoulli convolutions in terms of products of matrices. This gives an explicit rate of convergence of the Garsia entropy and shows that one can calculate the Hausdorff dimension of the Bernoulli convolution $\nu_\beta$ to arbitrary given accuracy whenever $\beta$ is algebraic. In particular, if the Garsia entropy $H(\beta)$ is not equal to $\log(\beta)$ then we have a finite time algorithm to determine whether or not $\mathrm{dim}_\mathrm{H} (\nu_\beta)=1$.;math.CA
1801.07120;Counting subrings of the ring $\Bbb{Z}_m \times \Bbb{Z}_n$;Let $m,n\in \Bbb{N}$. We represent the additive subgroups of the ring $\Bbb{Z}_m \times \Bbb{Z}_n$, which are also (unital) subrings, and deduce explicit formulas for $N^{(s)}(m,n)$ and $N^{(us)}(m,n)$, denoting the number of subrings of the ring $\Bbb{Z}_m \times \Bbb{Z}_n$ and its unital subrings, respectively. We show that the functions $(m,n)\mapsto N^{(s)}(m,n)$ and $(m,n)\mapsto N^{(us)}(m,n)$ are multiplicative, viewed as functions of two variables, and their Dirichlet series can be expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function. We also establish an asymptotic formula for the sum $\sum_{m,n\le x} N^{(s)}(m,n)$, the error term of which is closely related to the Dirichlet divisor problem.;math.NT
1801.07122;Expressing the curvature tensor and connection of a given metric in terms of those of another metric;Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold, and $m$ be a second metric on $M$. We give expressions of $m$'s associated connection, and Riemann curvature tensor $R_m$, in terms of $R_g$ and certain combinations of covariant derivatives of $m$ (with respect to the Levi-Civita connection associated with $g$). The formulas turn out to be generalizations of the coordinate expressions. Coordinate expression formulas can be recovered from ours by setting $g$ as the Euclidean metric induced by a given coordinate chart. As the covariant derivative induced by $g$ becomes the ordinary partial derivative and the $R_g$ tensor vanishes, the formulas coincide with the well-known coordinate expressions for $m$'s connection and curvature tensor.;math.DG
1801.07135;Maximising the number of solutions to a linear equation in a set of integers;Given a linear equation of the form $a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + a_3x_3 = 0$ with integer coefficients $a_i$, we are interested in maximising the number of solutions to this equation in a set $S \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$, for sets $S$ of a given size. <br />We prove that, for any choice of constants $a_1, a_2$ and $a_3$, the maximum number of solutions is at least $\left(\frac{1}{12} + o(1)\right)|S|^2$. Furthermore, we show that this is optimal, in the following sense. For any $\varepsilon &gt, 0,$ there are choices of $a_1, a_2$ and $a_3,$ for which any large set $S$ of integers has at most $\left(\frac{1}{12} + \varepsilon\right)|S|^2$ solutions. <br />For equations in $k \geq 3$ variables, we also show an analogous result. Set $\sigma_k = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (\frac{\sin \pi x}{\pi x})^k dx.$ Then, for any choice of constants $a_1, \dots, a_k$, there are sets $S$ with at least $(\frac{\sigma_k}{k^{k-1}} + o(1))|S|^{k-1}$ solutions to $a_1x_1 + \dots + a_kx_k = 0$. Moreover, there are choices of coefficients $a_1, \dots, a_k$ for which any large set $S$ must have no more than $(\frac{\sigma_k}{k^{k-1}} + \varepsilon)|S|^{k-1}$ solutions, for any $\varepsilon &gt, 0$.;math.CO
1801.07139;New variational and multisymplectic formulations of the Euler-Poincar&#xe9, equation on the Virasoro-Bott group using the inverse map;We derive a new variational principle, leading to a new momentum map and a new multisymplectic formulation for a family of Euler--Poincar\'e equations defined on the Virasoro-Bott group, by using the inverse map (also called `back-to-labels' map). This family contains as special cases the well-known Korteweg-de Vries, Camassa-Holm, and Hunter-Saxton soliton equations. In the conclusion section, we sketch opportunities for future work that would apply the new Clebsch momentum map with $2$-cocycles derived here to investigate a new type of interplay among nonlinearity, dispersion and noise.;math-ph
1801.07144;A gradient system with a wiggly energy and relaxed EDP-convergence;If gradient systems depend on a microstructure, we want to derive a macroscopic gradient structure describing the effective behavior of the microscopic effects. We introduce a notion of evolutionary Gamma-convergence that relates the microscopic energy and the microscopic dissipation potential with their macroscopic limits via Gamma-convergence. This new notion generalizes the concept of EDP-convergence, which was introduced in <a href="/abs/1507.06322">arXiv:1507.06322</a>, and is called "relaxed EDP-convergence". Both notions are based on De Giorgi's energy-dissipation principle, however the special structure of the dissipation functional in terms of the primal and dual dissipation potential is, in general, not preserved under Gamma-convergence. By investigating the kinetic relation directly and using general forcings we still derive a unique macroscopic dissipation potential. <br />The wiggly-energy model of James et al serves as a prototypical example where this nontrivial limit passage can be fully analyzed.;math.AP
1801.07147;Postulating the theory of experience and chance as a theory of co~events (co~beings);The paper aim is the axiomatic justification of the theory of experience and chance, one of the dual halves of which is the Kolmogorov probability theory. The author's main idea was the natural inclusion of Kolmogorov's axiomatics of probability theory in a number of general concepts of the theory of experience and chance. The analogy between the measure of a set and the probability of an event has become clear for a long time. This analogy also allows further evolution: the measure of a set is completely analogous to the believability of an event. In order to postulate the theory of experience and chance on the basis of this analogy, you just need to add to the Kolmogorov probability theory its dual reflection - the believability theory, so that the theory of experience and chance could be postulated as the certainty (believability-probability) theory on the Cartesian product of the probability and believability spaces, and the central concept of the theory is the new notion of co~event as a measurable binary relation on the Cartesian product of sets of elementary incomes and elementary outcomes. Attempts to build the foundations of the theory of experience and chance from this general point of view are unknown to me, and the whole range of ideas presented here has not yet acquired popularity even in a narrow circle of specialists, in addition, there was still no complete system of the postulates of the theory of experience and chance free from unnecessary complications. The main result of this work is the axiom of co~event, intended for the sake of constructing a theory formed by dual theories of believabilities and probabilities, each of which itself is postulated by its own Kolmogorov system of axioms. Here a preference is given to a system of postulates that is able to describe in a simple manner the results of what I call an experienced-random experiment.;math.GM
1801.07148;Robust numerical methods for nonlocal (and local) equations of porous medium type. Part I: Theory;We develop a unified and easy to use framework to study robust fully discrete numerical methods for nonlinear degenerate diffusion equations $$ \partial_t u-\mathfrak{L}^{\sigma,\mu}[\varphi(u)]=f \quad\quad\text{in}\quad\quad \mathbb{R}^N\times(0,T), $$ where $\mathfrak{L}^{\sigma,\mu}$ is a general symmetric diffusion operator of L\'evy type and $\varphi$ is merely continuous and non-decreasing. We then use this theory to prove convergence for many different numerical schemes. In the nonlocal case most of the results are completely new. Our theory covers strongly degenerate Stefan problems, the full range of porous medium equations, and for the first time for nonlocal problems, also fast diffusion equations. Examples of diffusion operators $\mathfrak{L}^{\sigma,\mu}$ are the (fractional) Laplacians $\Delta$ and $-(-\Delta)^{\frac\alpha2}$ for $\alpha\in(0,2)$, discrete operators, and combinations. The observation that monotone finite difference operators are nonlocal L\'evy operators, allows us to give a unified and compact {\em nonlocal} theory for both local and nonlocal, linear and nonlinear diffusion equations. The theory includes stability, compactness, and convergence of the methods under minimal assumptions -- including assumptions that lead to very irregular solutions. As a byproduct, we prove the new and general existence result announced in \cite{DTEnJa17b}. We also present some numerical tests, but extensive testing is deferred to the companion paper \cite{DTEnJa18b} along with a more detailed discussion of the numerical methods included in our theory.;math.NA
1801.07149;Distal and non-Distal Behavior in Pairs;The aim of this work is an analysis of distal and non-distal behavior in dense pairs of o-minimal structures. A characterization of distal types is given through orthogonality to a generic type in $M^{\operatorname{eq}}$, non-distality is geometrically analyzed through Keisler measures, and a distal expansion for the case of pairs of ordered vector spaces is computed.;math.LO
1801.07152;A central limit theorem for functions of stationary max-stable random fields on $\mathbb{R}^d$;Max-stable random fields are very appropriate for the statistical modelling of spatial extremes. Hence, integrals of functions of max-stable random fields over a given region can play a key role in the assessment of the risk of natural disasters, meaning that it is relevant to improve our understanding of their probabilistic behaviour. For this purpose, in this paper, we propose a general central limit theorem for functions of stationary max-stable random fields on $\mathbb{R}^d$. Then, we show that appropriate functions of the Brown-Resnick random field with a power variogram and of the Smith random field satisfy the central limit theorem. Another strong motivation for our work lies in the fact that central limit theorems for random fields on $\mathbb{R}^d$ have been barely considered in the literature. As an application, we briefly show the usefulness of our results in a risk assessment context.;math.PR
1801.07153;Ballistic transport in the classical Toda chain with harmonic pinning;We investigate, via numerical simulation, heat transport in the nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS) of the 1D classical Toda chain with an additional pinning potential, which destroys momentum conservation. The NESS is produced by coupling the system, via Langevin dynamics, to two reservoirs at different temperatures. To our surprise, we find that when the pinning is harmonic, the transport is ballistic. We also find that on a periodic ring with nonequilibrium initial conditions and no reservoirs, the energy current oscillates without decay. Lastly, Poincar\'e sections of the 3-body case indicate that for all tested initial conditions, the dynamics occur on a 3-dimensional manifold. These observations suggest that the $N$-body Toda chain with harmonic pinning may be integrable. Alternatively, and more likely, this would be an example of a nonintegrable system without momentum conservation for which the heat flux is ballistic - contrary to all current expectations.;math-ph
1801.07155;Continued fractions and orderings on the Markov numbers;Markov numbers are integers that appear in the solution triples of the Diophantine equation, $x^2+y^2+z^2=3xyz$, called the Markov equation. A classical topic in number theory, these numbers are related to many areas of mathematics such as combinatorics, hyperbolic geometry, approximation theory and cluster algebras. <br />There is a natural map from the rational numbers between zero and one to the Markov numbers. In this paper, we prove two conjectures seen in Martin Aigner's book, Markov's theorem and 100 years of the uniqueness conjecture, that determine an ordering on subsets of the Markov numbers based on their corresponding rational. <br />The proof relies on a relationship between Markov numbers and continuant polynomials which originates in Frobenius' 1913 paper.;math.CO
1801.07157;The topology of arrangements of ideal type;In 1962, Fadell and Neuwirth showed that the configuration space of the braid arrangement is aspherical. Having generalized this to many real reflection groups, Brieskorn conjectured this for all finite Coxeter groups. This in turn follows from Deligne's seminal work from 1972, where he showed that the complexification of every real simplicial arrangement is a $K(\pi,1)$-arrangement. <br />In this paper we study the $K(\pi,1)$-property for a certain class of subarrangements of Weyl arrangements, the so called arrangements of ideal type ${\mathscr A}_I$. These stem from ideals $I$ in the set of positive roots of a reduced root system. We show that the $K(\pi,1)$-property holds for all arrangements ${\mathscr A}_I$ if the underlying Weyl group is classical and that it extends to most of the ${\mathscr A}_I$ if the underlying Weyl group is of exceptional type. Conjecturally this holds for all ${\mathscr A}_I$. In general, the ${\mathscr A}_I$ are neither simplicial, nor is their complexification fiber type.;math.AT
1801.07158;On braided, banded surfaces and ribbon obstructions;We discuss how to apply work of L. Rudolph to braid conjugacy class invariants to obtain potentially effective obstructions to a slice knot being ribbon. We then apply these ideas to a family of braid conjugacy class invariants coming from Khovanov-Lee theory and explain why we do not obtain effective ribbon obstructions in this case.;math.GT
1801.07160;A Finite Difference Method on Quasi-uniform Mesh for Time-Fractional Advection-Diffusion Equations with Source Term;The present paper deals with the numerical solution of time-fractional advection-diffusion equations involving the Caputo derivative with source term by means of an unconditionally stable implicit finite difference method on quasi-uniform grids. We use a special quasi-uniform mesh in order to improve the numerical accuracy of the classical discrete fractional formula for the Caputo derivative. The stability and the convergence of the method are discussed. The error estimates established for a quasi-uniform grid and a uniform one are reported to support the theoretical results. Numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.;math.NA
1801.07162;I-favorable spaces:Revisited;The aim of this paper is to extend the external characterization of I-favorable spaces. This allows us to obtain a characterization of compact I-favorable spaces in terms of quasi k-metrics. We also provide proofs of some author's results announced in [14].;math.GN
1801.07163;The Eulerian distribution on the involutions of the hyperoctahedral group is unimodal;The Eulerian distribution on the involutions of the symmetric group is unimodal, as shown by Guo and Zeng. In this paper we prove that the Eulerian distribution on the involutions of the hyperoctahedral group, when viewed as a colored permutation group, is unimodal in a similar way and we compute its generating function, using signed quasisymmetric functions.;math.CO
1801.07169;Global Spherical Symmetric Flows for a Viscous Radiative and Reactive Gas in an Exterior Domain with Large Initial Data;In this paper, we study the global existence, uniqueness and large-time behavior of spherically symmetric solution of a viscous radiative and reactive gas in an unbounded domain exterior to the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n\geq 2$. The key point in the analysis is to deduce certain uniform estimates on the solutions, especially on the uniform positive lower and upper bounds on the specific volume and the temperature.;math.AP
1801.07171;Polygonal rotopulsators of the curved $n$-body problem;We revisit polygonal positive elliptic rotopulsator solutions and polygonal negative elliptic rotopulsator solutions of the $n$-body problem in $\mathbb{H}^{3}$ and $\mathbb{S}^{3}$ and prove existence of these solutions, prove that the masses of these rotopulsators have to be equal if the rotopulsators are of nonconstant size and show that the number of negative elliptic relative equilibria of this type is finite, as is the number of positive elliptic relative equilibria if an upper bound on the size of the relative equilibrium is imposed. Additionally, we prove that a class of negative hyperbolic rotopulsators is in fact a subclass of the class of polygonal negative elliptic rotopulsators.;math.DS
1801.07173;Abelian capitulation of ray class groups;Building on Bosca's method, we extend to tame ray class groups the results on capitulation of ideals of a number field by composition with abelian extensions of a subfield first studied by Gras. More precisely, for every extension of number fields K/k, where at least one infinite place splits completely, and every squarefree divisor m of K, we prove that there exist infinitely many abelian extensions F/k such that the ray class group mod m of K capitulates in KF. As a consequence we generalize to tame ray class groups the results of Kurihara on triviality of class groups for maximal abelian pro-extensions of totally real number fields.;math.NT
1801.07176;Principalization of logarithmic class groups;We extend to logarithmic class groups the results on abelian principalization of tame ray class groups of a number field obtained in a previous article.;math.NT
1801.07179;On certain multiples of Littlewood and Newman polynomials;Polynomials with all the coefficients in $\{ 0,1\}$ and constant term 1 are called Newman polynomials, whereas polynomials with all the coefficients in $\{ -1,1\}$ are called Littlewood polynomials. By exploiting an algorithm developed earlier, we determine the set of Littlewood polynomials of degree at most 12 which divide Newman polynomials. Moreover, we show that every Newman quadrinomial $X^a+X^b+X^c+1$, $15&gt,a&gt,b&gt,c&gt,0$, has a Littlewood multiple of smallest possible degree which can be as large as $32765$.;math.NT
1801.07181;Super Bundles;In this paper we give a brief account of the main aspects of the theory of associated and principal super bundles. As an application, we review the Borel-Weil-Bott Theorem in the super setting, and some results on projective embeddings of homogeneous spaces.;math.RT
1801.07182;Runge-Kutta symmetric interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin methods for modified Buckley-Leverett equations;We present a robust and accurate numerical method to solve the modified Buckley-Leverett equation in two-phase porous media flow with dynamic capillary pressure effect. A symmetric interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin method is used to discretize the equation in the space direction. For accuracy and stability issues, the third-order strong stability preserving implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta method is adopted to solve the nonlinear semi-discrete system: the linear diffusion term is discretized implicitly while the nonlinear flux term is discretized explicitly. The spatial accuracy of the discontinuous Galerkin method depends on the limiters applied to the solution: we test a minmod-TVB limiter, a simple WENO limiter and a high-order shock-capturing moment limiter to demonstrate that a suitable shock capturing moment limiter leads to more accurate approximation of solution. A set of representative numerical experiments are presented to show the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach. The results indicate that the moment limiter proposed by Moe et al. [Arxiv:<a href="/abs/1507.03024">1507.03024</a>, 2015] is the most suitable one to be used in solving the modified Buckley- Leverett equation, and high order schemes perform much better than lower order schemes. Our simulation results are consistent with the previous results in Kao et al.[J. Sci. Comput., 64(3) (2015), 837-857], Zhang and Zegeling [J. Comput. Phys., 345 (2017), 510-527 and Commun. Comput. Phys., 22(4) (2017), 935-964].;math.NA
1801.07186;A short nonalgorithmic proof of the containers theorem for hypergraphs;Recently the breakthrough method of hypergraph containers, developed independently by Balogh, Morris, and Samotij as well as Saxton and Thomason, has been used to study sparse random analogs of a variety of classical problems from combinatorics and number theory. The previously known proofs of the containers theorem use the so-called scythe algorithm---an iterative procedure that runs through the vertices of the hypergraph. (Saxton and Thomason have also proposed an alternative, randomized construction in the case of simple hypergraphs.) Here we present the first known deterministic proof of the containers theorem that is not algorithmic, i.e., it does not involve an iterative process. Our proof is less than 4 pages long while being entirely self-contained and conceptually transparent. Although our proof is completely elementary, it was inspired by considering hypergraphs in the setting of nonstandard analysis, where there is a notion of dimension capturing the logarithmic rate of growth of finite sets. Before presenting the proof in full detail, we include a one-page informal outline that refers to this notion of dimension and summarizes the essence of the argument.;math.CO
1801.07188;Resource Allocation for Solar Powered UAV Communication Systems;In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation design for multicarrier (MC) systems employing a solar powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for providing communication services to multiple downlink users. We study the joint design of the three-dimensional positioning of the UAV and the power and subcarrier allocation for maximization of the system sum throughput. The algorithm design is formulated as a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem, which requires a prohibitive computational complexity for obtaining the globally optimal solution. Therefore, a low-complexity suboptimal iterative solution based on successive convex approximation is proposed. Simulation results confirm that the proposed suboptimal algorithm achieves a substantially higher system sum throughput compared to several baseline schemes.;cs.IT
1801.07191;Vector lattice covers of ideals and bands in pre-Riesz spaces;Pre-Riesz spaces are ordered vector spaces which can be order densely embedded into vector lattices, their so-called vector lattice covers. Given a vector lattice cover $Y$ for a pre-Riesz space $X$, we address the question how to find vector lattice covers for subspaces of $X$, such as ideals and bands. We provide conditions such that for a directed ideal $I$ in $X$ its smallest extension ideal in $Y$ is a vector lattice cover. We show a criterion for bands in $X$ and their extension bands in $Y$ as well. Moreover, we state properties of ideals and bands in $X$ which are generated by sets, and of their extensions in $Y$.;math.FA
1801.07196;Euclidean submanifolds with incompressible canonical vector field;For a submanifold M in a Euclidean space, the tangential component x^T of the position vector field x of M is the most natural vector field tangent to the Euclidean submanifold, called the canonical vector field of M. In this article, first we prove that the canonical vector field of every Euclidean submanifold is always conservative. Then we initiate the study of Euclidean submanifolds with incompressible canonical vector fields. In particular, we obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for the canonical vector field of a Euclidean submanifold to be incompressible. Further, we provide examples of Euclidean submanifolds with incompressible canonical vector field. Moreover, we classify planar curves, surfaces of revolution and hypercylinders with incompressible canonical vector fields.;math.DG
1801.07197;Probabilistically nilpotent groups;We show that, for a finitely generated residually finite group $\Gamma$, the word $[x_1, \ldots, x_k]$ is a probabilistic identity of $\Gamma$ if and only if $\Gamma$ is virtually nilpotent of class less than $k$. Related results, generalizations and problems are also discussed.;math.GR
1801.07200;Blob algebra approach to modular representation theory;Two decades ago P. Martin and D. Woodcock made a surprising and prophetic link between statistical mechanics and representation theory. They observed that the decomposition numbers of the blob algebra (that appeared in the context of transfer matrix algebras) are Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials in type $\tilde{A}_1$. In this paper we take that observation far beyond its original scope. We conjecture that for $\tilde{A}_n$ there is an equivalence of categories between the characteristic $p$ diagrammatic Hecke category and a "blob category" that we introduce (using certain quotients of KLR algebras called \emph{generalized blob algebras}). Using alcove geometry we prove the "graded degree" part of this equivalence for all $n$ and all prime numbers $p$. If our conjecture was verified, it would imply that the graded decomposition numbers of the generalized blob algebras in characteristic $p$ give the $p$-Kazhdan Lusztig polynomials in type $\tilde{A}_n$. We prove this for $\tilde{A}_1$, the only case where the $p$-Kazhdan Lusztig polynomials are known.;math.RT
1801.07205;Optimal control problem for systems of conservation laws, with geometric parameter, and application to the Shallow-Water Equations;A theoretical framework and numerical techniques to solve optimal control problems with a spatial trace term in the terminal cost and governed by regularized nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws are provided. Depending on the spatial dimension, the set at which the optimum of the trace term is reached under the action of the control function can be a point, a curve or a hypersurface. The set is determined by geometric parameters. Theoretically the lack of a convenient functional framework in the context of optimal control for hyperbolic systems leads us to consider a parabolic regularization for the state equation, in order to derive optimality conditions. For deriving these conditions, we use a change of variables encoding the sensitivity with respect to the geometric parameters. As illustration, we consider the shallow-water equations with the objective of maximizing the height of the wave at the final time, a wave whose location and shape are optimized via the geometric parameters. Numerical results are obtained in 1D and 2D, using finite difference schemes, combined with an immersed boundary method for iterating the geometric parameters.;math.OC
1801.07206;Pseudo-backstepping and its application to the control of Korteweg-de Vries equation from the right endpoint on a finite domain;In this paper, we design Dirichlet-Neumann boundary feedback controllers for the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation that act at the right endpoint of the domain. The length of the domain is allowed to be critical. Constructing backstepping controllers that act at the right endpoint of the domain is more challenging than its left endpoint counterpart. The standard application of the backstepping method fails, because corresponding kernel models become overdetermined. In order to deal with this difficulty, we introduce the pseudo-backstepping method, which uses a pseudo-kernel that satisfies all but one desirable boundary condition. Moreover, various norms of the pseudo-kernel can be controlled through a parameter in one of its boundary conditions. We prove that the boundary controllers constructed via this pseudo-kernel still exponentially stabilize the system with the cost of a low exponential rate of decay. We show that a single Dirichlet controller is sufficient for exponential stabilization with a slower rate of decay. We also consider a second order feedback law acting at the right Dirichlet boundary condition. We show that this approach works if the main equation includes only the third order term, while the same problem remains open if the main equation involves the first order and/or the nonlinear term(s). At the end of the paper, we give numerical simulations to illustrate the main result.;math.OC
1801.07209;MIMO Underlay Cognitive Radio: Optimized Power Allocation, Effective Number of Transmit Antennas and Harvest-Transmit Tradeoff;In this paper, the performance of an underlay multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cognitive radio system is analytically studied. In particular, the secondary transmitter operates in a spatial multiplexing transmission mode, while a zero-forcing detector is employed at the secondary receiver. Additionally, the secondary system is interfered by single-antenna primary users (PUs). To enhance the performance of secondary transmission, optimal power allocation is performed at the secondary transmitter with a constraint on the maximum allowable outage threshold specified by the PUs. Further, the effective number of secondary transmit antennas is specified based on the optimal power allocation for an arbitrary MIMO scale. Also, a lower bound on the ergodic channel capacity of the secondary system is derived in a closed-form expression. Afterwards, the scenario of a massive MIMO secondary system is thoroughly analyzed and evaluated, where the harvesting-enabled secondary transmission is studied. The optimal power allocation, the effective number of secondary transmit antennas, the efficient tradeoff between transmit-and-harvest secondary antennas, and the average channel capacity of the secondary system are analytically presented. Finally, extensive numerical and simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of our analysis, while some useful engineering insights are provided.;cs.IT
1801.07214;Endpoint results for the Riesz transform of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator;In this paper we introduce a new atomic Hardy space $X^1(\gamma)$ adapted to the Gauss measure $\gamma$, and prove the boundedness of the first order Riesz transform associated with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator from $X^1(\gamma)$ to $L^1(\gamma)$. We also provide a new, short and almost self-contained proof of its weak-type $(1,1)$.;math.FA
1801.07216;A maximum principle for a stochastic control problem with multiple random terminal times;In the present paper we derive, via a backward induction technique, and ad hoc maximum principle for an optimal control problem with multiple random terminal times. Therefore we apply the aforementioned result to the case of a linear quadratic controller, providing solutions for the optimal control in terms of Riccati backward SDE with random terminal time. Eventually all the above results are applied to a system of interconnected banks.;math.OC
1801.07218;Global Solution Strategies for the Network-Constrained Unit Commitment Problem with AC Transmission Constraints;We propose a novel global solution algorithm for the network-constrained unit commitment problem incorporating a nonlinear alternating current model of the transmission network, which is a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. Our algorithm is based on the multi-tree global optimization methodology, which iterates between a mixed-integer lower-bounding problem and a nonlinear upper-bounding problem. We exploit the mathematical structure of the unit commitment problem with AC power flow constraints (UC-AC) and leverage optimization-based bounds tightening, second-order cone relaxations, and piecewise outer approximations to guarantee a globally optimal solution at convergence. Numerical results on four benchmark problems illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, both in terms of convergence rate and solution quality.;math.OC
1801.07220;Entropy Based Risk Measures;Entropy is a measure of self-information which is used to quantify losses. Entropy was developed in thermodynamics, but is also used to compare probabilities based on their deviating information content. Corresponding model uncertainty is of particular interest in stochastic programming and its applications like mathematical finance, as complete information is not accessible or manageable in general. This paper extends and generalizes the Entropic Value-at-Risk by involving R\'enyi entropies. We provide explicit relations of different entropic risk measures, we elaborate their dual representations and present their relations explicitly. <br />We consider the largest spaces which allow studying the impact of information in detail and it is demonstrated that these do not depend on the information loss. The dual norms and Hahn-Banach functionals are characterized explicitly.;math.PR
1801.07223;On the existence of dichromatic single element lenses;Due to dispersion, light with different wavelengths, or colors, is refracted at different angles. Our purpose is to determine when is it possible to design a lens made of a single homogeneous material so that it refracts light superposition of two colors into a desired fixed final direction. Two problems are considered: one is when light emanates in a parallel beam and the other is when light emanates from a point source. For the first problem, and when the direction of the parallel beam is different from the final desired direction, we show that such a lens does not exist, otherwise we prove the solution is trivial, i.e., the lens is confined between two parallel planes. For the second problem we prove that is impossible to design such a lens when the desired final direction is not among the set of incident directions. Otherwise, solving an appropriate system of functional equations we show that a local solution exists.;math.AP
1801.07228;Scattering the geometry of weighted graphs;Given two weighted graphs $(X,b_k,m_k)$, $k=1,2$ with $b_1\sim b_2$ and $m_1\sim m_2$, we prove a weighted $L^1$-criterion for the existence and completeness of the wave operators $ W_{\pm}(H_{2},H_1, I_{1,2})$, where $H_k$ denotes the natural Laplacian in $\ell^2(X,m_k)$ w.r.t. $(X,b_k,m_k)$ and $I_{1,2}$ the trivial identification of $\ell^2(X,m_1)$ with $\ell^2(X,m_2)$. In particular, this entails a very general criterion for the absolutely continuous spectra of $H_1$ and $H_2$ to be equal.;math-ph
1801.07235;The cylinder of a relation and generalized versions of the Nerve Theorem;We introduce the notion of cylinder of a relation in the context of posets, extending the construction of the mapping cylinder. We establish a local-to-global result for relations, generalizing Quillen's Theorem A for order preserving maps, and derive novel formulations of the classical Nerve Theorem for posets and simplicial complexes, suitable for covers with not necessarily contractible intersections.;math.AT
1801.07238;On a Helly-type question for central symmetry;We study a certain Helly-type question by Konrad Swanepoel. Assume that $X$ is a set of points such that every $k$-subset of $X$ is in centrally symmetric convex position, is it true that $X$ must also be in centrally symmetric convex position? It is easy to see that this is false if $k\le 5$, but it may be true for sufficiently large $k$. We investigate this question and give some partial results.;math.MG
1801.07242;Energy Bounds and Vanishing Results for the Gromov-Witten Invariants of the Projective Space;We describe generating functions for arbitrary-genus Gromov-Witten invariants of the projective space with any number of marked points explicitly. The structural portion of this description gives rise to uniform energy bounds and vanishing results for these invariants. They suggest deep conjectures relating Gromov-Witten invariants of symplectic manifolds to the energy of pseudo-holomorphic maps and the expected dimension of their moduli space.;math.AG
1801.07246;Distributed Frequency Offsets Estimation;In this paper, we provide a distributed frequency offset estimation algorithm based on a variant of belief propagation (BP). Each agent in the network pre-compensates its carrier frequency individually so that there is no frequency offset from the desired carrier frequency between each pair of transceiver. The pre-compensated offset for each agent is computed in a distributed fashion in order to be adaptive to the distributed network. The updating procedure of the variant of BP is designed in a broadcasting fashion to reduce communication burden. It is rigorously proved that the proposed algorithm is convergence guaranteed. Simulations show that this method achieves almost the optimal frequency compensation accuracy with an error approaching the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound.;cs.IT
1801.07248;Expansion of Iterated Stratonovich Stochastic Integrals of Multiplicity 2. Combined Approach, Based on Generalized Multiple and Iterated Fourier Series;The article is devoted to the expansion of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of multiplicity 2 on the base of the combined approach of generalized multiple and iterated Fourier series. We consider two different parts of the expansion of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals. The mean-square convergence of the first part is proven on the base of generalized multiple Fourier series, converging in the mean-square sense in the space $L_2([t, T]^2).$ The mean-square convergence of the second part is proven on the base of generalized double iterated Fourier series, converging pointwise. At that, we prove the iterated limit transition for the second part on the base of the classical theorems of mathematical analysis. The results of the article can be applied to numerical integration of Ito stochastic differential equations.;math.PR
1801.07270;An introduction to spin systems for mathematicians;We give a leisurely, albeit woefully incomplete, overview of quantum field theory, its relevance to condensed matter systems, and spin systems, which proceeds via a series of illustrative examples. The goal is to provide readers from the mathematics community a swift route into recent condensed matter literature that makes use of topological quantum field theory and ideas from stable homotopy theory to attack the problem of classification of topological (or SPT) phases of matter. The toric code and Heisenberg spin chain are briefly discussed, important conceptual ideas in physics, that may have somehow evaded discussion for those with purely mathematical training, are also reviewed. Emphasis is placed on the connection between (algebras of) nonlocal operators and the appearance of nontrivial TQFTs in the infrared.;math-ph
1801.07275;The phase space geometry underlying roaming reaction dynamics;Recent studies have found an unusual way of dissociation in formaldehyde. It can be characterized by a hydrogen atom that separates from the molecule, but instead of dissociating immediately it roams around the molecule for a considerable amount of time and extracts another hydrogen atom from the molecule prior to dissociation. This phenomenon has been coined roaming and has since been reported in the dissociation of a number of other molecules. In this paper we investigate roaming in Chesnavich's CH$_4^+$ model. During dissociation the free hydrogen must pass through three phase space bottleneck for the classical motion, that can be shown to exist due to unstable periodic orbits. None of these orbits is associated with saddle points of the potential energy surface and hence related to transition states in the usual sense. We explain how the intricate phase space geometry influences the shape and intersections of invariant manifolds that form separatrices, and establish the impact of these phase space structures on residence times and rotation numbers. Ultimately we use this knowledge to attribute the roaming phenomenon to particular heteroclinic intersections.;math.DS
1801.07276;C-projective symmetries of submanifolds in quaternionic geometry;The generalized Feix--Kaledin construction shows that c-projective $2n$-manifolds with curvature of type $(1,1)$ are precisely the submanifolds of quaternionic $4n$-manifolds which are fixed points set of a special type of quaternionic $S^1$ action $v$. In this paper, we consider this construction in the presence of infinitesimal symmetries of the two geometries. First, we prove that the submaximally symmetric c-projective model with type $(1,1)$ curvature is a submanifold of a submaximally symmetric quaternionic model, and show how this fits into the construction. We give conditions for when the c-projective symmetries extend from the fixed points set of $v$ to quaternionic symmetries, and we study the quaternionic symmetries of the Calabi-- and Eguchi-Hanson hyperk\"ahler structures, showing that in some cases all quaternionic symmetries are obtained in this way.;math.DG
1801.07293;A Proof of Symmetry of the Power Sum Polynomials using a Novel Bernoulli Numbers Identity;The problem of finding formulas for sums of powers of natural numbers has been of interest to mathematicians for many centuries. Among these is Faulhaber's well-known formula expressing the power sums as polynomials whose coefficients involve Bernoulli numbers. In this paper we give an elementary proof that the sum of $p$-th powers of the first $n$ natural numbers can be expressed as a polynomial in $n$ of degree $p+1$. We also prove a novel identity involving Bernoulli numbers and use it to show symmetry of this polynomial.;math.HO
1801.07294;Skorokhod decomposition for a reflected $\mathcal L^p$-strong Feller diffusions with singular drift;We construct Skorokhod decompositions for diffusions with singular drift and reflecting boundary behavior on open subsets of $\mathbb R^d$ with $C^2$-smooth boundary except for a sufficiently small set. This decomposition holds almost surely under the path measures of the process for every starting point from an explicitly known set. This set is characterized by the boundary smoothness and the singularities of the drift term. We apply modern methods of Dirichlet form theory and $\mathcal L^p$-strong Feller processes. These tools have been approved as useful for the pointwise analysis of stochastic processes with singular drift and various boundary conditions. Furthermore, we apply Sobolev space theorems and elliptic regularity results to prove regularity properties of potentials related to surface measures. These are important ingredients for the pointwise construction of the boundary local time of the diffusions under consideration. As an application we construct stochastic dynamics for particle systems with hydrodynamic and pair interaction. Our approach allows highly singular potentials like Lennard-Jones potentials and position-dependent diffusion coefficients and thus the treatment of physically reasonable models.;math.PR
1801.07296;Tensor algebras of product systems and their C*-envelopes;Let $(G, P)$ be an abelian, lattice ordered group and let $X$ be a compactly aligned product system over $P$. We show that the C*-envelope of the Nica tensor algebra $\mathcal{N}\mathcal{T}^+_X$ coincides with both Sehnem's covariance algebra $\mathcal{A} \times_X P$ and the co-universal C*-algebra $\mathcal{N}\mathcal{O}^r_X$ for injective, gauge compatible, Nica-covariant representations of Carlsen, Larsen, Sims and Vittadello. We give several applications of this result on both the selfadjoint and non-selfadjoint operator algebra theory. First we guarantee the existence of $\mathcal{N}\mathcal{O}^r_X$, thus settling a problem of Carlsen, Larsen, Sims and Vittadello which was open even for abelian, lattice ordered groups. As a second application, we resolve a problem posed by Skalski and Zacharias on dilating isometric representations of product systems to unitary representations. As a third application we characterize the C*-envelope of the tensor algebra of a finitely aligned higher-rank graph which also holds for topological higher-rank graphs. As a final application we prove reduced Hao-Ng isomorphisms for generalized gauge actions of discrete groups on C*-algebras of product systems. This generalizes recent results that were obtained by various authors in the case where $(G, P) =(\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{N})$.;math.OA
1801.07303;Local non-collapsing of volume for the Lagrangian mean curvature flow;We prove an optimal control on the time-dependent measure of a measurable set under a reparametrized Lagrangian mean curvature flow of almost calibrated submanifolds in a Calabi-Yau manifold. Moreover we give a classification of those Lagrangian translating solitons in $\mathbb{C}^m$ that evolve by this reparametrized flow;math.DG
1801.07304;Beta distributions and Sonine integrals for Bessel functions on symmetric cones;There exist several multivariate extensions of the classical Sonine integral representation for Bessel functions of some index $\mu+ \nu$ with respect to such functions of lower index $\mu.$ For Bessel functions on matrix cones, Sonine formulas involve beta densities $\beta_{\mu,\nu}$ on the cone and trace already back to Herz. The Sonine representations known so far on symmetric cones are restricted to continuous ranges $\Re\mu, \Re \nu &gt, \mu_0$, where the involved Beta densities are probability measures and the limiting index $\mu_0\geq 0$ depends on the rank of the cone. It is zero only in the one-dimensional case, but larger than zero in all multivariate cases. <br />In this paper, we study the extension of Sonine formulas for Bessel functions on symmetric cones to values of $\nu$ below the critical limit $\mu_0$. This is achieved by an analytic extension of the involved Beta measures as tempered distributions. Following recent ideas by A. Sokal for Riesz distributions on symmetric cones, we analyze for which indices the obtained Beta distributions are still measures. At the same time, we characterize the indices for which a Sonine formula between the related Bessel functions exists. As for Riesz distributions, there occur gaps in the admissible range of indices which are determined by the so-called Wallach set.;math.CA
1801.07305;Gorenstein projective and injective dimensions over Frobenius extensions;Let $R\subset A$ be a Frobenius extension of rings. We prove that: (1) for any left $A$-module $M$, $_{A}M$ is Gorenstein projective (injective) if and only if the underlying left $R$-module $_{R}M$ is Gorenstein projective (injective). (2) if $\mathrm{G}\text{-}\mathrm{proj.dim}_{A}M&lt,\infty$, then $\mathrm{G}\text{-}\mathrm{proj.dim}_{A}M = \mathrm{G}\text{-}\mathrm{proj.dim}_{R}M$, the dual for Gorenstein injective dimension also holds. (3) if the extension is split, then $\mathrm{G}\text{-}\mathrm{gldim}(A)= \mathrm{G}\text{-}\mathrm{gldim}(R)$.;math.KT
1801.07307;Fractional DP-Colorings of Sparse Graphs;DP-coloring (also known as correspondence coloring) is a generalization of list coloring developed recently by Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k and Postle. In this paper we introduce and study the fractional DP-chromatic number $\chi_{DP}^\ast(G)$. We characterize all connected graphs $G$ such that $\chi_{DP}^\ast(G) \leqslant 2$: they are precisely the graphs with no odd cycles and at most one even cycle. By a theorem of Alon, Tuza, and Voigt, the fractional list-chromatic number $\chi_\ell^\ast(G)$ of any graph $G$ equals its fractional chromatic number $\chi^\ast(G)$. This equality does not extend to fractional DP-colorings. Moreover, we show that the difference $\chi^\ast_{DP}(G) - \chi^\ast(G)$ can be arbitrarily large, and, furthermore, $\chi^\ast_{DP}(G) \geq d/(2 \ln d)$ for every graph $G$ of maximum average degree $d \geq 4$. On the other hand, we show that this asymptotic lower bound is tight for a large class of graphs that includes all bipartite graphs as well as many graphs of high girth and high chromatic number.;math.CO
1801.07308;Stochastic Proximal Gradient Algorithms for Multi-Source Quantitative Photoacoustic Tomography;The development of accurate and efficient image reconstruction algorithms is a central aspect of quantitative photoacoustic tomography (QPAT). In this paper, we address this issues for multi-source QPAT using the radiative transfer equation (RTE) as accurate model for light transport. The tissue parameters are jointly reconstructed from the acoustical data measured for each of the applied sources. We develop stochastic proximal gradient methods for multi-source QPAT, which are more efficient than standard proximal gradient methods in which a single iterative update has complexity proportional to the number applies sources. Additionally, we introduce a completely new formulation of QPAT as multilinear (MULL) inverse problem which avoids explicitly solving the RTE. The MULL formulation of QPAT is again addressed with stochastic proximal gradient methods. Numerical results for both approaches are presented. Besides the introduction of stochastic proximal gradient algorithms to QPAT, we consider the new MULL formulation of QPAT as main contribution of this paper.;math.NA
1801.07310;Propensity score methodology in the presence of network entanglement between treatments;In experimental design and causal inference, it may happen that the treatment is not defined on individual experimental units, but rather on pairs or, more generally, on groups of units. For example, teachers may choose pairs of students who do not know each other to teach a new curriculum, regulators might allow or disallow merging of firms, and biologists may introduce or inhibit interactions between genes or proteins. In this paper, we formalize this experimental setting, and we refer to the individual treatments in such setting as entangled treatments. We then consider the special case where individual treatments depend on a common population quantity, and develop theory and methodology to deal with this case. In our target applications, the common population quantity is a network, and the individual treatments are defined as functions of the change in the network between two specific time points. Our focus is on estimating the causal effect of entangled treatments in observational studies where entangled treatments are endogenous and cannot be directly manipulated. When treatment cannot be manipulated, be it entangled or not, it is necessary to account for the treatment assignment mechanism to avoid selection bias, commonly through a propensity score methodology. In this paper, we quantify the extent to which classical propensity score methodology ignores treatment entanglement, and characterize the bias in the estimated causal effects. To characterize such bias we introduce a novel similarity function between propensity score models, and a practical approximation of it, which we use to quantify model misspecification of propensity scores due to entanglement. One solution to avoid the bias in the presence of entangled treatments is to model the change in the network, directly, and calculate an individual unit's propensity score by averaging treatment assignments over this change.;math.ST
1801.07315;The branching curves and their application to the four dimensional Ricci flow;We study the four dimensional Ricci flow with the help of local invariants. If $(M^4, g(t))$ is a solution to the Ricci flow and $x \in M^4$, we can associate to the point $x$ a one-parameter family of curves, which lie in the product of two projective lines. This allows us to reformulate the Cheeger-Gromov-Hamilton Compactness Theorem in the context of these curves. We use this result, in order to study Type I singularities in dimension four and give a characterization of the corresponding singularity models.;math.DG
1801.07322;A remark on uniform boundedness for Brauer groups;The Tate conjecture for divisors on varieties over number fields is equivalent to finiteness of $\ell$-primary torsion in the Brauer group. We show that this finiteness is actually uniform in one-dimensional families for varieties that satisfy the Tate conjecture for divisors -- e.g. abelian varieties and $K3$ surfaces.;math.AG
1801.07325;Gaussian bounds for the weighted heat kernels on the interval, ball and simplex;The aim of this article is to establish two-sided Gaussian bounds for the heat kernels on the unit ball and simplex in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and in particular on the interval, generated by classical differential operators whose eigenfunctions are algebraic polynomials. To this end we develop a general method that employs the natural relation of such operators with weighted Laplace operators on suitable subsets of Riemannian manifolds and the existing general results on heat kernels. Our general scheme allows to consider heat kernels in the weighted cases on the interval, ball, and simplex with parameters in the full range.;math.CA
1801.07326;Gaussian bounds for the heat kernels on the ball and simplex: Classical approach;Two-sided Gaussian bounds are established for the weighted heat kernels on the unit ball and simplex in $\mathbb{R}^d$ generated by classical differential operators whose eigenfunctions are algebraic polynomials.;math.CA
1801.07329;On the Well-Posedness of Generalized Darcy Forchheimer Equation;Under necessary compatibility condition, and some mild regularity assumptions on the interior and the boundary data, we prove the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the solution of generalized Dary-Forchheimer model.;math.AP

1801.07334;On spherical codes with inner products in a prescribed interval;We develop a framework for obtaining linear programming bounds for spherical codes whose inner products belong to a prescribed subinterval $[\ell,s]$ of $[-1,1)$. An intricate relationship between Levenshtein-type upper bounds on cardinality of codes with inner products in $[\ell,s]$ and lower bounds on the potential energy (for absolutely monotone interactions) for codes with inner products in $[\ell,1)$ (when the cardinality of the code is kept fixed) is revealed and explained. Thereby, we obtain a new extension of Levenshtein bounds for such codes. The universality of our bounds is exhibited by a unified derivation and their validity for a wide range of codes and potential functions.;math.MG
1801.07342;Perfect simulation of the Hard Disks Model by Partial Rejection Sampling;We present a perfect simulation of the hard disks model via the partial rejection sampling method. Provided the density of disks is not too high, the method produces exact samples in $O(\log n)$ rounds, and total time $O(n)$, where $n$ is the expected number of disks. The method extends easily to the hard spheres model in $d&gt,2$ dimensions.;math.PR
1801.07347;Modeling and Performance Analysis of Full-Duplex Communications in Cache-Enabled D2D Networks;Cache-enabled Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is widely recognized as one of the key components of the emerging fifth generation (5G) cellular network architecture. However, conventional half-duplex (HD) transmission may not be sufficient to provide fast enough content delivery over D2D links in order to meet strict latency targets of emerging D2D applications. In-band full-duplex (FD), with its capability of allowing simultaneous transmission and reception, can improve spectral efficiency and reduce latency by providing more content delivery opportunities. In this paper, we consider a finite network of D2D nodes in which each node is endowed with FD capability. We first carefully list all possible operating modes for an arbitrary device using which we compute the number of devices that are actively transmitting at any given time. We then characterize network performance in terms of the success probability, which depends on the content availability, signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) distribution, as well as the operating mode of the D2D receiver. Our analysis concretely demonstrates that caching dictates the system performance in lower target SIR thresholds whereas interference dictates the performance at the higher target SIR thresholds.;cs.IT
1801.07356;Code-Frequency Block Group Coding for Anti-Spoofing Pilot Authentication in Multi-Antenna OFDM Systems;A pilot spoofer can paralyze the channel estimation in multi-user orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFD- M) systems by using the same publicly-known pilot tones as legitimate nodes. This causes the problem of pilot authentication (PA). To solve this, we propose, for a two-user multi-antenna OFDM system, a code-frequency block group (CFBG) coding based PA mechanism. Here multi-user pilot information, after being randomized independently to avoid being spoofed, are converted into activation patterns of subcarrier-block groups on code-frequency domain. Those patterns, though overlapped and interfered mutually in the wireless transmission environment, are qualified to be separated and identified as the original pilots with high accuracy, by exploiting CFBG coding theory and channel characteristic. Particularly, we develop the CFBG code through two steps, i.e., 1) devising an ordered signal detection technique to recognize the number of signals coexisting on each subcarrier block, and encoding each subcarrier block with the detected number, 2) constructing a zero-false-drop (ZFD) code and block detection based (BD) code via k-dimensional Latin hypercubes and integrating those two codes into the CFBG code. This code can bring a desirable pilot separation error probability (SEP), inversely proportional to the number of occupied subcarriers and antennas with a power of k. To apply the code to PA, a scheme of pilot conveying, separation and identification is proposed. Based on this novel PA, a joint channel estimation and identification mechanism is proposed to achieve high-precision channel recovery and simultaneously enhance PA without occupying extra resources. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.;cs.IT
1801.07363;On an Algorithm for Comparing the Chromatic Symmetric Functions of Trees;It is a long-standing question of Stanley whether or not the chromatic symmetric function (CSF) distinguishes unrooted trees. Previously, the best computational result, due to Russell, proved that it distinguishes all trees with at most $25$ vertices. In this paper, we present a novel probabilistic algorithm which may be used to check more efficiently that the CSF distinguishes a set of trees. Applying it, we verify that the CSF distinguishes all trees with up to $29$ vertices.;math.CO
1801.07371;On degenerate circular and shear flows: the point vortex and power law circular flows;We consider the problem of asymptotic stability and linear inviscid damping for perturbations of a point vortex and similar degenerate circular flows. Here, key challenges include the lack of strict monotonicity and the necessity of working in weighted Sobolev spaces whose weights degenerate as the radius tends to zero or infinity. Prototypical examples are given by circular flows with power law singularities or zeros as $r\downarrow 0$ or $r \uparrow \infty$.;math.AP
1801.07378;Weak compactness of sublevel sets in complete locally convex spaces;In this work we prove that if $X$ is a complete locally convex space and $f:X\to \mathbb{R}\cup \{+\infty \}$ is a function such that $f-x^\ast$ attains its minimum for every $x^\ast \in U$, where $U$ is an open set with respect to the Mackey topology in $X^\ast$, then for every $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}$ and $x^\ast \in U$ the set $\{ x\in X : f(x)- \langle x^\ast , x \rangle \leq \gamma \}$ is relatively weakly compact. This result corresponds to an extension of Theorem 2.4 in [J. Saint Raymond, Mediterr. J. Math. 10 (2013), no. 2, 927--940]. <br />Directional James compactness theorems are also derived.;math.FA
1801.07382;On Vorticity Gradient Growth for the Axisymmetric 3D Euler Equations Without Swirl;We consider the 3D axisymmetric Euler equations without swirl on some bounded axial symmetric domains. In this setting, well-posedness is well known due to the essentially 2D geometry. The quantity $\omega^\theta/r$ plays the role of vorticity in 2D. First, we prove that the gradient of $\omega^\theta/r$ can grow at most double exponentially with improving a priori bound close to the axis of symmetry. Next, on the unit ball, we show that at the boundary, one can achieve double exponential growth of the gradient of $\omega^\theta/r$.;math.AP
1801.07383;A class number formula for Picard modular surfaces;We investigate arithmetic aspects of the middle degree cohomology of compactified Picard modular surfaces $X$ attached to the unitary similitude group $\mathrm{GU}(2,1)$ for an imaginary quadratic extension $E/\mathbf{Q}$. We construct new Beilinson--Flach classes on $X$ and compute their Archimedean regulator. We obtain a special value formula involving a non-critical $L$-value of the degree six standard $L$-function, a Whittaker period, and the regulator. This provides evidence for Beilinson's conjecture in this setting.;math.NT
1801.07385;Exploring a Delta Schur Conjecture;In \cite{HRW15}, Haglund, Remmel, Wilson state a conjecture which predicts a purely combinatorial way of obtaining the symmetric function $\Delta_{e_k}e_n$. It is called the Delta Conjecture. It was recently proved in \cite{GHRY} that the Delta Conjecture is true when either $q=0$ or $t=0$. In this paper we complete a work initiated by Remmel whose initial aim was to explore the symmetric function $\Delta_{s_\nu} e_n$ by the same methods developed in \cite{GHRY}. Our first need here is a method for constructing a symmetric function that may be viewed as a "combinatorial side" for the symmetric function $\Delta_{s_\nu} e_n$ for $t=0$. Based on what was discovered in \cite{GHRY} we conjectured such a construction mechanism. We prove here that in the case that $\nu=(m-k,1^k)$ with $1\le m&lt, n$ the equality of the two sides can be established by the same methods used in \cite{GHRY}. While this work was in progress, we learned that Rhodes and Shimozono had previously constructed also such a "combinatorial side". Very recently, Jim Haglund was able to prove that their conjecture follows from the results in \cite{GHRY}. We show here that an appropriate modification of the Haglund arguments proves that the polynomial $\Delta_{s_\nu}e_n$ as well as the Rhoades-Shimozono "combinatorial side" have a plethystic evaluation with hook Schur function expansion.;math.CO
1801.07387;The sum of nonsingular matrices is often nonsingular;If $M$ is a set of nonsingular $k\times k$ matrices then for many pairs of matrices, $A,B\in M,$ the sum is nonsingular, $\det(A+B)\neq 0.$ We prove a more general statement on nonsingular sums with an application.;math.CO
1801.07389;Non-ergodic Complexity of Convex Proximal Inertial Gradient Descents;The proximal inertial gradient descent is efficient for the composite minimization and applicable for broad of machine learning problems. In this paper, we revisit the computational complexity of this algorithm and present other novel results, especially on the convergence rates of the objective function values. The non-ergodic O(1/k) rate is proved for proximal inertial gradient descent with constant stepzise when the objective function is coercive. When the objective function fails to promise coercivity, we prove the sublinear rate with diminishing inertial parameters. In the case that the objective function satisfies optimal strong convexity condition (which is much weaker than the strong convexity), the linear convergence is proved with much larger and general stepsize than previous literature. We also extend our results to the multi-block version and present the computational complexity. Both cyclic and stochastic index selection strategies are considered.;math.OC
1801.07390;Presheaves over a join restriction category;Just as the presheaf category is the free cocompletion of any small category, there is an analogous notion of free cocompletion for any small restriction category. In this paper, we extend the work on restriction presheaves to presheaves over join restriction categories, and show that the join restriction category of join restriction presheaves is equivalent to some partial map category of sheaves. We then use this to show that the Yoneda embedding exhibits the category of join restriction presheaves as the free cocompletion of any small join restriction category.;math.CT
1801.07393;Distributions: a spherical co-ordinates approach;When expressing a distribution in Euclidean space in spherical co-ordinates, derivation with respect to the radial and angular co-ordinates is far from trivial. Exploring the possibilities of defining a radial derivative of the delta-distribution (its angular derivatives being zero) led to the introduction of a new kind of distributions, the so-called signumdistributions, as continuous linear functionals on a space of test functions showing a singularity at the origin. In this paper we search for a definition of the radial and angular derivatives of a general standard distribution and again, as expected, we are inevitably led to consider signumdistributions. Although these signumdistributions provide an adequate framework for the actions on distributions aimed at, it turns out that the derivation with respect to the radial distance of a general (signum)distribution is still not yet unique, but gives rise to an equivalent class of (signum)distributions.;math.FA
1801.07398;Hom-Groups, Representations and Homological Algebra;A Hom-group G is a nonassociative version of a group where associativity, invertibility, and unitality are twisted by a map \alpha: G\longrightarrow G. Introducing the Hom-group algebra KG, we observe that Hom-groups are providing examples of Homalgebras, Hom-Lie algebras and Hom-Hopf algebras. We introduce two types of modules over a Hom-group G. To find out more about these modules, we introduce Hom-group (co)homology with coefficients in these modules. Our (co)homology theories generalizes group (co)homologies for groups. Despite the associative case we observe that the coefficients of Hom-group homology is different from the ones for Hom-group cohomology. We show that the inverse elements provide a relation between Hom-group (co)homology with coefficients in right and left G-modules. It will be shown that our (co)homology theories for Hom-groups with coefficients could be reduced to the Hochschild (co)homologies of Hom-group algebras. For certain coefficients the functoriality of Hom-group (co)homology will be shown.;math.GR
1801.07400;Super-Resolution mmWave Channel Estimation using Atomic Norm Minimization;We propose super-resolution MIMO channel estimators for millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems that employ hybrid analog and digital beamforming and generalized spatial modulation, respectively. Exploiting the inherent sparsity of mmWave channels, the channel estimation problem is formulated as an atomic norm minimization that enhances sparsity in the continuous angles of departure and arrival. Both pilot-assisted and data-aided channel estimators are developed, with the former one formulated as a convex problem and the latter as a non-convex problem. To solve these formulated channel estimation problems, we develop a computationally efficient conjugate gradient descent method based on non-convex factorization which restricts the search space to low-rank matrices. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the superior channel estimation performance of the proposed algorithms for both types of mmWave systems compared to the existing compressed-sensing-based estimators with finely quantized angle grids.;cs.IT
1801.07402;Statistical Studies of Fading in Underwater Wireless Optical Channels in the Presence of Air Bubble, Temperature, and Salinity Random Variations (Long Version);Optical signal propagation through underwater channels is affected by three main degrading phenomena, namely absorption, scattering, and fading. In this paper, we experimentally study the statistical distribution of intensity fluctuations in underwater wireless optical channels with random temperature and salinity variations as well as the presence of air bubbles. In particular, we define different scenarios to produce random fluctuations on the water refractive index across the propagation path, and then examine the accuracy of various statistical distributions in terms of their goodness of fit to the experimental data. We also obtain the channel coherence time to address the average period of fading temporal variations. The scenarios under consideration cover a wide range of scintillation index from weak to strong turbulence. Moreover, the effects of beam-collimator at the transmitter side and aperture averaging lens at the receiver side are experimentally investigated. We show that the use of a transmitter beam-collimator and/or a receiver aperture averaging lens suits single-lobe distributions such that the generalized Gamma and exponential Weibull distributions can excellently match the histograms of the acquired data. Our experimental results further reveal that the channel coherence time is on the order of $10^{-3}$ seconds and larger which implies to the slow fading turbulent channels.;cs.IT
1801.07404;Homotopy coherent structures;Naturally occurring diagrams in algebraic topology are commutative up to homotopy, but not on the nose. It was quickly realized that very little can be done with this information. Homotopy coherent category theory arose out of a desire to catalog the higher homotopical information required to restore constructibility (or more precisely, functoriality) in such "up to homotopy" settings. The first lecture will survey the classical theory of homotopy coherent diagrams of topological spaces. The second lecture will revisit the free resolutions used to define homotopy coherent diagrams and prove that they can also be understood as homotopy coherent realizations. This explains why diagrams valued in homotopy coherent nerves or more general $\infty$-categories are automatically homotopy coherent. The final lecture will venture into homotopy coherent algebra, connecting the newly discovered notion of homotopy coherent adjunction to the classical cobar and bar resolutions for homotopy coherent algebras.;math.CT
1801.07405;Divisorial condition for the stable gonality of tropical curves;Let d be a positive integer. There are several versions of d-gonality for tropical curves, stable d-gonality and divisorial d-gonality, which are both inspired by d-gonality for compact Riemann surfaces. However, that conditions are not equivalent. We have a condition of divisors equivalent to stable d-gonality for tropical curves.;math.AG
1801.07415;Sum Rules for Functions of the Riemann Zeta Type;We consider analytic functions of the Riemann zeta type, for which, if $s$ is a zero, so is $1-s$. We use infinite product representations of these functions, assuming their zeros to be of first order. We use exponential factors to accelerate convergence, and by comparing the exponential factors with the Taylor series coefficients about $s=0$ of the original function, connect these coefficients with sums of powers of reciprocals of the zeros, in the form of sum rules. Such sum rules have been previously considered by Lehmer and Keiper, but the approach and applications taken here are more general. In related work, a new sufficient condition is found for the Riemann hypothesis, and the basis for this condition is discussed.;math.NT
1801.07416;The degree of biholomorphisms of quasi-Reinhardt domains fixing the origin;We give a description of biholomorphisms of quasi-Reinhardt domains fixing the origin via Bergman representative coordinates, which are shown to be polynomial mappings with a degree bound given by the so-called "resonance order".;math.CV
1801.07419;Optimality of Simple Layered Superposition Coding in the 3 User MISO BC with Finite Precision CSIT;We study the $K=3$ user multiple input single output (MISO) broadcast channel (BC) with $M=3$ antennas at the transmitter and $1$ antenna at each receiver, from the generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) perspective, under the assumption that the channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) is limited to finite precision. In particular, our goal is to identify a parameter regime where a simple layered superposition (SLS) coding scheme achieves the entire GDoF region. With $\alpha_{ij}$ representing the channel strength parameter for the link from the $j^{th}$ antenna of the transmitter to the $i^{th}$ receiver, we prove that SLS is GDoF optimal without the need for time-sharing if $\max(\alpha_{ki},\alpha_{im})\leq\alpha_{ii}$ and $\alpha_{ki}+\alpha_{im}\le\alpha_{ii}+\alpha_{km}$ for all $i,k\in[3],m\in[M]$. The GDoF region under this condition is a convex polyhedron. The result generalizes to arbitrary $M\geq 3$.;cs.IT
1801.07420;Decay and vanishing of some axially symmetric D-solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations;We study axially symmetric D-solutions of the 3 dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. The first result is an a priori decay estimate of the velocity for general domains. The second is an a priori decay estimate of the vorticity in $\bR^3$, which improves the corresponding results in the literature. In addition, we prove a similar decay of full 3d solutions except for a small set of angles. <br />Next we turn to D-solutions which are periodic in the third variable and prove vanishing result under a reasonable condition. As a corollary we prove that axially symmetric D-solutions in the slab $\bR^2 \times I$ with suitable boundary condition is $0$. Here $I$ is any finite interval. To the best of our knowledge, this seems to be the first vanishing result on a 3 dimensional D-solution without extra integral or decay or smallness assumption on the solution. <br />The tools used include Brezis-Gallouet inequality, dimension reduction, scaling, Green's function bound and Liouville theorems for Navier-Stokes equations.;math.AP
1801.07422;A posteriori error estimation and adaptive strategy for PGD model reduction applied to parametrized linear parabolic problems;We define an a posteriori verification procedure that enables to control and certify PGD-based model reduction techniques applied to parametrized linear elliptic or parabolic problems. Using the concept of constitutive relation error, it provides guaranteed and fully computable global/goal-oriented error estimates taking both discretization and PGD truncation errors into account. Splitting the error sources, it also leads to a natural greedy adaptive strategy which can be driven in order to optimize the accuracy of PGD approximations. The focus of the paper is on two technical points: (i) construction of equilibrated fields required to compute guaranteed error bounds, (ii) error splitting and adaptive process when performing PGD-based model reduction. Performances of the proposed verification and adaptation tools are shown on several multi-parameter mechanical problems.;math.NA
1801.07423;Ultra-Reliable Short Message Cooperative Relaying Protocols under Nakagami-m Fading;In the next few years, the development of wireless communication systems propel the world into a fully connected society where the Machine-type Communications (MTC) plays a substantial role as key enabler in the future cellular systems. MTC is categorized into mMTC and uMTC, where mMTC provides the connectivity to massive number of devices while uMTC is related to low latency and ultra-high reliability of the wireless communications. This paper studies uMTC with incremental relaying technique, where the source and relay collaborate to transfer the message to a destination. In this paper, we compare the performance of two distinct cooperative relaying protocols with the direct transmission under the finite blocklength (FB) regime. We define the overall outage probability in each relaying scenario, supposing Nakagami-m fading. We show that cooperative communication outperforms direct transmission under the FB regime. In addition, we examine the impact of fading severity and power allocation factor on the outage probability and the minimum delay required to meet the ultra-reliable communication requirements. Moreover, we provide the outage probability in closed form.;cs.IT
1801.07428;On the sharp dimension estimate of CR holomorphic functions in Sasakian Manifolds;This is the very first paper to focus on the CR analogue of Yau's uniformization conjecture in a complete noncompact pseudohermitian $(2n+1)$-manifold of vanishing torsion (i.e. Sasakian manifold) which is an odd dimensional counterpart of K\"{a}hler geometry. In this paper, we mainly deal with the problem of the sharp dimension estimate of CR holomorphic functions in a complete noncompact pseudohermitian manifold of vanishing torsion with nonnegative pseudohermitian bisectional curvature.;math.DG
1801.07430;Leveraging Edge Caching in NOMA Systems with QoS Requirements;Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) and caching are two proposed approaches to increase the capacity of future 5G wireless systems. Typically in NOMA systems, signals at the receiver are decoded using successive interference cancellation in order to achieve capacity in multi-user systems. The leveraging of caching in the physical layer to further improve on the benefits of NOMA is investigated, which is termed cache-aided NOMA. Specific attention is given to the caching cases where the users with weaker channel conditions possess a cache of the information requested by a user with a stronger channel condition. The probability that any of the users is in outage for any of the rates required for this NOMA system, defined as the "union-outage," is derived for the case of fixed-power allocation, and the power allocation strategy that minimizes the union-outage probability is derived. Simulation results confirm the analytical results, which demonstrate the benefits of cache-aided NOMA on reducing the union-outages probability.;cs.IT

As a consequence, the P{\'o}lya conjecture for the Neumann eigenvalues holds for the second eigenvalue and for arbitrary domains. We moreover prove that a relaxed form of the same inequality holds in the context of non-smooth domains and densities.;math.AP
1801.07439;A non linear estimate on the life span of solutions of the three dimensional Navier-Stokes equations;The purpose of this article is to establish bounds from below for the life span of regular solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes system, whichinvolve norms not only of the initial data, but also of nonlinear functions of the initial data. We provide examples showing that those bounds are significant improvements to the one provided by the classical fixed point argument. One of the important ingredients is the use of a scale-invariant energy estimate.;math.AP
1801.07444;On Irregularities of Fourier Transforms of Regular Holonomic D-Modules;We study Fourier transforms of regular holonomic D-modules. By using the theory of Fourier-Sato transforms of enhanced ind-sheaves developed by Kashiwara-Schapira and D'Agnolo-Kashiwara, a formula for their enhanced solution complexes will be obtained. Moreover we show that some parts of their characteristic cycles and irregularities are expressed by the geometries of the original D-modules.;math.AG
1801.07452;A Proximal Approach for a Class of Matrix Optimization Problems;In recent years, there has been a growing interest in mathematical models leading to the minimization, in a symmetric matrix space, of a Bregman divergence coupled with a regularization term. We address problems of this type within a general framework where the regularization term is split in two parts, one being a spectral function while the other is arbitrary. A Douglas-Rachford approach is proposed to address such problems and a list of proximity operators is provided allowing us to consider various choices for the fit-to-data functional and for the regularization term. Numerical experiments show the validity of this approach for solving convex optimization problems encountered in the context of sparse covariance matrix estimation. Based on our theoretical results, an algorithm is also proposed for noisy graphical lasso where a precision matrix has to be estimated in the presence of noise. The nonconvexity of the resulting objective function is dealt with a majorization-minimization approach, i.e. by building a sequence of convex surrogates and solving the inner optimization subproblems via the aforementioned Douglas-Rachford procedure. We establish conditions for the convergence of this iterative scheme and we illustrate its good numerical performance with respect to state-of-the-art approaches.;math.OC
1801.07454;Center of mass distribution of the Jacobi unitary ensembles: Painleve V, asymptotic expansions;In this paper, we study the probability density function, $\mathbb{P}(c,\alpha,\beta, n)\,dc$, of the center of mass of the finite $n$ Jacobi unitary ensembles with parameters $\alpha\,&gt,-1$ and $\beta &gt,-1$, that is the probability that ${\rm tr}M_n\in(c, c+dc),$ where $M_n$ are $n\times n$ matrices drawn from the unitary Jacobi ensembles.

1801.07463;A cut finite element method with boundary value correction for the incompressible Stokes&#x27, equations;We design a cut finite element method for the incompressible Stokes equations on curved domains. The cut finite element method allows for the domain boundary to cut through the elements of the computational mesh in a very general fashion. To further facilitate the implementation we propose to use a piecewise affine discrete domain even if the physical domain has curved boundary. Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed using Nitsche's method on the discrete boundary and the effect of the curved physical boundary is accounted for using the boundary value correction technique introduced for cut finite element methods in Burman, Hansbo, Larson, 'A cut finite element method with boundary value correction', Math. Comp. 87(310):633--657, 2018.;math.NA
1801.07467;On defectivity of families of full-dimensional point configurations;The mixed discriminant of a family of point configurations can be considered as a generalization of the $A$-discriminant of one Laurent polynomial to a family of Laurent polynomials. Generalizing the concept of defectivity, a family of point configurations is called defective if the mixed discriminant is trivial. Using a recent criterion by Furukawa and Ito we give a necessary condition for defectivity of a family in the case that all point configurations are full-dimensional. This implies the conjecture by Cattani, Cueto, Dickenstein, Di Rocco and Sturmfels that a family of $n$ full-dimensional configurations in $\mathbb{Z}^n$ is defective if and only if the mixed volume of the convex hulls of its elements is $1$.;math.CO

In particular, for $1\le q &lt, p$ we deduce its compactness on all open sets $\Omega\subset \mathbb R^N$ on which it is continuous. We then relate, for all q up the fractional Sobolev conjugate exponent, the continuity of the embedding to the summability of the function solving the fractional torsion problem in $\Omega$ in a suitable weak sense, for every open set $\Omega$. The proofs make use of a non-local Hardy-type inequality in $\mathcal D^{s,p}_0(\Omega)$, involving the fractional torsion function as a weight.;math.AP
1801.07471;Counting conjugacy classes of fully irreducibles: double exponential growth;Inspired by results of Eskin and Mirzakhani counting closed geodesics of length $\le L$ in the moduli space of a fixed closed surface, we consider a similar question in the $Out(F_r)$ setting. The Eskin-Mirzakhani result can be equivalently stated in terms of counting the number of conjugacy classes (within the mapping class group) of pseudo-Anosovs whose dilitations have natural logarithm $\le L$. Let $\mathfrak N_r(L)$ denote the number of $Out(F_r)$-conjugacy classes of fully irreducibles satisfying that the natural logarithm of their dilatation is $\le L$. We prove for $r\ge 3$ that as $L\to\infty$, the number $\mathfrak N_r(L)$ has double exponential (in $L$) lower and upper bounds. These bounds reveal behavior not present in the surface setting or in classical hyperbolic dynamical systems.;math.GR
1801.07480;On Freudenthal theorem, Kahn-Priddy Theorem, and Curits conjecture;We verify Curtis conjecture on a class of elements of ${_2\pi_*^s}$ that satisfy a certain factorisation property. To be more precise, suppose $f\in{_2\pi_n^s}$ pulls back to $g\in{_2\pi_n^s}P$ through the Kahn-Priddy map $\lambda:QP\to Q_0S^0$ such that $g$ projects nontrivially to an element $g'\in{_2\pi_n^s}P_{t(n)}$ with $h(g')=0$ where $h:{_2\pi_*}QP_k\to H_*QP_k$ is the unstable Hurewicz map, and $t(n)=\lceil n/2\rceil$. Then, mod out by elements of ${_2\pi_*^s}\simeq{_2\pi_*}QS^0$ satisfying this property, the Curtis conjecture on the image of $h:{_2\pi_*}QS^0\to H_*QS^0$ holds.;math.AT
1801.07484;Protograph-based Quasi-Cyclic MDPC Codes for McEliece Cryptosystems;In this paper, ensembles of quasi-cyclic moderate-density parity-check (MDPC) codes based on protographs are introduced and analyzed in the context of a McEliece-like cryptosystem. The proposed ensembles significantly improve the error correction capability of the regular MDPC code ensembles that are currently considered for post-quantum cryptosystems without increasing the public key size. The proposed ensembles are analyzed in the asymptotic setting via density evolution, both under the sum-product algorithm and a low-complexity (error-and-erasure) message passing algorithm. The asymptotic analysis is complemented at finite block lengths by Monte Carlo simulations. The enhanced error correction capability remarkably improves the scheme robustness with respect to (known) decoding attacks.;cs.IT
1801.07487;Straggler Mitigation in Distributed Matrix Multiplication: Fundamental Limits and Optimal Coding;We consider the problem of massive matrix multiplication, which underlies many data analytic applications, in a large-scale distributed system comprising a group of worker nodes. We target the stragglers' delay performance bottleneck, which is due to the unpredictable latency in waiting for slowest nodes (or stragglers) to finish their tasks. We propose a novel coding strategy, named \emph{entangled polynomial code}, for designing the intermediate computations at the worker nodes in order to minimize the recovery threshold (i.e., the number of workers that we need to wait for in order to compute the final output). We demonstrate the optimality of entangled polynomial code in several cases, and show that it provides orderwise improvement over the conventional schemes for straggler mitigation. Furthermore, we characterize the optimal recovery threshold among all linear coding strategies within a factor of $2$ using \emph{bilinear complexity}, by developing an improved version of the entangled polynomial code. In particular, while evaluating bilinear complexity is a well-known challenging problem, we show that optimal recovery threshold for linear coding strategies can be approximated within a factor of $2$ of this fundamental quantity. On the other hand, the improved version of the entangled polynomial code enables further and orderwise reduction in the recovery threshold, compared to its basic version. Finally, we show that the techniques developed in this paper can also be extended to several other problems such as coded convolution and fault-tolerant computing, leading to tight characterizations.;cs.IT
1801.07504;Incidence bicomodules, M&#xf6,bius inversion, and a Rota formula for infinity adjunctions;In the same way decomposition spaces, also known as unital 2-Segal spaces, have incidence (co)algebras, and certain relative decomposition spaces have incidence (co)modules, we identify the structures that have incidence bi(co)modules: they are certain augmented double Segal spaces subject to some exactness conditions. We establish a M\"obius inversion principle for (co)modules, and a Rota formula for certain more involved structures called M\"obius bicomodule configurations. The most important instance of the latter notion arises as mapping cylinders of infinity adjunctions, or more generally of adjunctions between M\"obius decomposition spaces, in the spirit of Rota's original formula.;math.AT
1801.07510;On Fano and weak Fano Bott-Samelson-Demazure-Hansen varieties;Let $G$ be a simple algebraic group over the field of complex numbers. Fix a maximal torus $T$ and a Borel subgroup $B$ of $G$ containing $T$. Let $w$ be an element of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$, and let $Z(\tilde w)$ be the Bott-Samelson-Demazure-Hansen (BSDH) variety corresponding to a reduced expression $\tilde w$ of $w$ with respect to the data $(G, B, T)$. In this article we give complete characterization of the expressions $\tilde w$ such that the corresponding BSDH variety $Z(\tilde w)$ is Fano or weak Fano. As a consequence we prove vanishing theorems of the cohomology of tangent bundle of certain BSDH varieties and hence we get some local rigidity results.;math.AG
1801.07513;System-Level Modeling and Optimization of the Energy Efficiency in Cellular Networks -- A Stochastic Geometry Framework;In this paper, we analyze and optimize the energy efficiency of downlink cellular networks. With the aid of tools from stochastic geometry, we introduce a new closed-form analytical expression of the potential spectral efficiency (bit/sec/m$^2$). In the interference-limited regime for data transmission, unlike currently available mathematical frameworks, the proposed analytical formulation depends on the transmit power and deployment density of the base stations. This is obtained by generalizing the definition of coverage probability and by accounting for the sensitivity of the receiver not only during the decoding of information data, but during the cell association phase as well. Based on the new formulation of the potential spectral efficiency, the energy efficiency (bit/Joule) is given in a tractable closed-form formula. An optimization problem is formulated and is comprehensively studied. It is mathematically proved, in particular, that the energy efficiency is a unimodal and strictly pseudo-concave function in the transmit power, given the density of the base stations, and in the density of the base stations, given the transmit power. Under these assumptions, therefore, a unique transmit power and density of the base stations exist, which maximize the energy efficiency. Numerical results are illustrated in order to confirm the obtained findings and to prove the usefulness of the proposed framework for optimizing the network planning and deployment of cellular networks from the energy efficiency standpoint.;cs.IT
1801.07516;On the Smith normal form of a skew-symmetric D-optimal design of order $n\equiv 2\pmod{4}$;We show that the Smith normal form of a skew-symmetric D-optimal design of order $n\equiv 2\pmod{4}$ is determined by its order. Furthermore, we show that the Smith normal form of such a design can be written explicitly in terms of the order $n$, thereby proving a recent conjecture of Armario. We apply our result to show that certain D-optimal designs of order $n\equiv 2\pmod{4}$ are not equivalent to any skew-symmetric D-optimal design. We also provide a correction to a result in the literature on the Smith normal form of D-optimal designs.;math.CO
1801.07520;Multivariable Bergman shifts and Wold decompositions;Let $H_m(\mathbb B)$ be the analytic functional Hilbert space on the unit ball $\mathbb B \subset \mathbb C^n$ with reproducing kernel $K_m(z,w) = (1 - \langle z,w \rangle)^{-m}$. Using algebraic operator identities we characterize those commuting row contractions $T \in L(H)^n$ on a Hilbert space $H$ that decompose into the direct sum of a spherical coisometry and copies of the multiplication tuple $M_z \in L(H_m(\mathbb B))^n$. For $m=1$, this leads to a Wold decomposition for partially isometric commuting row contractions that are regular at $z = 0$. For $m = 1 = n$, the results reduce to the classical Wold decomposition of isometries. We thus extend corresponding one-variable results of Giselsson and Olofsson to the case of the unit ball.;math.FA
1801.07524;A note on symmetric linear forms and traces on the restricted quantum group $\bar U_q(\mathfrak{sl}(2))$;We prove two results about $\text{SLF}(\bar U_q)$, the algebra of symmetric linear forms on the restricted quantum group $\bar U_q = \bar U_q(\mathfrak{sl}(2))$. First, we express any trace on finite dimensional projective $\bar U_q$-modules as a linear combination in the basis of $\text{SLF}(\bar U_q)$ constructed by Gainutdinov - Tipunin and also by Arike. In particular, this allows us to determine the symmetric linear form corresponding to the modified trace on projective $\bar U_q$-modules. Second, we give the explicit multiplication rules between symmetric linear forms in this basis.;math.QA
1801.07525;On the quasi-arithmetic Gauss-type iteration;For a sequence of continuous, monotone functions $f_1,\dots,f_n \colon I \to \mathbb{R}$ ($I$ is an interval) we define the mapping $M \colon I^n \to I^n$ as a Cartesian product of quasi-arithmetic means generated by $f_j$-s. It is known that, for every initial vector, the iteration sequence of this mapping tends to the diagonal of $I^n$. <br />We will prove that whenever all $f_j$-s are $\mathcal{C}^2$ with nowhere vanishing first derivative, then this convergence is quadratic. Furthermore, the limit $\frac{\text{Var}\, M^{k+1}(v)}{(\text{Var}\, M^{k}(v))^2}$ will be calculated in a nondegenerated case.;math.CA
1801.07529;Connections between rank and dimension for subspaces of bilinear forms;Let $K$ be a field and let $V$ be a vector space of dimension $n$ over $K$. Let $M$ be a subspace of bilinear forms defined on $V\times V$. Let $r$ be the number of different non-zero ranks that occur among the elements of $M$. Our aim is to obtain an upper bound for $\dim M$ in terms of $r$ and $n$ under various hypotheses. As a sample of what we prove, we mention the following. Suppose that $m$ is the largest integer that occurs as the rank of an element of $M$. Then if $m\leq \lceil n/2\rceil$ and $|K|\geq m+1$, we have $\dim M\leq rn$. The case $r=1$ corresponds to a constant rank space and it is conjectured that $\dim M\leq n$ when $M$ is a constant rank $m$ space and $|K|\geq m+1$. We prove that the dimension bound for a constant rank $m$ space $M$ holds provided $|K|\geq m+1$ and either $K$ is finite or $K$ has characteristic different from 2 and $M$ consists of symmetric forms. In general, we show that if $M$ is a constant rank $m$ subspace and $|K|\geq m+1$, then $\dim M\leq \max\,(n,2m-1)$. We also provide more detailed results about constant rank subspaces over finite fields, especially subspaces of alternating or symmetric bilinear forms.;math.RA

1801.07547;Counting proper colourings in 4-regular graphs via the Potts model;We give tight upper and lower bounds on the internal energy per particle in the antiferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on $4$-regular graphs, for $q\ge 5$. This proves the first case of a conjecture of the author, Perkins, Jenssen, and Roberts on extensions of their methods, and implies tight bounds on the antiferromagnetic Potts partition function. <br />The zero-temperature limit gives upper and lower bounds on the number of proper $q$-colourings of $4$-regular graphs, which almost proves the case $d=4$ of a conjecture of Galvin and Tetali. For any $q \ge 5$ we prove that the number of proper $q$-colourings of a $4$-regular graph is maximised by a union of $K_{4,4}$'s.;math.CO
1801.07552;Explicit Green operators for quantum mechanical Hamiltonians.~II.~ Edge type singularities of the helium atom;We extend our approach of asymptotic parametrix construction for Hamiltonian operators from conical to edge-type singularities which is applicable to coalescence points of two particles of the helium atom and related two electron systems including the hydrogen molecule. Up to second order we have calculated the symbols of an asymptotic parametrix of the nonrelativisic Hamiltonian of the helium atom within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and provide explicit formulas for the corresponding Green operators which encode the asymptotic behaviour of the eigenfunctons near an edge.;math-ph

We prove that $(R_2/p)_{\mathbb{G}_2} \cong \mathbb{F}_p$. The result is new for $p=2$ and $p=3$. For primes $p\geq 5$, the result is a consequence of computations of Shimomura and Yabe and has been reproduced by Kohlhaase using different methods.;math.AT
1801.07560;Spectral Efficiency Optimization For Millimeter Wave Multi-User MIMO Systems;As a key enabling technology for 5G wireless, millimeter wave (mmWave) communication motivates the utilization of large-scale antenna arrays for achieving highly directional beamforming. However, the high cost and power consumption of RF chains stands in the way of adoption of the optimal fullydigital precoding in large-array systems. To reduce the number of RF chains while still maintaining the spatial multiplexing gain of large-array, hybrid precoding architecture has been proposed for mmWave systems and received considerable interest in both industry and academia. However, the optimal hybrid precoding design has not been fully understood, especially for the multi-user MIMO case. This paper is the first work that directly addresses the nonconvex hybrid precoding problem of mmWave multi-user MIMO systems (without any approximation) by using penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method. The proposed PDD method have a guaranteed convergence to KKT solutions of the hybrid precoding problem under a mild assumption. Simulation results show that, even when both the transmitter and the receivers are equipped with the fewest RF chains that are required to support multi-stream transmission, hybrid precoding can still approach the performance of fully-digital precoding in both the infinite resolution phase shifter case and the finite resolution phase shifter case with several bits quantization.;cs.IT
1801.07565;Evaluations of infinite series involving reciprocal hyperbolic functions;This paper presents a approach of summation of infinite series of hyperbolic functions. The approach is based on simple contour integral representions and residue computations with the help of some well known results of Eisenstein series given by Ramanujan and Berndt et al. Several series involving quadratic hyperbolic functions are evaluated, which can be expressed in terms of $z={}_2F_1(1/2,1/2,1,x)$ and $z'=dz/dx$. When a certain parameter in these series equal to $\pi$ the series are summable in terms of $\Gamma$ functions. Moreover, some interesting new consequences and illustrative examples are considered.;math.NT
1801.07570;On p-adic Frobenius lifts and p-adic periods, from a Deformation Theory viewpoint;Presenting p-adic numbers as {\em deformations} of finite fields allows a better understanding of Frobenius lifts and their connection with p-derivations in the sense of Buium \cite{Buium-Main}. In this way "numbers {\em are} functions", as recognized before \cite{Manin:Numbers}, allowing to view initial structure deformation problems as arithmetic differential equations as in \cite{Buium-Manin}, and providing a cohomological interpretation to Buium calculus via Hochschild cohomology which controls deformations of algebraic structures. <br />Applications to p-adic periods are considered, including to the classical Euler gamma and beta functions and their p-adic analogues, from a cohomological point of view. <br />Connections between various methods for computing scattering amplitudes are related to the moduli space problem and period domains.;math.NT
1801.07573;Singular analysis of RPA diagrams in coupled cluster theory;Coupled cluster theory provides hierarchical many-particle models and is presently considered as the ultimate benchmark in quantum chemistry. Despite is practical significance, a rigorous mathematical analysis of its properties is still in its infancy. The present work focuses on nonlinear models within the random phase approximation (RPA). Solutions of these models are commonly represented by series of a particular class of Goldstone diagrams so-called RPA diagrams. We present a detailed asymptotic analysis of these RPA diagrams using techniques from singular analysis and discuss their computational complexity within adaptive approximation schemes. In particular, we provide a connection between RPA diagrams and classical pseudo-differential operators which enables an efficient treatment of the linear and nonlinear interactions in these models. Finally, we discuss a best $N$-term approximation scheme for RPA-diagrams and provide the corresponding convergence rates.;math-ph
1801.07574;Transfer Principle for nth Order Fractional Brownian Motion with Applications to Prediction and Equivalence in Law;The $n$th order fractional Brownian motion was introduced by Perrin et al. It is the (upto a multiplicative constant) unique self-similar Gaussian process with Hurst index $H \in (n-1,n)$, having $n$th order stationary increments. We provide a transfer principle for the $n$th order fractional Brownian motion, i.e., we construct a Brownian motion from the $n$the order fractional Brownian motion and then represent the $n$the order fractional Brownian motion by using the Brownian motion in a non-anticipative way so that the filtrations of the $n$the order fractional Brownian motion and the associated Brownian motion coincide. By using this transfer principle, we provide the prediction formula for the $n$the order fractional Brownian motion and also a representation formula for all the Gaussian processes that are equivalent in law to the $n$th order fractional Brownian motion.;math.PR
1801.07576;On almost periodic solutions for a model of hematopoiesis with an oscillatory circulation loss rate;We establish and prove a fixed point theorem from which some sufficient conditions on the existence of positive almost periodic solutions for a model of hematopoiesis with oscillatory circulation loss rate are deduced. Some particular assumption under the nonlinearity of the equation has been previously considered by authors as fundamental for the study of almost periodic solutions of the model. The aim of this paper is to establish results without such assumption. Some examples are given to illustrate our results.;math.CA
1801.07584;The Case for Raabe&#x27,s Test;Among the techniques for determining the convergence of a series, Raabe's Test remains relatively unfamiliar to most mathematicians. We present several results relating to Raabe's Test that do not seem to be widely known, making the case that Raabe's Test should be featured more prominently in undergraduate calculus and analysis courses. In particular, we demonstrate that Raabe's Test may be viewed as an implicit comparison with a $p$-series, in the same manner that the Ratio Test and the Root Test constitute an implicit comparison with a geometric series. Moreover, Raabe's Test can sometimes simplify the process for determining conditional convergence.;math.HO
1801.07587;Towards Low-Latency and Ultra-Reliable Virtual Reality;Virtual Reality (VR) is expected to be one of the killer-applications in 5G networks. However, many technical bottlenecks and challenges need to be overcome to facilitate its wide adoption. In particular, VR requirements in terms of high-throughput, low-latency and reliable communication call for innovative solutions and fundamental research cutting across several disciplines. In view of this, this article discusses the challenges and enablers for ultra-reliable and low-latency VR. Furthermore, in an interactive VR gaming arcade case study, we show that a smart network design that leverages the use of mmWave communication, edge computing and proactive caching can achieve the future vision of VR over wireless.;cs.IT
1801.07588;Moment and tail estimation for U-statistics with positive kernels;We deduce the non-asymptotical (bilateral) estimates for moment inequalities for multiple sums of non-negative (more precisely, non-negative) independent random variables, on the other words, the well known U or V-statistics. Our consideration based on the correspondent estimates for the one-dimensional case by means of the so-called degenerate approximation. We apply also the theory of Bell functions as well as the properties of the Poisson distribution and the theory of the so-called Grand Lebesgue Spaces (GLS).;math.PR
1801.07589;Strong solutions to the Cauchy problem of the two-dimensional non-baratropic non-resistive magnetohydrodynamic equations with zero heat conduction;This paper concerns the Cauchy problem of the non-baratropic non-resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations with zero heat conduction on the whole two-dimensional (2D) space with vacuum as far field density. By delicate weighted energy estimates, we prove that there exists a local strong solution provided the initial density and the initial magnetic decay not too slow at infinity.;math.AP
1801.07590;Existence and homogenization of nonlinear elliptic systems in nonreflexive spaces;We consider a strongly nonlinear elliptic problem with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. The growth and the coercivity of the elliptic operator is assumed to be indicated by an inhomogeneous anisotropic $\mathcal{N}$-function. First, an existence result is shown under the assumption that the $\mathcal{N}$-function or its convex conjugate satisfies $\Delta_2$-condition. The second result concerns the homogenization process for families of strongly nonlinear elliptic problems with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition under above stated conditions on the elliptic operator, which is additionally assumed to be periodic in the spatial variable.;math.AP
1801.07597;Sharp comparison of moments and the log-concave moment problem;This article investigates sharp comparison of moments for various classes of random variables appearing in a geometric context. In the first part of our work we find the optimal constants in the Khintchine inequality for random vectors uniformly distributed on the unit ball of the space $\ell_q^n$ for $q\in(2,\infty)$, complementing past works that treated $q\in(0,2]\cup\{\infty\}$. As a byproduct of this result, we prove an extremal property for weighted sums of symmetric uniform distributions among all symmetric unimodal distributions. In the second part we provide a one-to-one correspondence between vectors of moments of symmetric log-concave functions and two simple classes of piecewise log-affine functions. These functions are shown to be the unique extremisers of the $p$-th moment functional, under the constraint of a finite number of other moments being fixed, which is a refinement of the description of extremisers provided by the generalised localisation theorem of Fradelizi and Gu\'edon [Adv. Math. 204 (2006) no. 2, 509-529].;math.FA
1801.07598;Weighted local Weyl laws for elliptic operators;Let $A$ be an elliptic pseudo-differential operator of order $m$ on a closed manifold $\mathcal{X}$ of dimension $n&gt,0$, formally positive self-adjoint with respect to some positive smooth density $d\mu_\mathcal{X}$. Then, the spectrum of $A$ is made up of a sequence of eigenvalues $(\lambda_k)_{k\geq 1}$ whose corresponding eigenfunctions $(e_k)_{k\geq 1}$ are $C^\infty$ smooth. Fix $s\in\mathbb{R}$ and define \[ K_L^s(x,y)=\sum_{0&lt,\lambda_k\leq L}\lambda_k^{-s} e_k(x)\overline{e_k(y)}\, .\] We derive asymptotic formulae near the diagonal for the kernels $K_L^s(x,y)$ when $L\rightarrow +\infty$ with fixed $s$. For $s=0$, $K^0_L$ is the kernel of the spectral projector studied by H\"ormander in \cite{ho68}. In the present work we build on H\"ormander's result to study the kernels $K^s_L$. If $s&lt,\frac{n}{m}$, $K_L^s$ is of order $L^{-s+n/m}$ and near the diagonal, the rescaled leading term behaves like the Fourier transform of an explicit function of the symbol of $A$. If $s=\frac{n}{m}$, under some explicit generic condition on the principal symbol of $A$, which holds if $A$ is a differential operator, the kernel has order $\ln(L)$ and the leading term has a logarithmic divergence smoothed at scale $L^{-1/m}$. Our results also hold for elliptic differential Dirichlet eigenvalue problems.;math.SP
1801.07600;Conditioned point processes with application to L&#xe9,vy bridges;Our first result concerns a characterisation by means of a functional equation of Poisson point processes conditioned by the value of their first moment. It leads to a generalised version of Mecke's formula. En passant, it also allows to gain quantitative results about stochastic domination for Poisson point processes under linear constraints. Since bridges of a pure jump L\'evy process in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with a height $a$ can be interpreted as a Poisson point process on space-time conditioned by pinning its first moment to $a$, our approach allows us to characterize bridges of L\'evy processes by means of a functional equation. The latter result has two direct applications: first we obtain a constructive and simple way to sample L\'evy bridge dynamics, second it allows to estimate the number of jumps for such bridges. We finally show that our method remains valid for linearly perturbed L\'evy processes like periodic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes driven by L\'evy noise.;math.PR
1801.07601;Justification of the NLS approximation for ion Euler-Poisson equation;The nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation can be derived as a formal approximation equation describing the envelopes of slowly modulated spatially and temporarily oscillating wave packet-like solutions to the ion Euler-Poisson equation. In this paper, we rigorously justify such approximation by giving error estimates in Sobolev norms between exact solutions of the ion Euler-Poisson system and the formal approximation obtained via the NLS equation. The justification consists of several difficulties such as the resonances and loss of regularity, due to the quasilinearity of the problem. These difficulties are overcome by introducing normal form transformation and cutoff functions and carefully constructed energy functional of the equation.;math.AP
1801.07602;Biquandle (co)homology and handlebody-links;In this paper, we introduce the (co)homology group of a multiple conjugation biquandle. It is the (co)homology group of the prismatic chain complex, which is related to the homology of foams introduced by J. S. Carter, modulo a certain subchain complex. We construct invariants for $S^1$-oriented handlebody-links using $2$-cocycles. When a multiple conjugation biquandle $X\times\mathbb{Z}_{\operatorname{type}X_Y}$ is obtained from a biquandle $X$ using $n$-parallel operations, we provide a $2$-cocycle (or $3$-cocycle) of the multiple conjugation biquandle $X\times\mathbb{Z}_{\operatorname{type}X_Y}$ from a $2$-cocycle (or $3$-cocycle) of the biquandle $X$ equipped with an $X$-set $Y$.;math.GT
1801.07608;Diffraction of return time measures;Letting $T$ denote an ergodic transformation of the unit interval and letting $f \colon [0,1)\to \mathbb{R}$ denote an observable, we construct the $f$-weighted return time measure $\mu_y$ for a reference point $y\in[0,1)$ as the weighted Dirac comb with support in $\mathbb{Z}$ and weights $f \circ T^z(y)$ at $z\in\mathbb{Z}$, and if $T$ is non-invertible, then we set the weights equal to zero for all $z &lt, 0$. Given such a Dirac comb, we are interested in its diffraction spectrum which emerges from the Fourier transform of its autocorrelation and analyse it for the dependence on the underlying transformation. For certain rapidly mixing transformations and observables of bounded variation, we show that the diffraction of $\mu_{y}$ consists of a trivial atom and an absolutely continuous part, almost surely with respect to $y$. This contrasts what occurs in the setting of regular model sets arising from cut and project schemes and deterministic incommensurate structures. As a prominent example of non-mixing transformations, we consider the family of rigid rotations $T_{\alpha} \colon x \to x + \alpha \bmod{1}$ with rotation number $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}^+$. In contrast to when $T$ is mixing, we observe that the diffraction of $\mu_{y}$ is pure point, almost surely with respect to $y$. Moreover, if $\alpha$ is irrational and the observable $f$ is Riemann integrable, then the diffraction of $\mu_{y}$ is independent of $y$. Finally, for a converging sequence $(\alpha_{i})_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ of rotation numbers, we provide new results concerning the limiting behaviour of the associated diffractions.;math.DS
1801.07609;Hyperbolic geometry for non-differential topologists;A soft presentation of hyperbolic spaces, free of differential apparatus, is offered. Fifth Euclid's postulate in such spaces is overthrown and, among other things, it is proved that spheres (equipped with great-circle distances) and hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces are the only locally compact geodesic (i.e., convex) metric spaces that are three-point homogeneous.;math.MG

For $r \asymp d \asymp T$ the subconvexity bound $L(1/2, f) \ll T^{3/4 - 1/140000}$ is proved.;math.NT
1801.07612;Optimization-based Motion Planning in Virtual Driving Scenarios with Application to Communicating Autonomous Vehicles;The paper addresses the problem of providing suitable reference trajectories in motion planning problems for autonomous vehicles. Among the various approaches to compute a reference trajectory, our aim is to find those trajectories which optimize a given performance criterion, for instance fuel consumption, comfort, safety, time, and obey constraints, e.g. collision avoidance, safety regions, control bounds. This task can be approached by geometric shortest path problems or by optimal control problems, which need to be solved efficiently. To this end we use direct discretization schemes and model-predictive control in combination with sensitivity updates to predict optimal solutions in the presence of perturbations. Applications arising in autonomous driving are presented. In particular, a distributed control algorithm for traffic scenarios with several autonomous vehicles that use car-to-car communication is introduced.;math.OC
1801.07614;Edge Computing Meets Millimeter-wave Enabled VR: Paving the Way to Cutting the Cord;In this paper, a novel proactive computing and mmWave communication for ultra-reliable and low latency wireless virtual reality (VR is proposed. By leveraging information about users' poses, proactive computing and caching are used to pre-compute and store users' HD video frames to minimize the computing latency. Furthermore, multi-connectivity is exploited to ensure reliable mmWave links to deliver users' requested HD frames. The performance of the proposed approach is validated on a VR network serving an interactive gaming arcade, where dynamic and real-time rendering of HD video frames is needed and impulse actions of different players impact the content to be shown. Simulation results show significant gains of up to $30\%$ reduction in end-to-end delay and $50\%$ in the $90^{\textrm{th}}$ percentile communication delay.;cs.IT
1801.07616;Computing polynomial conformal models for low-degree Blaschke products;For any finite Blaschke product $B$, there is an injective analytic map $\varphi:\mathbb{D}\to\mathbb{C}$ and a polynomial $p$ of the same degree as $B$ such that $B=p\circ\varphi$ on $\mathbb{D}$. Several proofs of this result have been given over the past several years, using fundamentally different methods. However, even for low-degree Blaschke products, no method has hitherto been developed to explicitly compute the polynomial $p$ or the associated conformal map $\varphi$. In this paper, we show how these functions may be computed for a Blaschke product of degree at most three, as well as for Blaschke products of arbitrary degree whose zeros are equally spaced on a circle centered at the origin.;math.CV
1801.07619;Some generalized numerical radius inequalities involving Kwong functions;We prove several numerical radius inequalities involving positive semidefinite matrices via the Hadamard product and Kwong functions. Among other inequalities, it is shown that if $X$ is an arbitrary $n\times n$ matrix and $A,B$ are positive semidefinite, then \begin{align*} \omega(H_{f,g}(A))\leq k\, \omega(AX+XA), \end{align*} which is equivalent to \begin{align*} \omega\big(H_{f,g}(A,B)\pm H_{f,g}(B,A)\big)\leq k'\,\left\{\omega((A+B)X+X(A+B))+\omega((A-B)X-X(A-B))\right\}, \end{align*} where $f$ and $g$ are two continuous functions on $(0,\infty)$ such that $h(t)={f(t)\over g(t)}$ is Kwong, $k=\max\left\{{f(\lambda)g(\lambda)\over \lambda}: {\lambda\in\sigma(A)}\right\}$ and $k'=\max\left\{{f(\lambda)g(\lambda)\over \lambda}: {\lambda\in\sigma(A)\cup\sigma(B)}\right\}$.;math.FA
1801.07627;Algorithms for difference families in finite abelian groups;Our main objective is to show that the computational methods that we previously developed to search for difference families in cyclic groups can be fully extended to the more general case of arbitrary finite abelian groups. In particular the power density PSD-test and the method of compression can be used to help the search.;math.CO
1801.07634;Khovanov homology detects the trefoils;We prove that Khovanov homology detects the trefoils. Our proof incorporates an array of ideas in Floer homology and contact geometry. It uses open books, the contact invariants we defined in the instanton Floer setting, a bypass exact triangle in sutured instanton homology, proven here, and Kronheimer and Mrowka's spectral sequence relating Khovanov homology with singular instanton knot homology. As a byproduct, we also strengthen a result of Kronheimer and Mrowka on $SU(2)$ representations of the knot group.;math.GT
1801.07636;On Calabi&#x27,s extremal metric and properness;In this paper we extend recent breakthrough of Chen-Cheng \cite{CC1, CC2, CC3} on existence of constant scalar K\"ahler metric on a compact K\"ahler manifold to Calabi's extremal metric. Our argument follows \cite{CC3} and there are no new a prior estimates needed, but rather there are necessary modifications adapted to the extremal case. We prove that there exists an extremal metric with extremal vector $V$ if and only if the modified Mabuchi energy is proper, modulo the action the subgroup in the identity component of automorphism group which commutes with the flow of $V$. We introduce two essentially equivalent notions, called \emph{reductive properness} and \emph{reduced properness}. We observe that one can test reductive properness/reduced properness only for invariant metrics. We prove that existence of an extremal metric is equivalent to reductive properness/reduced properness of the modified Mabuchi energy.;math.DG
1801.07638;On the Hamilton-Waterloo Problem with cycle lengths of distinct parities;Let $K_v^*$ denote the complete graph $K_v$ if $v$ is odd and $K_v-I$, the complete graph with the edges of a 1-factor removed, if $v$ is even. Given non-negative integers $v, M, N, \alpha, \beta$, the Hamilton-Waterloo problem asks for a $2$-factorization of $K^*_v$ into $\alpha$ $C_M$-factors and $\beta$ $C_N$-factors. Clearly, $M,N\geq 3$, $M\mid v$, $N\mid v$ and $\alpha+\beta = \lfloor\frac{v-1}{2}\rfloor$ are necessary conditions. <br />Very little is known on the case where $M$ and $N$ have different parities. In this paper, we make some progress on this case by showing, among other things, that the above necessary conditions are sufficient whenever $M|N$, $v&gt,6N&gt,36M$, and $\beta\geq 3$.;math.CO
1801.07640;Model theory and combinatorics of banned sequences;We set up a general context in which one can prove Sauer-Shelah type lemmas. We apply our general results to answer a question of Bhaskar and give a slight improvement to a result of Malliaris and Terry. We also prove a new Sauer-Shelah type lemma in the context of op-rank, a notion of Guingona and Hill.;math.LO
1801.07642;Quantum statistical manifolds: the linear growth case;A class of vector states on a von Neumann algebra is constructed. These states belong to a deformed exponential family. One specific deformation is considered. It makes the exponential function asymptotically linear. Difficulties arising due to non-commutativity are highlighted.;math.FA
1801.07645;Runge tubes in Stein manifolds with the density property;In this paper we give a very simple proof of the existence and plenitude of Runge tubes in $\mathbb C^n$ $(n&gt,1)$ and, more generally, in Stein manifolds with the density property. We show in particular that for any algebraic submanifold $A$ of codimension at least two in a complex Euclidean space $\mathbb C^n$, the normal bundle of $A$ in $\mathbb C^n$ admits a holomorphic embedding onto a Runge domain in $\mathbb C^n$ which agrees with the inclusion map $A\hookrightarrow \mathbb C^n$ on the zero section.;math.CV
1801.07658;When Kloosterman sums meet Hecke eigenvalues;By elaborating a two-dimensional Selberg sieve with asymptotics and equidistributions of Kloosterman sums from $\ell$-adic cohomology, as well as a Bombieri--Vinogradov type mean value theorem for Kloosterman sums in arithmetic progressions, it is proved that for any given primitive Hecke--Maass cusp form of trivial nebentypus, the eigenvalue of the $n$-th Hecke operator does not coincide with the Kloosterman sum $\mathrm{Kl}(1,n)$ for infinitely many squarefree $n$ with at most $100$ prime factors. This provides a partial negative answer to a problem of Katz on modular structures of Kloosterman sums.;math.NT
1801.07665;On all Pickands Dependence Functions whose corresponding Extreme-Value-Copulas have Spearman $&#x3c1,$ (Kendall $&#x3c4,$) identical to some value $v \in [0,1]$;We answer an open question posed by the second author at the Salzburg workshop on Dependence Models and Copulas in 2016 concerning the size of the family $\mathcal{A}^\rho_v$ ($\mathcal{A}^\tau_v$) of all Pickands dependence functions $A$ whose corresponding Extreme-Value-Copulas have Spearman $\rho$ (Kendall $\tau$) equal to some arbitrary, fixed value $v \in [0,1]$. After determining compact sets $\Omega^\rho_v, \Omega^\tau_v \subseteq [0,1] \times [\frac{1}{2},1]$ containing the graphs of all Pickands dependence functions from the classes $\mathcal{A}^\rho_v$ and $\mathcal{A}^\tau_v$ respectively, we then show that both sets are best possible.;math.ST
1801.07667;Puzzles in $K$-homology of Grassmannians;Knutson, Tao, and Woodward formulated a Littlewood-Richardson rule for the cohomology ring of Grassmannians in terms of puzzles. Vakil and Wheeler-Zinn-Justin have found additional triangular puzzle pieces that allow one to express structure constants for $K$-theory of Grassmannians. Here we introduce two other puzzle pieces of hexagonal shape, each of which gives a Littlewood-Richardson rule for $K$-homology of Grassmannians. We also explore the corresponding eight versions of $K$-theoretic Littlewood-Richardson tableaux.;math.CO
1801.07669;Ergodic control of a class of jump diffusions with finite L&#xe9,vy measures and rough kernels;We study the ergodic control problem for a class of jump diffusions in $\mathbb{R}^d$, which are controlled through the drift with bounded controls. The Levy measure is finite, but has no particular structure, it can be anisotropic and singular. Moreover, there is no blanket ergodicity assumption for the controlled process. Unstable behavior is `discouraged' by the running cost which satisfies a mild coercive hypothesis (i.e., is near-monotone). We first study the problem in its weak formulation as an optimization problem on the space of infinitesimal ergodic occupation measures, and derive the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation under minimal assumptions on the parameters, including verification of optimality results, using only analytical arguments. We also examine the regularity of invariant measures. Then, we address the jump diffusion model, and obtain a complete characterization of optimality.;math.OC
1801.07672;Monomial ideals with tiny squares;Let $I \subset K[x,y]$ be a monomial ideal. How small can $\mu(I^2)$ be in terms of $\mu(I)$? It has been expected that the inequality $\mu(I^2) &gt, \mu(I)$ should hold whenever $\mu(I) \ge 2$. Here we disprove this expectation and provide a somewhat surprising answer to the above question.;math.AC
1801.07675;Coupled Fixed Points of monotone mappings in a metric space with a graph;In this work, we define the concept of mixed $G$-monotone mappings defined on a metric space endowed with a graph. Then we obtain sufficient conditions for the existence of coupled fixed points for such mappings when a weak contractivity type condition is satisfied.;math.FA
1801.07678;A simple proof of the Wirsching-Goodwin representation of integers connected to 1 in the $3x+1$ problem;This paper gives a simple proof of the Wirsching-Goodwin representation of integers connected to 1 in the $3x+1$ problem (see \cite{Wirsching} and \cite{Goodwin}). This representation permits to compute all the ascending Collatz sequences $(f^{(i)}(n),\: i=1,b-1)$ with a last value $f^{(b)}(n)=1.$ Other periodic sequences connected to $1$ are also identified.;math.NT
1801.07684;A combinatorial model for computing volumes of flow polytopes;We introduce new families of combinatorial objects whose enumeration computes volumes of flow polytopes. These objects provide an interpretation, based on parking functions, of Baldoni and Vergne's generalization of a volume formula originally due to Lidskii. We recover known flow polytope volume formulas and prove new volume formulas for flow polytopes that were seemingly unapproachable. A highlight of our model is an elegant formula for the flow polytope of a graph we call the caracol graph. <br />As by-products of our work, we uncover a new triangle of numbers that interpolates between Catalan numbers and the number of parking functions, we prove the log-concavity of rows of this triangle along with other sequences derived from volume computations, and we introduce a new Ehrhart-like polynomial for flow polytope volume and conjecture product formulas for the polytopes we consider.;math.CO
1801.07690;A note on the fibres of Mori fibre spaces;In this note we consider the problem of determining which Fano manifolds can be realised as fibres of a Mori fibre space. In particular, we study the case of toric varieties, Fano manifolds with high index and some Fano manifolds with high Picard rank.;math.AG
1801.07695;Homologous Codes for Multiple Access Channels;Building on recent development by Padakandla and Pradhan, and by Lim, Feng, Pastore, Nazer, and Gastpar, this paper studies the potential of structured nested coset coding as a complete replacement for random coding in network information theory. The roles of two techniques used in nested coset coding to generate nonuniform codewords, namely, shaping and channel transformation, are clarified and illustrated via the simple example of the two-sender multiple access channel. While individually deficient, the optimal combination of shaping and channel transformation is shown to achieve the same performance as traditional random codes for the general two-sender multiple access channel. The achievability proof of the capacity region is extended to the multiple access channels with more than two senders, and with one or more receivers. A quantization argument consistent with the construction of nested coset codes is presented to prove achievability for their Gaussian counterparts. These results open up new possibilities of utilizing nested coset codes with the same generator matrix for a broader class of applications.;cs.IT
1801.07699;On the Uniqueness of Global Multiple SLEs;This article focuses on the characterization of global multiple Schramm-Loewner evolutions (SLE). The chordal SLE process describes the scaling limit of a single interface in various critical lattice models with Dobrushin boundary conditions, and similarly, global multiple SLEs describe scaling limits of collections of interfaces in critical lattice models with alternating boundary conditions. In this article, we give a minimal amount of characterizing properties for the global multiple SLEs: we prove that there exists a unique probability measure on collections of pairwise disjoint continuous simple curves with a certain conditional law property. As a consequence, we obtain the convergence of multiple interfaces in the critical Ising and FK-Ising models.;math.PR
1801.07701;General and Refined Montgomery Lemmata;Montgomery's Lemma on the torus $\mathbb{T}^d$ states that a sum of $N$ Dirac masses cannot be orthogonal to many low-frequency trigonometric functions in a quantified way. We provide an extension to general manifolds that also allows for positive weights: let $(M,g)$ be a smooth compact $d-$dimensional manifold without boundary, let $(\phi_k)_{k=0}^{\infty}$ denote the Laplacian eigenfunctions, let $\left\{ x_1, \dots, x_N\right\} \subset M$ be a set of points and $\left\{a_1, \dots, a_N\right\} \subset \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ be a sequence of nonnegative weights. Then $$\sum_{k=0}^{X}{ \left| \sum_{n=1}^{N}{ a_n \phi_k(x_n)} \right|^2} \gtrsim_{(M,g)} \left(\sum_{i=1}^{N}{a_i^2} \right) \frac{ X}{(\log{X})^{\frac{d}{2}}}.$$ This result is sharp up to the logarithmic factor. Furthermore, we prove a refined spherical version of Montgomery's Lemma, and provide applications to estimates of discrepancy and discrete energies of $N$ points on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{d}$.;math.CA
1801.07703;A McKean--Vlasov equation with positive feedback and blow-ups;We study a McKean--Vlasov equation arising from a mean-field model of a particle system with positive feedback. As particles hit a barrier they cause the other particles to jump in the direction of the barrier and this feedback mechanism leads to the possibility that the system can exhibit contagious blow-ups. Using a fixed-point argument we construct a differentiable solution up to a first explosion time. Our main contribution is a proof of uniqueness in the class of c\`{a}dl\`{a}g functions, which confirms the validity of related propagation-of-chaos results in the literature. We extend the allowed initial conditions to include densities with any power law decay at the boundary, and connect the exponent of decay with the growth exponent of the solution in small time in a precise way. This takes us asymptotically close to the control on initial conditions required for a global solution theory. A novel minimality result and trapping technique are introduced to prove uniqueness.;math.PR
1801.07730;Derived Hom spaces in rigid analytic geometry;We construct a derived enhancement of Hom spaces between rigid analytic spaces. It encodes the hidden deformation-theoretic informations of the underlying classical moduli space. The main tool in our construction is the representability theorem in derived analytic geometry, which has been established in our previous work. The representability theorem provides us sufficient and necessary conditions for an analytic moduli functor to possess the structure of a derived analytic stack. In order to verify the conditions of the representability theorem, we prove several general results in the context of derived non-archimedean analytic geometry: derived Tate acyclicity, projection formula, and proper base change. These results also deserve independent interest themselves. Our main motivation comes from non-archimedean enumerative geometry. In our subsequent works, we will apply the derived mapping stacks to obtain non-archimedean analytic Gromov-Witten invariants.;math.AG
1801.07733;On the Key Generation Rate of Physically Unclonable Functions;In this paper, an algebraic binning based coding scheme and its associated achievable rate for key generation using physically unclonable functions (PUFs) is determined. This achievable rate is shown to be optimal under the generated-secret (GS) model for PUFs. Furthermore, a polar code based polynomial-time encoding and decoding scheme that achieves this rate is also presented.;cs.IT
1801.07734;From Centralized to Decentralized Coded Caching;We consider the problem of designing decentralized schemes for coded caching. In this problem there are $K$ users each caching $M$ files out of a library of $N$ total files. The question is to minimize $R$, the number of broadcast transmissions to satisfy all the user demands. Decentralized schemes allow the creation of each cache independently, allowing users to join or leave without dependencies. Previous work showed that to achieve a coding gain $g$, i.e. $R \leq K (1-M/N)/g$ transmissions, each file has to be divided into number of subpackets that is exponential in $g$. <br />In this work we propose a simple translation scheme that converts any constant rate centralized scheme into a random decentralized placement scheme that guarantees a target coding gain of $g$. If the file size in the original constant rate centralized scheme is subexponential in $K$, then the file size for the resulting scheme is subexponential in $g$. When new users join, the rest of the system remains the same. However, we require an additional communication overhead of $O(\log K)$ bits to determine the new user's cache state. We also show that the worst-case rate guarantee degrades only by a constant factor due to the dynamics of user arrival and departure.;cs.IT
1801.07739;Reduced invariants from cuspidal maps;We consider genus 1 enumerative invariants arising from the Smyth-Viscardi moduli space of stable maps from curves with nodes and cusps. We prove that these invariants are equal to the Vakil-Zinger reduced invariants for the quintic threefold, providing a modular interpretation of the latter.;math.AG
1801.07745;Optimal Transport on Discrete Domains;Inspired by the matching of supply to demand in logistical problems, the optimal transport (or Monge--Kantorovich) problem involves the matching of probability distributions defined over a geometric domain such as a surface or manifold. In its most obvious discretization, optimal transport becomes a large-scale linear program, which typically is infeasible to solve efficiently on triangle meshes, graphs, point clouds, and other domains encountered in graphics and machine learning. Recent breakthroughs in numerical optimal transport, however, enable scalability to orders-of-magnitude larger problems, solvable in a fraction of a second. Here, we discuss advances in numerical optimal transport that leverage understanding of both discrete and smooth aspects of the problem. State-of-the-art techniques in discrete optimal transport combine insight from partial differential equations (PDE) with convex analysis to reformulate, discretize, and optimize transportation problems. The end result is a set of theoretically-justified models suitable for domains with thousands or millions of vertices. Since numerical optimal transport is a relatively new discipline, special emphasis is placed on identifying and explaining open problems in need of mathematical insight and additional research.;math.OC
1801.07751;Torsion and Linking number for a surface diffeomorphism;For a $\mathcal{C}^1$ diffeomorphism $f:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^2$ isotopic to the identity, we prove that for any value $l\in\mathbb{R}$ of the linking number at finite time of the orbits of two points there exists at least a point whose torsion at the same finite time equals $l\in\mathbb{R}$. As an outcome, we give a much simpler proof of a theorem by Matsumoto and Nakayama concerning torsion of measure on $\mathbb{T}^2$. In addition, in the framework of twist maps, we generalize a known result concerning the linking number of periodic points: indeed, we estimate such value for any couple of points for which the limit of the linking number exists.;math.DS
1801.07754;Reduction of certain crystalline representations and local constancy in the weight space;We study the mod $p$ reduction of crystalline local Galois representations of dimension 2 under certain conditions on its weight and slope. Berger showed that for a fixed non-zero trace of the Frobenius, the reduction process is locally constant for varying weights. By explicit computation we obtain an upper bound that is a linear function of the slope, for the radius of this local constancy around some special points in the weight space.;math.NT
1801.07758;Analysis on the Projective Octagasket;The existence of a self similar Laplacian on the Projective Octagasket, a non-finitely ramified fractal is only conjectured. We present experimental results using a cell approximation technique originally given by Kusuoka and Zhou. A rigorous recursive algorithm for the discrete Laplacian is given. Further, the spectrum and eigenfunctions of the Laplacian together with its symmetries are categorized and utilized in the construction of solutions to the heat equation.;math.SP
1801.07760;Cominimaxness with respect to ideals of dimension one;Let $R$ be a commutative Noetherian ring, $\fa$ be an ideal of $R$ and $M$ be an $R$-module. It is shown that if $\Ext^i_R(R/\fa,M)$ is minimax for all $i\leq \dim M$, then the $R$-module $\Ext^i_R(N,M)$ is minimax for all $i\geq 0$ and for any finitely generated $R$-module $N$ with $\Supp_R(N) \subseteq V (\fa)$ and $\dim N \leq 1$. As a consequence of this result we obtain that for any $\fa$-torsion $R$-module $M$ that $\Ext^i_R(R/\fa, M)$ is minimax for all $i\leq \dim M$, all Bass numbers and all Betti numbers of $M$ are finite. This generalizes \cite[Corollary 2.7]{BNS2015}. Also, some equivalent conditions for the cominimaxness of local cohomology modules with respect to ideals of dimension at most one are given.;math.AC
1801.07761;Interpolation and sampling sequences for mixed-norm spaces;This paper extends the known characterization of interpolation and sampling sequences for Bergman spaces to the mixed-norm spaces. The Bergman spaces have conformal invariance properties not shared by the mixed-norm spaces. As a result, different techniques of proof were required.;math.CV
1801.07764;Fixed point, Gregus-Ciric-contraction, monotone mappings, weighted graph;In this paper, we introduce the concept of monotone Gregus-\'Ciri\'c-contraction mappings in weighted digraphs. Then we establish a fixed point theorem for monotone Gregus-\'Ciri\'c-contraction mappings defined in convex weighted digraphs.;math.FA
1801.07766;A convergence analysis of the method of codifferential descent;This paper is devoted to a detailed convergence analysis of the method of codifferential descent (MCD) developed by professor V.F. Demyanov for solving a large class of nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problems. We propose a generalization of the MCD that is more suitable for applications than the original method, and that utilizes only a part of a codifferential on every iteration, which allows one to reduce the overall complexity of the method. With the use of some general results on uniformly codifferentiable functions obtained in this paper, we prove the global convergence of the generalized MCD in the infinite dimensional case. Also, we propose and analyse a quadratic regularization of the MCD, which is the first general method for minimizing a codifferentiable function over a convex set. Apart from convergence analysis, we also discuss the robustness of the MCD with respect to computational errors, possible step size rules, and a choice of parameters of the algorithm. In the end of the paper we estimate the rate of convergence of the MCD for a class of nonsmooth nonconvex functions that arises, in particular, in cluster analysis. We prove that under some general assumptions the method converges with linear rate, and it convergence quadratically, provided a certain first order sufficient optimality condition holds true.;math.OC
1801.07768;Hartshorne&#x27,s questions and weakly cofiniteness;Let $R$ be a commutative Noetherian ring, $\fa$ be an ideal of $R$ and $M$ be an $R$-module. The main purpose of this paper is to answer the Hartshorn's questions in the class of weakly Laskerian modules. It is shown that if $s\geq 1$ is a positive integer such that $\Ext^j_R(R/\fa, M)$ is weakly Laskerian for all $j\leq s$ and the $R$-module $H^i_\fa(M)$ is $FD_{\leq 1}$ for all $i &lt, s$, then the $R$-module $H^i_\fa(M)$ is $\fa$-weakly cofinite for all $i &lt,s$. In addition, we show that the category of all $\fa$-weakly cofinite $FD_{\leq 1}$ $R$-modules is an Abelian subcategory of the category of all $R$-modules. Also, we prove that if $\Ext^i_R(R/\fa,M)$ is weakly Laskerian for all $i\leq \dim M$, then the $R$-module $\Ext^i_R(N,M)$ is weakly Laskerian for all $i\geq 0$ and for any finitely generated $R$-module $N$ with $\Supp_R(N) \subseteq V (\fa)$ and $\dim N \leq 1$.;math.AC
1801.07769;Smooth exact penalty functions II: a reduction to standard exact penalty functions;A new class of smooth exact penalty functions was recently introduced by Huyer and Neumaier. In this paper, we prove that the new smooth penalty function for a constrained optimization problem is exact if and only if the standard nonsmooth penalty function for this problem is exact. We also provide some estimates of the exact penalty parameter of the smooth penalty function, and, in particular, show that it asymptotically behaves as the square of the exact penalty parameter of the standard $\ell_1$ penalty function. We briefly discuss a simple way to reduce the exact penalty parameter of the smooth penalty function, and study the effect of nonlinear terms on the exactness of this function.;math.OC
1801.07770;Knot concordance in homology cobordisms;Let $\widehat{\mathcal{C}}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ denote the group of knots in homology spheres that bound homology balls, modulo smooth concordance in homology cobordisms. Answering a question of Matsumoto, the second author previously showed that the natural map from the smooth knot concordance group $\mathcal{C}$ to $\widehat{\mathcal{C}}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ is not surjective. Using tools from Heegaard Floer homology, we show that the cokernel of this map, which can be understood as the non-locally-flat piecewise-linear concordance group, is infinitely generated and contains elements of infinite order.;math.GT
1801.07771;Relatively free associative algebras of ranks 2 and 3 with Lie nilpotency identity and systems of generators for some T-spaces;We study relatively free associative algebras $F^{(n)}_r$ of ranks $r=2,3$ with the identity $[x_1,\dots, x_n]=0$ of Lie nilpotency of step $n\geqslant 3$ over a field $K$ of characteristic $\neq 2,3$. First we prove a Theorem on the inclusion $ T^{(m)}T^{(n)}\subseteq T^{(m+n-1)}$ for an associative algebra $A$ of rank $3$, where $T^{(n)}=T^{(n)}(A)$ is a T-ideal of $A$ generated by the commutator $[x_1,\dots, x_n]$, the restriction on rank is essential. Further, we describe 3-variable identities of the algebra $F^{(n)}$. In particular, the obtained description implies that $Z(F^{(n)}_r)=(T^{(n-1)}+Z_q)(F^{(n)}_r)$, where $p=\mathrm{char}(K)\geqslant 5$ and $q$ is a least power of $p$ such that $q\geqslant n-1$ and $Z_q$ is a T-space generated by $x^q$. We also prove the equality $Z(F^{(n)}_2)=F^{(n)}_2\cap Z(F^{(n)})$. Finally, we obtain certain generalizations and refinements of some results by A. V. Grishin and V. V. Shchigolev, respectively. For example, we prove that a unital algebra $F^{(n)}_2$ $(n\geqslant 4)$ over a field $K$ of characteristic $p\geqslant n$ possesses a finite strictly descending "composition" series of T-ideals $T^{(3)}=T_1\supset T_2\supset \dots \supset T_k\supset T_{k+1}=0$ such that each quotient $T_i/T_{i+1}$ does not contain any proper T-spaces. <br />Key words: Lie nilpotency identity, center, kernel, proper polynomial, 3-variable identity, T-space.;math.RA
1801.07777;On The Reliability Function of Discrete Memoryless Multiple-Access Channel with Feedback;We derive a lower and upper bound on the reliability function of discrete memoryless multiple-access channel (MAC) with noiseless feedback and variable-length codes (VLCs). For the upper-bound, we use proof techniques of Burnashev for the point-to-point case. Also, we adopt the techniques used to prove the converse for the feedback-capacity of MAC. For the lower-bound on the error exponent, we present a coding scheme consisting of a data and a confirmation stage. In the data stage, any arbitrary feedback capacity-achieving code is used. In the confirmation stage, each transmitter sends one bit of information to the receiver using a pair of codebooks of size two, one for each transmitter. The codewords at this stage are selected randomly according to an appropriately optimized joint probability distribution. The bounds increase linearly with respect to a specific Euclidean distance measure defined between the transmission rate pair and the capacity boundary. The lower and upper bounds match for a class of MACs.;cs.IT
1801.07780;Online Optimization with Predictions and Switching Costs: Fast Algorithms and the Fundamental Limit;This paper studies an online optimization problem with a finite prediction window of cost functions and additional switching costs on decisions. We propose two gradient-based online algorithms: Receding Horizon Gradient Descent (RHGD), and Receding Horizon Accelerated Gradient (RHAG). Both algorithms only require a finite number of projected gradient evaluations at each stage. We provide upper bounds on the dynamic regrets of the proposed algorithms and show that the regret upper bounds decay exponentially with the length of the prediction window. Moreover, we study the fundamental lower bound on the dynamic regret for a broad class of deterministic online algorithms. The lower bound is close to RHAG's regret upper bound, indicating that our gradient-based RHAG is a near-optimal online algorithm.

1801.07796;Linearized Filtering of Affine Processes Using Stochastic Riccati Equations;We consider an affine process $X$ which is only observed up to an additive white noise, and we ask for its law, for some time $t &gt, 0 $, conditional on all observations up to this time $ t $. This is a general, possibly high dimensional filtering problem which is not even locally approximately Gaussian, whence essentially only particle filtering methods remain as solution techniques. In this work we present an efficient numerical solution by introducing an approximate filter for which conditional characteristic functions can be calculated by solving a system of generalized Riccati differential equations depending on the observation and the process characteristics of the signal $X$. The quality of the approximation can be controlled by easily observable quantities in terms of a macro location of the signal in state space. Asymptotic techniques as well as maximization techniques can be directly applied to the solutions of the Riccati equations leading to novel very tractable filtering formulas. The efficiency of the method is illustrated with numerical experiments for Cox-Ingersoll-Ross and Wishart processes, for which Gaussian approximations usually fail.;math.PR
1801.07799;Koopman spectra in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces;Every invertible, measure-preserving dynamical system induces a Koopman operator, which is a linear, unitary evolution operator acting on the $L^2$ space of observables associated with the invariant measure. Koopman eigenfunctions represent the quasiperiodic, or non-mixing, component of the dynamics. The extraction of these eigenfunctions and their associated eigenfrequencies from a given time series is a non-trivial problem when the underlying system has a dense point spectrum, or a continuous spectrum behaving similarly to noise. This paper describes methods for identifying Koopman eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions from a discretely sampled time series generated by such a system with unknown dynamics. Our main result gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a Fourier function, defined on $N$ states sampled along an orbit of the dynamics, to be extensible to a Koopman eigenfunction on the whole state space, lying in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). In particular, we show that such an extension exists if and only if the RKHS norm of the Fourier function does not diverge as $ N \to \infty $, in which case the corresponding Fourier frequency is also a Koopman eigenfrequency. If such an RKHS extension does not exist, we can still construct an $L^2$ approximation of the eigenfunction. Numerical experiments on mixed-spectrum systems with weak periodic components demonstrate that this approach has significantly higher skill in identifying Koopman eigenfrequencies compared to conventional spectral estimation techniques based on the discrete Fourier transform.;math.DS
1801.07802;Phase transitions on C*-algebras arising from number fields and the generalized Furstenberg conjecture;In recent work, Cuntz, Deninger and Laca have studied the Toeplitz type C*-algebra associated to the affine monoid of algebraic integers in a number field, under a time evolution determined by the absolute norm. The KMS equilibrium states of their system are parametrized by traces on the C*-algebras of the semidirect products $J \rtimes O^*$ resulting from the multiplicative action of the units $O^*$ on integral ideals $J$ representing each ideal class. At each fixed inverse temperature $\beta &gt, 2$, the extremal equilibrium states correspond to extremal traces of $C^*(J\rtimes O^*)$. Here we undertake the study of these traces using the transposed action of $O^*$ on the duals $\hat J$ of the ideals and the recent characterization of traces on transformation group C*-algebras due to Neshveyev. We show that the extremal traces of $C^*(J\rtimes O^*)$ are parametrized by pairs consisting of an ergodic invariant measure for the action of $O^*$ on $\hat{J}$ together with a character of the isotropy subgroup associated to the support of this measure. For every ideal the dual group $\hat {J}$ is a d-torus on which $O^*$ acts by linear toral automorphisms. Hence, the problem of classifying all extremal traces is a generalized version of Furstenberg's celebrated $\times 2$ $\times 3$ conjecture. We classify the results for various number fields in terms of ideal class group, degree, and unit rank, and we point along the way the trivial, the intractable, and the conjecturally classifiable cases. At the topological level, it is possible to characterize the number fields for which infinite $O^*$-invariant sets are dense in $\hat{J} $, thanks to a theorem of Berend, as an application we give a description of the primitive ideal space of $C^*(J\rtimes O^*)$ for those number fields.;math.OA
1801.07808;Pebbling on Graph Products and other Binary Graph Constructions;Pebbling on graphs is a two-player game which involves repeatedly moving a pebble from one vertex to another by removing another pebble from the first vertex. The pebbling number $\pi(G)$ is the least number of pebbles required so that, regardless of the initial configuration of pebbles, a pebble can reach any vertex. Graham conjectured that the pebbling number for the cartesian product, $G \hspace{1mm}\square\hspace{1mm} H$, is bounded above by $\pi(G) \pi(H)$. We show that $\pi(G\hspace{1mm}\square\hspace{1mm} H) \le 2\pi(G) \pi(H)$ and, more sharply, that $\pi(G \hspace{1mm}\square\hspace{1mm} H) \le (\pi(G)+|G|) \pi(H)$. Furthermore, we provide similar results for other graph products and graph operations.;math.CO
1801.07809;Statistical Learning For DC Optimal Power Flow;The optimal power flow problem plays an important role in the market clearing and operation of electric power systems. However, with increasing uncertainty from renewable energy operation, the optimal operating point of the system changes more significantly in real-time. In this paper, we aim at developing control policies that are able to track the optimal set-point with high probability. The approach is based on the observation that the OPF solution corresponding to a certain uncertainty realization is a basic feasible solution, which provides an affine control policy. The optimality of this basis policy is restricted to uncertainty realizations that share the same set of active constraints. We propose an ensemble control policy that combines several basis policies to improve performance. Although the number of possible bases is exponential in the size of the system, we show that only a few of them are relevant to system operation. We adopt a statistical learning approach to learn these important bases, and provide theoretical results that validate our observations. For most systems, we observe that efficient ensemble policies constructed using as few as ten bases, are able to obtain optimal solutions with high probability.;math.OC
1801.07815;Multivariate approximations in Wasserstein distance by Stein&#x27,s method and Bismut&#x27,s formula;Stein's method has been widely used for probability approximations. However, in the multi-dimensional setting, most of the results are for multivariate normal approximation or for test functions with bounded second- or higher-order derivatives. For a class of multivariate limiting distributions, we use Bismut's formula in Malliavin calculus to control the derivatives of the Stein equation solutions by the first derivative of the test function. Combined with Stein's exchangeable pair approach, we obtain a general theorem for multivariate approximations with near optimal error bounds on the Wasserstein distance.We apply the theorem to the unadjusted Langevin algorithm.;math.PR
1801.07816;The Grassmannian complex and Goncharov&#x27,s motivic complex in weight 4;For a field $F$ and a given integer $n&gt,1$, Goncharov has given a complex $\Gamma_F(n)$ which he calls motivic and which he expects to rationally compute the weight $n$ motivic cohomology of $\text{Spec }F$, and hence its algebraic $K$-groups in Adams weight $n$, and he was also led to---conjecturally quasiisomorphic---`thickened' complexes thereof. These complexes involve tensor products of higher Bloch groups, the latter having been linked to the geometry of certain configurations in Goncharov's proof of Zagier's Polylogarithm Conjecture for weight 3, and an analogous picture has long been envisioned by Goncharov for higher weight as well. <br />We provide a partial morphism in weight 4 by giving three out of four maps for configurations in general position.;math.NT
1801.07819;The Zilber-Pink Conjecture and the Generalized Cosmetic Surgery Conjecture;In this paper, we generalize the Cosmetic Surgery Conjecture to an $n$-cusped hyperbolic $3$-manifold and prove it under the assumption of another well-known conjecture in number theory, so called the Zilber-Pink Conjecture. For $n=1$ and $2$, we show them without the assumption.;math.GT
1801.07821;A counterexample to Matsumoto&#x27,s conjecture regarding absolute length vs. relative length in Finsler manifolds;Matsumoto conjectured that for any Finsler manifold $(M, F)$ for which the restriction of the fundamental tensor to the indicatrix of $F$ is positive definite, the absolute length $F(X)$ of any tangent vector $X \in T_xM$ is the global minimum for the relative length $|X|_y$ as $y$ varies along the indicatrix $I_x \subset T_xM$ of $F$. In this note, we disprove this conjecture by presenting a counterexample.;math.DG
1801.07830;Singular integrals of stable subordinator;It is well known that $\int_{0}^{1} t^{-\theta} d t&lt,\infty$ for $\theta \in (0,1)$ and $\int_{0}^{1} t^{-\theta} d t=\infty$ for $\theta \in [1,\infty)$. Since $t$ can be taken as an $\alpha$-stable subordinator with $\alpha=1$, it is natural to ask whether $\int_{0}^{1} t^{-\theta} d S_{t}$ has a similar property when $S_{t}$ is an $\alpha$-stable subordinator with $\alpha \in (0,1)$. We show that $\theta=\frac 1\alpha$ is the border line such that $\int_{0}^{1} t^{-\theta} d S_{t}$ is finite a.s. for $\theta \in (0, \frac 1\alpha)$ and blows up a.s. for $\theta \in [\frac1\alpha,\infty)$. When $\alpha=1$, our result recovers that of $\int_{0}^{1} t^{-\theta} d t$. Moreover, we give a $p$-th moment estimate for the integral when $\theta \in (0,\frac 1\alpha)$.;math.PR
1801.07836;Large spectral gaps for Steklov eigenvalues under volume constraints and under localized conformal deformations;In this paper we construct compact manifolds with fixed boundary geometry which admit Riemannian metrics of unit volume with arbitrarily large Steklov spectral gap. We also study the effect of localized conformal deformations that fix the boundary geometry. For instance, we prove that it is possible to make the spectral gap arbitrarily large using conformal deformations which are localized on domains of small measure, as long as the support of the deformations contains and connects each component of the boundary.;math.DG

We obtain new improved upper bounds for this sum, as well as for the corresponding energy integral. We also provide several new approaches to the only settled case of the conjecture: $d=1$.;math.MG

1801.07839;Improved list-decodability of random linear binary codes;There has been a great deal of work establishing that random linear codes are as list-decodable as uniformly random codes, in the sense that a random linear binary code of rate $1 - H(p) - \epsilon$ is $(p,O(1/\epsilon))$-list-decodable with high probability. In this work, we show that such codes are $(p, H(p)/\epsilon + 2)$-list-decodable with high probability, for any $p \in (0, 1/2)$ and $\epsilon &gt, 0$. In addition to improving the constant in known list-size bounds, our argument, which is quite simple, works simultaneously for all values of $p$, while previous works obtaining $L = O(1/\epsilon)$ patched together different arguments to cover different parameter regimes. <br />Our approach is to strengthen an existential argument of (Guruswami, H{\aa}stad, Sudan and Zuckerman, IEEE Trans. IT, 2002) to hold with high probability. To complement our upper bound for random linear codes, we also improve an argument of (Guruswami, Narayanan, IEEE Trans. IT, 2014) to obtain an essentially tight lower bound of $1/\epsilon$ on the list size of uniformly random codes, this implies that random linear codes are in fact more list-decodable than uniformly random codes, in the sense that the list sizes are strictly smaller. <br />To demonstrate the applicability of these techniques, we use them to (a) obtain more information about the distribution of list sizes of random linear codes and (b) to prove a similar result for random linear rank-metric codes.;cs.IT
1801.07852;Relaxed Schroedinger bridges and robust network routing;We consider network routing under random link failures with a desired final distribution. We provide a mathematical formulation of a relaxed transport problem where the final distribution only needs to be close to the desired one. The problem is a maximum entropy problem for path distributions with an extra terminal cost. We show that the unique solution may be obtained solving a generalized Schroedinger system. An iterative algorithm to compute the solution is provided. It contracts the Hilbert metric with contraction ratio less than 1/2 leading to extremely fast convergence.;math.OC
1801.07854;Chorded pancyclicity in $k$-partite graphs;We prove that for any integers $p\geq k\geq 3$ and any $k$-tuple of positive integers $(n_1,\ldots ,n_k)$ such that $p=\sum _{i=1}^k{n_i}$ and $n_1\geq n_2\geq \ldots \geq n_k$, the condition $n_1\leq {p\over 2}$ is necessary and sufficient for every subgraph of the complete $k$-partite graph $K(n_1,\ldots ,n_k)$ with at least \[{{4 -2p+2n_1+\sum _{i=1}^{k} n_i(p-n_i)}\over 2}\] edges to be chorded pancyclic. Removing all but one edge incident with any vertex of minimum degree in $K(n_1,\ldots ,n_k)$ shows that this result is best possible. Our result implies that for any integers, $k\geq 3$ and $n\geq 1$, a balanced $k$-partite graph of order $kn$ with has at least ${{(k^2-k)n^2-2n(k-1)+4}\over 2}$ edges is chorded pancyclic. In the case $k=3$, this result strengthens a previous one by Adamus, who in 2009 showed that a balanced tripartite graph of order $3n$, $n \geq 2$, with at least $3n^2 - 2n + 2$ edges is pancyclic.;math.CO
1801.07857;An accurate spectral method for Maxwell equations in Cole-Cole dispersive media;In this paper, we propose an accurate numerical means built upon a spectral-Galerkin method in spatial discretization and an enriched multi-step spectral-collocation approach in temporal direction, for Maxwell equations in Cole-Cole dispersive media in two-dimensional setting. Our starting point is to derive a new model involving only one unknown field from the original model with three unknown fields: electric, magnetic fields and the induced electric polarisation (described by a global temporal convolution of the electric field). This results in a second-order integral-differential equation with a weakly singular integral kernel expressed by the Mittag-Lefler (ML) function. The most interesting but challenging issue resides in how to efficiently deal with the singularity in time induced by the ML function which is an infinite series of singular power functions with different nature. With this in mind, we introduce a spectral-Galerkin method using Fourier-like basis functions for spatial discretization, leading to a sequence of decoupled temporal integral-differential equations (IDE) with the same weakly singular kernel involving the ML function as the original two-dimensional problem. With a careful study of the regularity of IDE, we incorporate several leading singular terms into the numerical scheme and approximate much regular part of the solution. Then we solve to IDE by a multi-step well-conditioned collocation scheme together with mapping technique to increase the accuracy and enhance the resolution. We show such an enriched collocation method is convergent and accurate. % analysis of the scheme is carried out.;math.NA
1801.07858;Equidistribution of toral eigenfunctions along hypersurfaces;We prove a new quantum variance estimate for toral eigenfunctions. As an application, we show that, given any orthonormal basis of toral eigenfunctions and any smooth embedded hypersurface with nonvanishing principal curvatures, there exists a density one subsequence of eigenfunctions that equidistribute along the hypersurface. This is an analogue of the Quantum Ergodic Restriction theorems in the case of the flat torus, which in particular verifies the Bourgain-Rudnick's conjecture on $L^2$-restriction estimates for a density one subsequence of eigenfunctions in any dimension. Using our quantum variance estimates, we also obtain equidistribution of eigenfunctions against measures whose supports have Fourier dimension larger than $d-2$. In the end, we also describe a few quantitative results specific to dimension $2$.;math.AP
1801.07862;Downlink Power Control in Massive MIMO Networks with Distributed Antenna Arrays;In this paper, we investigate downlink power control in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks with distributed antenna arrays. The base station (BS) in each cell consists of multiple antenna arrays, which are deployed in arbitrary locations within the cell. Due to the spatial separation between antenna arrays, the large-scale propagation effect is different from a user to different antenna arrays in a cell, which makes power control a challenging problem as compared to conventional massive MIMO. We assume that the BS in each cell obtains the channel estimates via uplink pilots. Based on the channel estimates, the BSs perform maximum ratio transmission for the downlink. We then derive a closed-form spectral efficiency (SE) expression, where the channels are subject to correlated fading. Utilizing the derived expression, we propose a max-min power control algorithm to ensure that each user in the network receives a uniform quality of service. Numerical results demonstrate that, for the network considered in this work, optimizing for max-min SE through the max-min power control improves the sum SE of the network as compared to equal power allocation.;cs.IT
1801.07865;Further Progress on the GM-MDS Conjecture for Reed-Solomon Codes;Designing good error correcting codes whose generator matrix has a support constraint, i.e., one for which only certain entries of the generator matrix are allowed to be non-zero, has found many recent applications, including in distributed coding and storage, multiple access networks, and weakly secure data exchange. The dual problem, where the parity check matrix has a support constraint, comes up in the design of locally repairable codes. The central problem here is to design codes with the largest possible minimum distance, subject to the given support constraint on the generator matrix. An upper bound on the minimum distance can be obtained through a set of singleton bounds, which can be alternatively thought of as a cut-set bound. Furthermore, it is well known that, if the field size is large enough, any random generator matrix obeying the support constraint will achieve the maximum minimum distance with high probability. Since random codes are not easy to decode, structured codes with efficient decoders, e.g., Reed-Solomon codes, are much more desirable. The GM-MDS conjecture of Dau et al states that the maximum minimum distance over all codes satisfying the generator matrix support constraint can be obtained by a Reed Solomon code. If true, this would have significant consequences. The conjecture has been proven for several special case: when the dimension of the code k is less than or equal to five, when the number of distinct support sets on the rows of the generator matrix m, say, is less than or equal to three, or when the generator matrix is sparsest and balanced. In this paper, we report on further progress on the GM-MDS conjecture. In particular, we show that the conjecture is true for all m less than equal to six. This generalizes all previous known results (except for the sparsest and balanced case, which is a very special support constraint).;cs.IT
1801.07877;Optimal Spectrum Sharing with ARQ based Legacy Users via Chain Decoding;This paper investigates the design of access policies in spectrum sharing networks by exploiting the retransmission protocol of legacy primary users (PUs) to improve the spectral efficiency via opportunistic retransmissions at secondary users (SUs) and chain decoding. The optimal policy maximizing the SU throughput under an interference constraint to the PU and its performance are found in closed form. It is shown that the optimal policy randomizes among three modes: Idle, the SU remains idle over the retransmission window of the PU, to avoid causing interference, Interference cancellation, the SU transmits only after decoding the PU packet, to improve its own throughput via interference cancellation, Always transmit, the SU transmits over the retransmission window of the PU to maximize the future potential of interference cancellation via chain decoding. This structure is exploited to design a stochastic optimization algorithm to facilitate learning and adaptation when the model parameters are unknown or vary over time, based on ARQ feedback from the PU and CSI measurements at the SU receiver. It is shown numerically that, for a 10% interference constraint, the optimal access policy yields 15% improvement over a state-of-the-art scheme without SU retransmissions, and up to 2x gain over a scheme using a non-adaptive access policy instead of the optimal one.;cs.IT
1801.07879;Bochner-Simons formulas and the rigidity of biharmonic submanifolds;We find some integral formulas of Simons and Bochner type and use them to study biharmonic and biconservative submanifolds in space forms.

1801.07882;Invariance principle for non-homogeneous random walks;We prove an invariance principle for a class of zero-drift spatially non-homogeneous random walks in $\mathbb{R}^d$, which may be recurrent in any dimension. The limit $\mathcal{X}$ is an elliptic martingale diffusion, which may be point-recurrent at the origin for any $d\geq2$. To characterise $\mathcal{X}$, we introduce a (non-Euclidean) Riemannian metric on the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and use it to express a related spherical diffusion as a Brownian motion with drift. This representation allows us to establish the skew-product decomposition of the excursions of $\mathcal{X}$ and thus develop the excursion theory of $\mathcal{X}$ without appealing to the strong Markov property. This leads to the uniqueness in law of the stochastic differential equation for $\mathcal{X}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, whose coefficients are discontinuous at the origin. Using the Riemannian metric we can also detect whether the angular component of the excursions of $\mathcal{X}$ is time-reversible. If so, the excursions of $\mathcal{X}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ generalise the classical Pitman-Yor splitting-at-the-maximum property of Bessel excursions.;math.PR
1801.07884;Joint Pilot and Payload Power Control for Uplink MIMO-NOMA with MRC-SIC Receivers;This letter proposes a joint pilot and payload power allocation (JPA) scheme to mitigate the error propagation problem for uplink multiple-input multiple-output non-orthogonal multiple access (MIMO-NOMA) systems. A base station equipped with a maximum ratio combining and successive interference cancellation (MRC-SIC) receiver is adopted for multiuser detection. The average signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (ASINR) of each user during the MRC-SIC decoding is analyzed by taking into account the error propagation due to the channel estimation error. Furthermore, the JPA design is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem to maximize the minimum weighted ASINR and is solved optimally with geometric programming. Simulation results confirm the developed performance analysis and show that our proposed scheme can effectively alleviate the error propagation of MRC-SIC and enhance the detection performance, especially for users with moderate energy budgets.;cs.IT
1801.07890;Conditional stability for backward parabolic equations with Osgood coefficients;The interest of the scientific community for the existence, uniqueness and stability of solutions to PDE's is testified by the numerous works available in the literature. In particular, in some recent publications on the subject an inequality guaranteeing stability is shown to hold provided that the coefficients of the principal part of the differential operator are Log-Lipschitz continuous. Herein this result is improved along two directions. First, we describe how to construct an operator, whose coefficients in the principal part are not Log-Lipschitz continuous, for which the above mentioned inequality does not hold. Second, we show that the stability of the solution is guaranteed, in a suitable functional space, if the coefficients of the principal part are Osgood continuous.;math.AP

This equation has an hypoelliptic structure. As an application of this Schauder estimate, we prove the global well-posedness of a toy nonlinear model in kinetic theory. This nonlinear model consists in a non-linear kinetic Fokker-Planck equation whose steady states are Maxwellian and whose diffusion in the velocity variable is proportional to the mass of the solution.;math.AP
1801.07895;Strichartz estimates for homogeneous repulsive potentials;The homogeneous repulsive potentials accelerate a quantum particle and the velocity of the particle increases exponentially in $t$, this phenomenon yields the fast decaying dispersive estimates and hence we consider the Strichartz estimates associated with this phenomenon. <br />First, we consider the free repulsive Hamiltonian and prove that the Strichartz estimates hold for every admissible pairs $(q,r)$, which satisfy $1/q +n/(2r) \geq n/4$ with $q$, $r \geq 2$. <br />Second, we consider the perturbed repulsive Hamiltonian with the slowly decaying potential such that $|V(x)| \leq C(1+|x|)^{-\delta}$ for some $\delta &gt,0$, and prove the Strichartz estimate with the same admissible pairs for the free case.;math.AP

1801.07902;Estimation of weak ARMA models with regime changes;In this paper we derive the asymptotic properties of the least squares estimator (LSE) of autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) models with regime changes under the assumption that the errors are uncorrelated but not necessarily independent. Relaxing the independence assumption considerably extends the range of application of the class of ARMA models with regime changes. Conditions are given for the consistency and asymptotic normality of the LSE. A particular attention is given to the estimation of the asymptotic covariance matrix, which may be very different from that obtained in the standard framework. The theoretical results are illustrated by means of Monte Carlo experiments.;math.ST

1801.07916;Lovasz-Saks-Schrijver ideals and coordinate sections of determinantal varieties;Motivated by questions in algebra and combinatorics we study two ideals associated to a simple graph G: <br />--&gt, the Lovasz-Saks-Schrijver ideal defining the d-dimensional orthogonal representations of the graph complementary to G and <br />--&gt, the determinantal ideal of the (d+1)-minors of a generic symmetric with 0s in positions prescribed by the graph G. <br />In characteristic 0 these two ideals turns out to be closely related and algebraic properties such as being radical, prime or a complete intersection transfer from the Lovasz-Saks-Schrijver ideal to the determinantal ideal. For Lovasz-Saks-Schrijver ideals we link these properties to combinatorial properties of G and show that they always hold for d large enough. For specific classes of graph, such a forests, we can give a complete picture and classify the radical, prime and complete intersection Lovasz-Saks-Schrijver ideals.;math.AC
1801.07918;Overgroups of exterior powers of an elementary group. I. Levels and normalizers;In the present paper, we prove the first part in the standard description of groups $H$ lying between $m$-th exterior power of elementary group $E(n,R)$ and the general linear group $GL_{\binom{n}{m}}(R)$. We study structure of the exterior power of elementary group and its relative analog $E\left(\binom{n}{m},R,A\right)$. In the considering case $n \geq 3m$, the description is explained by the classical notion of level: for every such $H$ we find unique ideal $A$ of the ring $R$. Motivated by the problem, we prove the coincidence of the following groups: normalizer of the exterior power of elementary group, normalizer of the exterior power of special linear group, transporter of the exterior power of elementary group into the exterior power of special linear group, and an exterior power of general linear group. This result mainly follows from the found explicit equations for the exterior power of algebraic group scheme $GL_n(\_)$.;math.GR
1801.07921;The point-interaction approximation for the fields generated by contrasted bubbles at arbitrary fixed frequencies;We deal with the linearized model of the acoustic wave propagation generated by small bubbles in the harmonic regime. We estimate the waves generated by a cluster of $M$ small bubbles, distributed in a bounded domain $\Omega$, with relative densities having contrasts of the order $a^{\beta}, \beta&gt,0, $ where $a$ models their relative maximum diameter, $a\ll 1$. We provide useful and natural conditions on the number $M$, the minimum distance and the contrasts parameter $\beta$ of the small bubbles under which the point interaction approximation (called also the Foldy-Lax approximation) is valid. <br />With the regimes allowed by our conditions, we can deal with a general class of such materials. Applications of these expansions in material sciences and imaging are immediate. For instance, they are enough to derive and justify the effective media of the cluster of the bubbles for a class of gases with densities having contrasts of the order $a^{\beta}$, $\beta \in (\frac{3}{2}, 2)$ and in this case we can handle any fixed frequency. In the particular and important case $\beta=2$, we can handle any fixed frequency far or close (but distinct) from the corresponding Minnaert resonance. The cluster of the bubbles can be distributed to generate volumetric metamaterials but also low dimensional ones as metascreens and metawires.;math.AP
1801.07922;Gradient-based dimension reduction of multivariate vector-valued functions;Multivariate functions encountered in high-dimensional uncertainty quantification problems often vary most strongly along a few dominant directions in the input parameter space. We propose a gradient-based method for detecting these directions and using them to construct ridge approximations of such functions, in the case where the functions are vector-valued (e.g., taking values in $\mathbb{R}^n$). The methodology consists of minimizing an upper bound on the approximation error, obtained by subspace Poincar\'e inequalities. We provide a thorough mathematical analysis in the case where the parameter space is equipped with a Gaussian probability measure. The resulting method generalizes the notion of active subspaces associated with scalar-valued functions. A numerical illustration shows that using gradients of the function yields effective dimension reduction. We also show how the choice of norm on the codomain of the function has an impact on the function's low-dimensional approximation.;math.AP
1801.07924;Automorphisms with eigenvalues in $S^1$ of a ${\mathbb Z}$-lattice with cyclic finite monodromy;For any finite set $M\subset {\mathbb Z}_{\geq 1}$ of positive integers, there is up to isomorphism a unique ${\mathbb Z}$-lattice $H_M$ with a cyclic automorphism $h_M:H_M\to H_M$ whose eigenvalues are the unit roots with orders in $M$ and have multiplicity 1. The paper studies the automorphisms of the pair $(H_M,h_M)$ which have eigenvalues in $S^1$. The main result are necessary and sufficient conditions on the set $M$ such that the only such automorphisms are $\pm h_M^k,k\in{\mathbb Z}$. The proof uses resultants and cyclotomic polynomials. It is elementary, but involved. Special cases of the main result have been applied to the study of the automorphisms of Milnor lattices of isolated hypersurface singularities.;math.NT
1801.07925;Stability of the 2+2 fermionic system with point interactions;We give a lower bound on the ground state energy of a system of two fermions of one species interacting with two fermions of another species via point interactions. We show that there is a critical mass ratio m_c \approx 0.58 such that the system is stable, i.e., the energy is bounded from below, for m \in [m_c, m_c^{-1}]. So far it was not known whether this 2+2 system exhibits a stable region at all or whether the formation of four-body bound states causes an unbounded spectrum for all mass ratios, similar to the Thomas effect. Our result gives further evidence for the stability of the more general N+M system.;math-ph
1801.07930;The cohomology rings of regular nilpotent Hessenberg varieties and Schubert polynomials;In this paper we study a relation between the cohomology ring of a regular nilpotent Hessenberg variety and Schubert polynomials. To describe an explicit presentation of the cohomology ring of a regular nilpotent Hessenberg variety, polynomials $f_{i,j}$ were introduced by Abe-Harada-Horiguchi-Masuda. We show that every polynomial $f_{i,j}$ is an alternating sum of certain Schubert polynomials.;math.AG
1801.07931;On tail behaviour of stationary second-order Galton-Watson processes with immigration;A second-order Galton-Watson process with immigration can be represented as a coordinate process of a 2-type Galton-Watson process with immigration. Sufficient conditions are derived on the offspring and immigration distributions of a second-order Galton-Watson process with immigration under which the corresponding 2-type Galton-Watson process with immigration has a unique stationary distribution such that its common marginals are regularly varying. In the course of the proof sufficient conditions are given under which the distribution of a second-order Galton-Watson process (without immigration) at any fixed time is regularly varying provided that the initial sizes of the population are regularly varying.;math.PR
1801.07933;Variational multi-scale spectral solution of convection-dominated parabolic problems;In this work, we consider an extension to parabolic problems of the variational multiscale method with spectral approximation of the sub-scales. We first discretize in time using a finite difference scheme and second, apply the generalization of the spectral variational multi-scale method. To obtain error estimations in convection-dominated flows, we find a helpful link between the stabilized term expressed in terms of Green's functions and in terms of spectral functions. Finally, we present some numerical tests to show the reliability of the method. We consider the stationary one-dimensional advection-diffusion-reaction equation and the evolutive one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation.;math.NA
1801.07940;The minimum principle for affine functions with the point of continuity property and isomorphisms of spaces of continuous affine function;Let X be a compact convex set and let ext X stand for the set of extreme points of X. We show that an affine function with the point of continuity property on X satisfies the minimum principle. As a corollary we obtain a generalization of a theorem by H.B. Cohen and C.H. Chu by proving the following result. Let X,Y be compact convex sets such that every extreme point of X and Y is a weak peak point and let the Banach-Mazur distance between spaces of affine continuous functions on X and Y is smaller then 2. Then ext X is homeomorphic to ext Y.;math.FA
1801.07944;On a Problem of Janusz Matkowski and Jacek Weso&#x142,owski, II;We continue our study started in "On a problem of Janusz Matkowski and Jacek Weso{\l}owski" (see <a href="/abs/1703.08459">arXiv:1703.08459</a>) of the functional equation \begin{equation*} \varphi(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{N}\varphi(f_n(x))-\sum_{n=0}^{N}\varphi(f_n(0)) \end{equation*} and its increasing and continuous solutions $\varphi\colon[0,1]\to[0,1]$ such that $\varphi(0)=0$ and $\varphi(1)=1$. In this paper we assume that $f_0,\ldots,f_N\colon[0,1]\to[0,1]$ are strictly increasing contractions such that \begin{equation*} 0\leq f_0(0)&lt,f_0(1)\leq f_1(0)&lt,\cdots &lt,f_{N-1}(1)\leq f_N(0)&lt,f_N(1)\leq 1 \end{equation*} and at least one of the weak inequalities is strong.;math.CA
1801.07949;Congruences Modulo Powers of 3 for 3- and 9-Colored Generalized Frobenius Partitions;Let $c\phi_{k}(n)$ be the number of $k$-colored generalized Frobenius partitions of $n$. We establish some infinite families of congruences for $c\phi_{3}(n)$ and $c\phi_{9}(n)$ modulo arbitrary powers of 3, which refine the results of Kolitsch. For example, for $k\ge 3$ and $n\ge 0$, we prove that \[c\phi_{3}\Big(3^{2k}n+\frac{7\cdot 3^{2k}+1}{8}\Big) \equiv 0 \pmod{3^{4k+5}}.\] We give two different proofs to the congruences satisfied by $c\phi_{9}(n)$. One of the proofs uses an relation between $c\phi_{9}(n)$ and $c\phi_{3}(n)$ due to Kolitsch, for which we provide a new proof in this paper.;math.CO
1801.07952;On the infimum convolution inequalities with improved constants;The goal of the article is to improve constants in the infimum convolution inequalities (IC for short) which were introduced by R. Lata{\l}a and J.O. Wojtaszczyk. We show that the exponential distribution satisfies IC with constant $2$ but not with constant $1$, which implies that linear functions are not extremal in Maurey's property $(\tau)$. Using transport of measure we use this result to better constants in the IC inequalities for product symmetric log-concave measures as well as in the Talagrand's two level concentration inequality for the exponential distribution.;math.PR
1801.07953;The applications of Cauchy-Schwartz inequality for Hilbert modules to elementary operators and i.p.t.i. transformers;We apply the inequality $\left|\left&lt,x,y\right&gt,\right|\le\|x\|\,\left&lt,y,y\right&gt,^{1/2}$ to give an easy and elementary proof of many operator inequalities for elementary operators and inner type product integral transformers obtained during last two decades, which also generalizes all of them.;math.FA

1801.07969;On Uniqueness And Existence of Conformally Compact Einstein Metrics with Homogeneous Conformal Infinity. II;In this paper we show that for an $\text{Sp}(k+1)$ invariant metric $\hat{g}$ on $\mathbb{S}^{4k+3}$ $(k\geq 1)$ close to the round metric, the conformally compact Einstein (CCE) manifold $(M, g)$ with $(\mathbb{S}^{4k+3}, [\hat{g}])$ as its conformal infinity is unique up to isometries. Moreover, by the result in [LiQingShi], $g$ is the Graham-Lee metric on the unit ball $B_1\subset \mathbb{R}^{4k+4}$. We also give an a priori estimate on the Einstein metric $g$. Based on the estimate and Graham-Lee and Lee's seminal perturbation result, we use the continuity method directly to obtain an existence result of the non-positively curved CCE metric with prescribed conformal infinity $(\mathbb{S}^{4k+3}, [\hat{g}])$ when the metric $\hat{g}$ is $\text{Sp}(k+1)$-invariant.;math.DG
1801.07977;Existence of solutions to non-homogeneous higher order differential equation in the Schwartz space;There is studied problem on existence of solutions to non-homogeneous differential equation of higher even order. Similar problem arises while studying soliton and soliton-like solutions to partial differential equations of integrable type. <br />By means of Fourier transform and theory of pseudodifferential operators there is proved the theorem on necessary and sufficient conditions on existence of solutions to linear non-homogeneous differential equation of higher even order in the Schwartz space.;math-ph
1801.07980;Recurrence Relations for Wronskian Hermite Polynomials;We consider polynomials that are defined as Wronskians of certain sets of Hermite polynomials. Our main result is a recurrence relation for these polynomials in terms of those of one or two degrees smaller, which generalizes the well-known three term recurrence relation for Hermite polynomials. The polynomials are defined using partitions of natural numbers, and the coefficients in the recurrence relation can be expressed in terms of the number of standard Young tableaux of these partitions. Using the recurrence relation, we provide another recurrence relation and show that the average of the considered polynomials with respect to the Plancherel measure is very simple. Furthermore, we show that some existing results in the literature are easy corollaries of the recurrence relation.;math.CA
1801.07982;On iterated product sets with shifts;We prove that, for any finite set $A \subset \mathbb Q$ with $|AA| \leq K|A|$ and any positive integer $k$, the $k$-fold product set of the shift $A+1$ satisfies the bound $$| \{(a_1+1)(a_2+1) \cdots (a_k+1) : a_i \in A \}| \geq \frac{|A|^k}{(8k^4)^{kK}}. $$ This result is essentially optimal when $K$ is of the order $c\log|A|$, for a sufficiently small constant $c=c(k)$. <br />Our main tool is a multiplicative variant of the $\Lambda$-constants used in harmonic analysis, applied to Dirichlet polynomials.;math.NT
1801.07990;Gerstenhaber algebra and Deligne&#x27,s conjecture on Tate-Hochschild cohomology;Using non-commutative differential forms, we construct a complex called singular Hochschild cochain complex for any associative algebra over a field. The cohomology of this complex is isomorphic to the Tate-Hochschild cohomology in the sense of Buchweitz. By a natural action of the cellular chain operad of the spineless cacti operad, introduced by R. Kaufmann, on the singular Hochschild cochain complex, we provide a proof of the Deligne's conjecture for this complex. More concretely, the complex is an algebra over the (dg) operad of chains of the little $2$-discs operad. By this action, we also obtain that the singular Hochschild cochain complex has a $B$-infinity algebra structure and its cohomology ring is a Gerstenhaber algebra. <br />Inspired by the original definition of Tate cohomology for finite groups, we define a generalized Tate-Hochschild complex with the Hochschild chains in negative degrees and the Hochschild cochains in non-negative degrees. There is a natural embedding of this complex into the singular Hochschild cochain complex. In the case of a self-injective algebra, this embedding becomes a quasi-isomorphism. In particular, for a symmetric algebra, this allows us to show that the Tate-Hochschild cohomology ring, equipped with the Gerstenhaber algebra structure, is a Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra.;math.RT
1801.07991;Left-invariant almost para-complex structures on six-dimensional nilpotent Lie groups;There are five six-dimensional nilpotent Lie groups G, which do not admit neither symplectic, nor complex structures and, therefore, can be neither almost pseudo-Kahler, nor almost Hermitian. In this work, these Lie groups are being studied. The aim of the paper is to define new left-invariant geometric structures on the Lie groups under consideration that compensate, in some sense, the absence of symplectic and complex structures. New examples of multiparametric families of metrics of signature (3,3) and almost para-complex pseudo-Riemannian half-flat structures on six-dimensional nilmanifolds are obtained. These metrics have a diagonal Ricci operator with two eigenvalues, which differ only in sign.;math.DG
1801.07995;Change of rings and singularity categories;We investigate the behavior of singularity categories and stable categories of Gorenstein projective modules along a morphism of rings. The natural context to approach the problem is via change of rings, that is, the classical adjoint triple between the module categories. In particular, we identify conditions on the change of rings to induce functors between the two singularity categories or the two stable categories of Gorenstein projective modules. Moreover, we study this problem at the level of `big singularity categories' in the sense of Krause. Along the way we establish an explicit construction of a right adjoint functor between certain homotopy categories. This is achieved by introducing the notion of 0-cocompact objects in triangulated categories and proving a dual version of Bousfield's localization lemma. We provide applications and examples illustrating our main results.;math.RT
1801.07996;Topological rigidity for closed hypersurfaces of elliptic space forms;We prove a topological rigidity theorem for closed hypersurfaces of the Euclidean sphere and of an elliptic space form. It asserts that, under a lower bound hypothesis on the absolute value of the principal curvatures, the hypersurface is diffeomorphic to a sphere or to a quotient of a sphere by a group action. We also prove another topological rigidity result for hypersurfaces of the sphere that involves the spherical image of its usual Gauss map.;math.DG
1801.08000;Nonlocal criteria for compactness in the space of $L^{p}$ vector fields;This work presents a set of sufficient conditions that guarantee a compact inclusion in the function space of $L^p$ vector fields defined on a domain that is either a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ or $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ itself. The criteria are nonlocal and are given with respect to nonlocal interaction kernels that may not be necessarily radially symmetric. Moreover, these criteria for vector fields are also different from those given for scalar fields in that the conditions are based on nonlocal interactions involving only parts of the components of the vector fields.;math.AP
1801.08005;Boundary regularity for the porous medium equation;We study the boundary regularity of solutions to the porous medium equation $u_t = \Delta u^m$ in the degenerate range $m&gt,1$. In particular, we show that in cylinders the Dirichlet problem with positive continuous boundary data on the parabolic boundary has a solution which attains the boundary values, provided that the spatial domain satisfies the elliptic Wiener criterion. This condition is known to be optimal, and it is a consequence of our main theorem which establishes a barrier characterization of regular boundary points for general -- not necessarily cylindrical -- domains in ${\bf R}^{n+1}$. One of our fundamental tools is a new strict comparison principle between sub- and superparabolic functions, which makes it essential for us to study both nonstrict and strict Perron solutions to be able to develop a fruitful boundary regularity theory. Several other comparison principles and pasting lemmas are also obtained. In the process we obtain a rather complete picture of the relation between sub/super\-para\-bolic functions and weak sub/super\-solu\-tions.;math.AP
1801.08008;Cones generated by random points on half-spheres and convex hulls of Poisson point processes;Let $U_1,U_2,\ldots$ be random points sampled uniformly and independently from the $d$-dimensional upper half-sphere. We show that, as $n\to\infty$, the $f$-vector of the $(d+1)$-dimensional convex cone $C_n$ generated by $U_1,\ldots,U_n$ weakly converges to a certain limiting random vector, without any normalization. We also show convergence of all moments of the $f$-vector of $C_n$ and identify the limiting constants for the expectations. We prove that the expected Grassmann angles of $C_n$ can be expressed through the expected $f$-vector. This yields convergence of expected Grassmann angles and conic intrinsic volumes and answers thereby a question of B\'ar\'any, Hug, Reitzner and Schneider [Random points in halfspheres, Rand. Struct. Alg., 2017]. Our approach is based on the observation that the random cone $C_n$ weakly converges, after a suitable rescaling, to a random cone whose intersection with the tangent hyperplane of the half-sphere at its north pole is the convex hull of the Poisson point process with power-law intensity function proportional to $\|x\|^{-(d+\gamma)}$, where $\gamma=1$. We compute the expected number of facets, the expected intrinsic volumes and the expected $T$-functional of this random convex hull for arbitrary $\gamma&gt,0$.;math.PR
1801.08011;A Conceptual Conjugate Epi-Projection Algorithm of Convex Optimization: Superlinear, Quadratic and Finite Convergence;This paper considers a conceptual version of a convex optimization algorithm whic is based on replacing a convex optimization problem with the root-finding problem for the approximate sub-differential mapping which is solved by repeated projection onto the epigraph of conjugate function. Whilst the projection problem is not exactly solvable in finite space-time it can be approximately solved up to arbitrary precision by simple iterative methods, which use linear support functions of the epigraph. It seems therefore useful to study computational characteristics of the idealized version of this algorithm when projection on the epigraph is computed precisely to estimate the potential benefits for such development. The key results of this study are that the conceptual algorithm attains super-linear rate of convergence in general convex case, the rate of convergence becomes quadratic for objective functions forming super-set of strongly convex functions, and convergence is finite when objective function has sharp minimum. In all cases convergence is global and does not require differentiability of the objective. <br />Keywords: convex optimization, conjugate function, approximate sub-differential, super-linear convergence, quadratic convergence, finite convergence, projection, epigraph;math.OC
1801.08012;Existence of expanders of the harmonic map flow;We investigate the existence of weak expanding solutions of the harmonic map flow for maps with values into a smooth closed Riemannian manifold. We prove the existence of such solutions in case the target manifold is isometrically embedded as a hypersurface of some Euclidean space and the initial condition is a Lipschitz map that is homotopic to a constant.;math.DG
1801.08014;A Variation on Mills-Like Prime-Representing Functions;Mills showed that there exists a constant $A$ such that $\lfloor{A^{3^n}}\rfloor$ is prime for every positive integer $n$. Kuipers and Ansari generalized this result to $\lfloor{A^{c^n}}\rfloor$ where $c\in\mathbb{R}$ and $c\geq 2.106$. The main contribution of this paper is a proof that the function $\lceil{B^{c^n}}\rceil$ is also a prime-representing function, where $\lceil X\rceil$ denotes the ceiling or least integer function. Moreover, the first 10 primes in the sequence generated in the case $c=3$ are calculated. Lastly, the value of $B$ is approximated to the first $5500$ digits and is shown to begin with $1.2405547052\ldots$.;math.NT
1801.08015;Modules as exact functors;We can define a module to be an exact functor on a small abelian category.

A number of examples are worked through.;math.RT
1801.08016;An oscillatory Fermat-Torricelli tree in R^2;We obtain an important generalization of the mechanical solution given by S. Gueron and R. Tessler w.r. to the weighted Fermat-Torricelli problem which derives a new structure of solutions which may be called oscillatory Fermat-Torricelli trees. The weighted Fermat-Torricelli problem in R^2 states that: Given three points in R^2 and a positive real number (weight) which correspond to each point , find the point (weighted Fermat-Torricelli point) such that the sum of the weighted distances to these three points is minimized. By applying the mechanical device of Pick and Polya the oscillatory tree solution is a new solution w.r to the weighted Fermat-Torricelli problem for a given isosceles triangle with corresponding two equal weights at the vertices of the base segment. it is worth mentioning that after time t the oscillatory knot of the mechanical system passes from the weighted Fermat-Torricelli point with non zero velocity. Furthermore, we give a numerical example to verify the structure of an oscillatory Fermat-Torricelli tree for a given isosceles triangle with equal weights.;math.HO
1801.08017;Hall-Littlewood expansions of Schur delta operators at $t = 0$;For any Schur function $s_{\nu}$, the associated {\em delta operator} $\Delta'_{s_{\nu}}$ is a linear operator on the ring of symmetric functions which has the modified Macdonald polynomials as an eigenbasis. When $\nu = (1^{n-1})$ is a column of length $n-1$, the symmetric function $\Delta'_{e_{n-1}} e_n$ appears in the Shuffle Theorem of Carlsson-Mellit. More generally, when $\nu = (1^{k-1})$ is any column the polynomial $\Delta'_{e_{k-1}} e_n$ is the symmetric function side of the Delta Conjecture of Haglund-Remmel-Wilson. We give an expansion of $\omega \Delta'_{s_{\nu}} e_n$ at $t = 0$ in the dual Hall-Littlewood basis for any partition $\nu$. The Delta Conjecture at $t = 0$ was recently proven by Garsia-Haglund-Remmel-Yoo, our methods give a new proof of this result. We give an algebraic interpretation of $\omega \Delta'_{s_{\nu}} e_n$ at $t = 0$ in terms of a $\mathrm{Hom}$-space.;math.CO

This index now takes into account the mutual persuasion power matrix(PPM) existing among the voters. This improved index is calculated for European Union voting by basing the PPM on immigration data among the EU countries. We also provide better approximation bounds for the Monte Carlo approximation method for computing power indices.;math.CO
1801.08032;An extension of the Whittaker function;The Whittaker function and its diverse extensions have been actively investigated. Here we introduce an extension of the Whittaker function by using the known extended confluent hypergeometric function $\Phi_{p,v}$ and investigate some of its formulas such as integral representations, a transformation formula, Mellin transform, and a differential formula. Some special cases of our results are also considered.;math.CA
1801.08035;Almost Periodic Functions in terms of Bohr&#x27,s Equivalence Relation;In this paper we introduce an equivalence relation on the classes of almost periodic functions of a real or complex variable which is used to refine Bochner's result that characterizes these spaces of functions. In fact, with respect to the topology of uniform convergence, we prove that the limit points of the family of translates of an almost periodic function are precisely the functions which are equivalent to it, which leads us to a characterization of almost periodicity. In particular we show that any exponential sum which is equivalent to the Riemann zeta function, $\zeta(s)$, can be uniformly approximated in $\{s=\sigma+it:\sigma&gt,1\}$ by certain vertical translates of $\zeta(s)$.;math.CV
1801.08043;Toll number of the strong product of graphs;A tolled walk $T$ between two non-adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$ in a graph $G$ is a walk, in which $u$ is adjacent only to the second vertex of $T$ and $v$ is adjacent only to the second-to-last vertex of $T$. A toll interval between $u,v\in V(G)$ is a set $T_G(u,v)=\{x\in V(G)~|~x \textrm{ lies on a tolled walk between } u \textrm{\, and\,} v\}$. A set $S \subseteq V(G)$ is toll convex, if $T_{G}(u,v)\subseteq S$ for all $u,v\in S$. A toll closure of a set $S \subseteq V(G)$ is the union of toll intervals between all pairs of vertices from $S$. The size of a smallest set $S$ whose toll closure is the whole vertex set is called a toll number of a graph $G$, $tn(G)$. This paper investigates the toll number of the strong product of graphs. First, a description of toll intervals between two vertices in the strong product graphs is given. Using this result we characterize graphs with $tn(G \boxtimes H)=2$ and graphs with $tn(G \boxtimes H)=3$, which are the only two possibilities. As an addition, for the t-hull number of $G\boxtimes H $ we show that $th(G \boxtimes H) = 2$ for any non complete graphs $G$ and $H$. As extreme vertices play an important role in different convexity types, we show that no vertex of the strong product graph of two non complete graphs is an extreme vertex with respect to the toll convexity.;math.CO
1801.08046;On the nonarchimedean quadratic Lagrange spectra;We study Diophantine approximation in completions of functions fields over finite fields, and in particular in fields of formal Laurent series over finite fields. We introduce a Lagrange spectrum for the approximation by orbits of quadratic irrationals under the modular group. We give nonarchimedean analogs of various well known results in the real case: the closedness and boundedness of the Lagrange spectrum, the existence of a Hall ray, as well as computations of various Hurwitz constants. We use geometric methods of group actions on Bruhat-Tits trees.;math.NT
1801.08047;Proper actions on $\ell^p$ spaces for relatively hyperbolic groups;We show that for any group $G$ that is hyperbolic relative to subgroups that admit a proper affine isometric action on a uniformly convex Banach space, then $G$ acts properly on a uniformly convex Banach space as well.;math.GR

1801.08056;The ascent-plateau statistics on Stirling permutations;In this paper, several variants of the ascent-plateau statistic are introduced, including flag ascent-plateau, double ascent and descent-plateau. We first study the flag ascent-plateau statistic on Stirling permutations by using context-free grammars. We then present a unified refinement of the ascent polynomials and the ascent-plateau polynomials. In particular, by using Foata and Strehl's group action, we prove two bistatistics over the set of Stirling permutations of order n are equidistributed.;math.CO
1801.08059;Two-Stage Polarization-Based Nonbinary Polar Codes for 5G URLLC;In this paper, we propose a new class of nonbinary polar codes with two-stage polarization for ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC), where the outer (symbol-level) polarization is achieved by using a 2X2 q-ary matrix [1 0, \beta 1] as the kernel and the inner (bit-level) polarization is achieved by a binary polarization matrix for each input symbol. With the two-stage polarization, bit-level code construction is introduced, resulting in partially-frozen symbols, where the frozen bits in these symbols can be used as active-check bits to facilitate the decoder. The encoder/decoder of the proposed codes has the same structure as the original binary polar codes, admitting an easily configurable and flexible implementation, which is an obvious advantage over the existing nonbinary polar codes based on Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. To support high spectral efficiency in URLLC, we also present, in addition to the single level coded modulation scheme with field matched modulation order, a mixed multilevel coded modulation scheme with arbitrary modulation order to trade off the latency against complexity. Simulation results show that our proposed nonbinary polar codes exhibit comparable performance with the RS4-based polar codes and outperform binary polar codes with low decoding latency, suggesting a potential application for 5G URLLC.;cs.IT
1801.08060;Discretely self-similar solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations with data in $L^2_{\mathrm{loc}}$ satisfying the local energy inequality;Chae and Wolf recently constructed discretely self-similar solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations for any discretely self similar data in $L^2_{\mathrm{loc}}$. Their solutions are in the class of local Leray solutions with projected pressure, and satisfy the "local energy inequality with projected pressure". In this note, for the same class of initial data, we construct discretely self-similar suitable weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations that satisfy the classical local energy inequality of Scheffer and Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg. We also obtain an explicit formula for the pressure in terms of the velocity. Our argument involves a new purely local energy estimate for discretely self-similar solutions with data in $L^2_{\mathrm{loc}}$ and an approximation of divergence free, discretely self-similar vector fields in $L^2_{\mathrm{loc}}$ by divergence free, discretely self-similar elements of $L^3_w$.;math.AP
1801.08063;Doi-Peliti Path Integral Methods for Stochastic Systems with Partial Exclusion;Doi-Peliti methods are developed for stochastic models with finite maximum occupation numbers per site. We provide a generalized framework for the different Fock spaces reported in the literature. Paragrassmannian techniques are then utilized to construct path integral formulations of factorial moments. We show that for many models of interest, a Magnus expansion is required to construct a suitable action, meaning actions containing a finite number of terms are not always feasible. However, for such systems, perturbative techniques are still viable, and for some examples, including carrying capacity population dynamics, and diffusion with partial exclusion, the expansions are exactly summable.;math-ph
1801.08070;Large deviations and wandering exponent for random walk in a dynamic beta environment;Random walk in a dynamic i.i.d. beta random environment, conditioned to escape at an atypical velocity, converges to a Doob transform of the original walk. The Doob-transformed environment is correlated in time, i.i.d. in space, and its marginal density function is a product of a beta density and a hypergeometric function. Under its averaged distribution the transformed walk obeys the wandering exponent 2/3 that agrees with Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality. The harmonic function in the Doob transform comes from a Busemann-type limit and appears as an extremal in a variational problem for the quenched large deviation rate function.;math.PR
1801.08071;An $A_{\infty}$-coalgebra Structure on a Closed Compact Surface;Let $P$ be an $n$-gon with $n\geq3.$ There is a formal combinatorial $A_\infty$-coalgebra structure on cellular chains $C_*(P)$ with non-vanishing higher order structure when $n\geq5$. If $X_g$ is a closed compact surface of genus $g\geq2$ and $P_g$ is a polygonal decomposition, the quotient map $q:P_g\to X_g$ projects the formal $A_\infty$-coalgebra structure on $C_*(P_g)$ to a quotient structure on $C_*(X_g)$, which persists to homology $H_{\ast}\left( X_g,\mathbb{Z}_{2}\right) $, whose operations are determined by the quotient map $q$, and whose higher order structure is non-trivial if and only if $X_g$ is orientable or unorientable with $g\geq3$. But whether or not the $A_{\infty}$-coalgebra structure on homology observed here is topologically invariant is an open question.;math.AT
1801.08072;A framework for rank identities -- With a view towards operator algebras;For every square matrix $A$ over a field $\mathbb{K}$, we have the equality $\mathrm{rank}(A) + \mathrm{rank}(I-A) = \mathrm{rank}(I) + \mathrm{rank}(A-A^2)$. In this article, we start a program to systematically characterize and generalize such rank identities with a view towards applications to operator algebras. We initiate the study of so-called ranked rings (unital rings with a `rank-system'), the main examples of interest being finite von Neumann algebras and Murray-von Neumann algebras. In our framework, a field $\mathbb{K}$ may be viewed as a ranked ring with a $\mathbb{Z}^+$-valued rank-system consisting of the usual rank functions on $M_n(\mathbb{K})$ (for $n \in \mathbb{N})$ and serves as the motivating example. We show that a finite von Neumann algebra $\mathscr{R}$ with center $\mathscr{C}$ (and the corresponding Murray-von Neumann algebra $\mathscr{R}_{\textrm{aff}}$) may be endowed with a $\mathscr{C}^{+}$-valued rank-system, considering $\mathscr{C}^{+}$ as a commutative monoid with respect to operator addition. We give an algorithm to generate rank identities in ranked $\mathbb{K}$-algebras via the polynomial function calculus, and in ranked complex Banach algebras via the holomorphic function calculus. As an illustrative application, using these abstract rank identities we show that the sum of finitely many (not necessarily self-adjoint) idempotents $E_1, \cdots, E_m$ in a finite von Neumann algebra is an idempotent if and only if they are mutually orthogonal, that is, $E_i E_j = \delta_{ij}E_i$ for $1\le i, j \le m$. In contrast, this does not hold in general in the ring of bounded operators on an infinite-dimensional complex Hilbert space.;math.RA
1801.08074;Non-parametric Estimation of Mutual Information with Application to Nonlinear Optical Fibers;This paper compares and evaluates a set of non-parametric mutual information estimators with the goal of providing a novel toolset to progress in the analysis of the capacity of the nonlinear optical channel, which is currently an open problem. In the first part of the paper, the methods of the study are presented. The second part details their application to several optically-related channels to highlight their features.;cs.IT
1801.08077;An inequality of type sup+inf on $S_4$ for the Paneitz operator;We give a sup+inf inequality on $S_4$ for Paneitz operator.;math.AP
1801.08091;On Weak Supercyclicity I;This paper provides conditions (i) to distinguish weak supercyclicity form supercyclicity for operators acting on normed and Banach spaces, and also (ii) to ensure when weak supercyclicity implies weak stability.;math.FA
1801.08095;The Helmholtz equation in heterogeneous media: a priori bounds, well-posedness, and resonances;We consider the exterior Dirichlet problem for the heterogeneous Helmholtz equation, i.e. the equation $\nabla\cdot(A \nabla u ) + k^2 n u =-f$ where both $A$ and $n$ are functions of position. We prove new a priori bounds on the solution under conditions on $A$, $n$, and the domain that ensure nontrapping of rays, the novelty is that these bounds are explicit in $k$, $A$, $n$, and geometric parameters of the domain. We then show that these a priori bounds hold when $A$ and $n$ are $L^\infty$ and satisfy certain monotonicity conditions, and thereby obtain new results both about the well-posedness of such problems and about the resonances of acoustic transmission problems (i.e. $A$ and $n$ discontinuous) where the transmission interfaces are only assumed to be $C^0$ and star-shaped, the novelty of this latter result is that until recently the only known results about resonances of acoustic transmission problems were for $C^\infty$ convex interfaces with strictly positive curvature.;math.AP
1801.08105;Matched asymptotics for large solutions to the Gelfand-Liouville problem in two-dimensional, doubly connected domains;In this paper we provide a formal matched asymptotic analysis for large solutions to the Gelfand-Liouville problem in planar, doubly connected domains in the plane. Using these, we rigorously construct a good approximate solution to the problem.;math.AP
1801.08109;The Hodge Star Operator and the Beltrami Equation;An essentially unique homeomorphic solution to the Beltrami equation was found in the 1960s using the theory of Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund and singular integral operators in $L^p(\mathbb C)$. We will present an alternative method to solve the Beltrami equation using the Hodge star operator and standard elliptic PDE theory. We will also discuss a different method to prove the regularity of the solution. This approach is partially based on work by Dittmar.;math.AP
1801.08111;Cluster theory of the coherent Satake category;We study the category of G(O)-equivariant perverse coherent sheaves on the affine Grassmannian of G. This coherent Satake category is not semisimple and its convolution product is not symmetric, in contrast with the usual constructible Satake category. Instead, we use the Beilinson-Drinfeld Grassmannian to construct renormalized r-matrices. These are canonical nonzero maps between convolution products which satisfy axioms weaker than those of a braiding. <br />We also show that the coherent Satake category is rigid, and that together these results strongly constrain its convolution structure. In particular, they can be used to deduce the existence of (categorified) cluster structures. We study the case G = GL_n in detail and prove that the loop rotation equivariant coherent Satake category of GL_n is a monoidal categorification of an explicit quantum cluster algebra. <br />More generally, we construct renormalized r-matrices in any monoidal category whose product is compatible with an auxiliary chiral category, and explain how the appearance of cluster algebras in 4d N=2 field theory may be understood from this point of view.;math.RT
1801.08112;Global Identifiability of Differential Models;Many real-world processes and phenomena are modeled using systems of ordinary differential equations with parameters. Given such a system, we say that a parameter is globally identifiable if it can be uniquely recovered from input and output data. The main contribution of this paper is to provide theory, an algorithm, and software for deciding global identifiability. First, we rigorously derive an algebraic criterion for global identifiability (this is an analytic property), which yields a deterministic algorithm. Second, we improve the efficiency by randomizing the algorithm while guaranteeing the probability of correctness. With our new algorithm, we can tackle problems that could not be tackled before. A software based on the algorithm (called SIAN) is available at <a href="https://github.com/pogudingleb/SIAN.">this https URL</a>;math.CA
1801.08122;Controlling an Alien Predator Population by Regional Controls;We investigate the problem of minimizing the total cost of the damages produced by an alien predator population and of the regional control paid to reduce this population. The dynamics of the predators is described by a prey-predator system with either local or nonlocal reaction terms. A sufficient condition for the zero-stabilizability (eradicability) of predators is given in terms of the sign of the principal eigenvalue of an appropriate operator that is not self-adjoint, and a stabilizing feedback control with a very simple structure is indicated. The minimization related to such a feedback control is treated for a closely related minimization problem viewed as a regional control problem. The level set method is a key ingredient. An iterative algorithm to decrease the total cost is obtained and numerical results show the effectiveness of the theoretical results. <br />A spatially structured SIR problem may be described by the same system, in this case the above mentioned minimization problem is related to the problem of eradication of an epidemic by regional controls.;math.OC
1801.08125;A Kodaira Vanishing Theorem for Noncommutative Kahler Structures;Using the framework of noncommutative Kahler structures, we generalise to the noncommutative setting the celebrated vanishing theorem of Kodaira for positive line bundles. The result is established under the assumption that the associated Dirac-Dolbeault operator of the line bundle is diagonalisable, an assumption that is shown to always hold in the quantum homogeneous space case. The general theory is then applied to the covariant Kahler structure of the Heckenberger-Kolb calculus of the quantum Grassmannians allowing us to prove a direct q-deformation of the classical Grassmannian Bott-Borel-Weil theorem for positive line bundles.;math.QA
1801.08134;On a counterexample in connection with the Picard-Lindel&#xf6,f theorem;We give an example, which demonstrates that in the situation of the Picard-Lindel\"of theorem, the Lipschitz condition on the right hand side $f(x,y)$ with respect to $y$, cannot be replaced by Lipschitz continuity in $y$ for every $x$. We show that, in our example, the classical Euler method detects only one of infinitely many solutions and we outline how the latter can be adjusted to find also other solutions numerically.;math.CA
1801.08138;Existence and concentration phenomena for a class of indefinite variational problems with critical growth;In this paper we are interested to prove the existence and concentration of ground state solution for the following class of problems $$ -\Delta u+V(x)u=A(\epsilon x)f(u), \quad x \in \R^{N}, \eqno{(P)_{\epsilon}} $$ where $N \geq 2$, $\epsilon&gt,0$, $A:\R^{N}\rightarrow\R$ is a continuous function that satisfies $$ 0&lt,\inf_{x\in\R^{N}}A(x)\leq\lim_{|x|\rightarrow+\infty}A(x)&lt,\sup_{x\in\R^{N}}A(x)=A(0),\eqno{(A)} $$ $f:\R\rightarrow\R$ is a continuous function having critical growth, $V:\R^{N}\rightarrow\R$ is a continuous and $\Z^{N}$--periodic function with $0\notin\sigma(\Delta+V)$. By using variational methods, we prove the existence of solution for $\epsilon$ small enough. After that, we show that the maximum points of the solutions concentrate around of a maximum point of $A$.;math.AP
1801.08155;FLORIS and CLORIS: Hybrid Source and Network Localization Based on Ranges and Video;We propose hybrid methods for localization in wireless sensor networks fusing noisy range measurements with angular information (extracted from video). Compared with conventional methods that rely on a single sensed variable, this may pave the way for improved localization accuracy and robustness. We address both the single-source and network (i.e., cooperative multiple-source) localization paradigms, solving them via optimization of a convex surrogate. The formulations for hybrid localization are unified in the sense that we propose a single nonlinear least-squares cost function, fusing both angular and range measurements. We then relax the problem to obtain an estimate of the optimal positions. This contrasts with other hybrid approaches that alternate the execution of localization algorithms for each type of measurement separately, to progressively refine the position estimates. Single-source localization uses a semidefinite relaxation to obtain a one-shot matrix solution from which the source position is derived via factorization. Network localization uses a different approach where sensor coordinates are retained as optimization variables, and the relaxed cost function is efficiently minimized using fast iterations based on Nesterov's optimal method. Further, an automated calibration procedure is developed to express range and angular information, obtained by different devices, possibly deployed at different locations, in a single consistent coordinate system. This drastically reduces the need for manual calibration that would otherwise negatively impact the practical usability of hybrid range/video localization systems. We develop and test, both in simulation and experimentally, the new hybrid localization algorithms, which not only overcome the limitations of previous fusing approaches but also compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods, outperforming them in some scenarios.;math.OC
1801.08158;Quasi-Toeplitz matrix arithmetic: a MATLAB toolbox;A Quasi Toeplitz (QT) matrix is a semi-infinite matrix of the kind $A=T(a)+E$ where $T(a)=(a_{j-i})_{i,j\in\mathbb Z^+}$, $E=(e_{i,j})_{i,j\in\mathbb Z^+}$ is compact and the norms $\lVert a\rVert_{\mathcal W} = \sum_{i\in\mathbb Z}|a_i|$ and $\lVert E \rVert_2$ are finite. These properties allow to approximate any QT-matrix, within any given precision, by means of a finite number of parameters. <br />QT-matrices, equipped with the norm $\lVert A \rVert_{\mathcal QT}=\alpha\lVert a\rVert_{\mathcal{W}} \lVert E \rVert_2$, for $\alpha = (1+\sqrt 5)/2$, are a Banach algebra with the standard arithmetic operations. We provide an algorithmic description of these operations on the finite parametrization of QT-matrices, and we develop a MATLAB toolbox implementing them in a transparent way. The toolbox is then extended to perform arithmetic operations on matrices of finite size that have a Toeplitz plus low-rank structure. This enables the development of algorithms for Toeplitz and quasi-Toeplitz matrices whose cost does not necessarily increase with the dimension of the problem. <br />Some examples of applications to computing matrix functions and to solving matrix equations are presented, and confirm the effectiveness of the approach.;math.NA
1801.08170;Multiple Antenna Assisted Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access;Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is potentially capable of circumventing the limitations of the classic orthogonal multiple access schemes, hence it has recently received significant research attention both in industry and academia. This article is focused on exploiting multiple antenna techniques in NOMA networks, with an emphasis on investigating the rate region of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-NOMA, whist reviewing two popular multiple antennas aided NOMA structures, as well as underlining resource management problems of both single-carrier and multi-carrier MIMO-NOMA networks. This article also points out several effective methods of tackling the practical implementation constraints of multiple antenna NOMA networks. Finally, some promising open research directions are provided in context of multiple antenna aided NOMA.;cs.IT
1801.08172;The strength of compactness in Computability Theory and Nonstandard Analysis;Compactness is one of the core notions of analysis: it connects local properties to global ones and makes limits well-behaved. We study the computational properties of the compactness of Cantor space $2^{\mathbb{N}}$ for uncountable covers. The most basic question is: how hard is it to compute a finite sub-cover from such a cover of $2^{\mathbb{N}}$? Another natural question is: how hard is it to compute a sequence that covers $2^{\mathbb{N}}$ minus a measure zero set from such a cover? The special and weak fan functionals respectively compute such finite sub-covers and sequences. In this paper, we establish the connection between these new fan functionals on one hand, and various well-known comprehension axioms on the other hand, including arithmetical comprehension, transfinite recursion, and the Suslin functional. In the spirit of Reverse Mathematics, we also analyse the logical strength of compactness in Nonstandard Analysis. Perhaps surprisingly, the results in the latter mirror (often perfectly) the computational properties of the special and weak fan functionals. In particular, we show that compactness (nonstandard or otherwise) readily brings us to the outer edges of Reverse Mathematics (namely $\Pi_2^1$-CA$_0$), and even into Schweber's higher-order framework (namely $\Sigma_{1}^{2}$-separation).;math.LO
1801.08174;Modular invariants for real quadratic fields and Kloosterman sums;We investigate the asymptotic distribution of integrals of the $j$-function that are associated to ideal classes in a real quadratic field. To estimate the error term in our asymptotic formula, we prove a bound for sums of Kloosterman sums of half-integral weight that is uniform in every parameter. To establish this estimate we prove a variant of Kuznetsov's formula where the spectral data is restricted to half-integral weight forms in the Kohnen plus space, and we apply Young's hybrid subconvexity estimates for twisted modular $L$-functions.;math.NT
1801.08177;Outage Performance of Two-Way Relay Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Systems;This paper investigates a two-way relay nonorthogonal multiple access (TWR-NOMA) system, where two groups of NOMA users exchange messages with the aid of one half-duplex (HD) decode-and-forward (DF) relay. Since the signal-plus-interference-to-noise ratios (SINRs) of NOMA signals mainly depend on effective successive interference cancellation (SIC) schemes, imperfect SIC (ipSIC) and perfect SIC (pSIC) are taken into consideration. To characterize the performance of TWR-NOMA systems, we derive closed-form expressions for both exact and asymptotic outage probabilities of NOMA users' signals with ipSIC/pSIC. Based on the results derived, the diversity order and throughput of the system are examined. Numerical simulations demonstrate that: 1) TWR-NOMA is superior to TWR-OMA in terms of outage probability in low SNR regimes, and 2) Due to the impact of interference signal (IS) at the relay, error floors and throughput ceilings exist in outage probabilities and ergodic rates for TWR-NOMA, respectively.;cs.IT
1801.08178;Restricted One-dimensional Central Extensions of the Restricted Filiform Lie Algebras ${\frak m}_0^&#x3bb,(p)$;We show, for a field ${\mathbb F}$ of prime characteristic $p&gt,0$, that the truncated filiform Lie algebra ${\frak m}_0(p)$ admits a family ${\frak m}_0^\lambda(p)$ of restricted Lie algebra structures parameterized by elements $\lambda\in {\mathbb F}^p$. We compute the ordinary cohomology groups $H^q({\frak m}_0^\lambda(p))$ and restricted cohomology groups $H^q_*({\frak m}_0^\lambda(p))$ for $q=1, 2$, and we give explicit descriptions of bases for these cohomology spaces. We apply our results to restricted one-dimensional central Extensions of the algebras ${\frak m}_0^\lambda(p)$.;math.RT
1801.08181;Outage Performance of A Unified Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Framework;In this paper, a unified framework of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks is proposed, which can be applied to code-domain NOMA (CD-NOMA) and power-domain NOMA (PD-NOMA). Since the detection of NOMA users mainly depend on efficient successive interference cancellation (SIC) schemes, both imperfect SIC (ipSIC) and perfect SIC (pSIC) are taken into considered. To characterize the performance of this unified framework, the exact and asymptotic expressions of outage probabilities as well as delay-limited throughput for CD/PD-NOMA with ipSIC/pSIC are derived. Based on the asymptotic analysis, the diversity orders of CD/PD-NOMA are provided. It is confirmed that due to the impact of residual interference (RI), the outage probability of the n-th user with ipSIC for CD/PD-NOMA converges to an error floor in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the outage behavior of CD-NOMA is superior to that of PD-NOMA.;cs.IT
1801.08194;On the maximal graded shifts of ideals and modules;We generalize a result of Eisenbud-Huneke-Ulrich on the maximal graded shifts of a module with prescribed annihilator and prove a linear regularity bound for ideals in a polynomial ring depending only on the first $p - c$ steps in the resolution, where $p = \mathrm{pd}(S/I)$ and $c = \mathrm{codim}(I)$.;math.AC
1801.08195;The projective dimension of three cubics is at most 5;Let $R$ be a polynomial ring over a field and $I$ an ideal generated by three forms of degree three. Motivated by Stillman's question, Engheta proved that the projective dimension $\mathrm{pd}(R/I)$ of $R/I$ is at most 36, although the example with largest projective dimension he constructed has $\mathrm{pd}(R/I)=5$. Based on computational evidence, it had been conjectured that $\mathrm{pd}(R/I)\leq 5$. In the present paper we prove this conjectured sharp bound.;math.AC
1801.08198;User Association and Resource Allocation in Unified NOMA Enabled Heterogeneous Ultra Dense Networks;Heterogeneous ultra dense networks (HUDNs) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) have been identified as two proposing techniques for the fifth generation (5G) mobile communication systems due to their great capabilities to enhance spectrum efficiency. This article investigates the application of NOMA techniques in HUDNs to support massive connectivity in 5G systems. Particularly, a unified NOMA framework is proposed, including power-domain NOMA and code-domain NOMA, which can be configured flexibly to serve different applications scenarios. As a further advance, the unified NOMA framework enabled HUDNs is further investigated, with particular focuses on the user association and resource allocation. Two case studies are provided for demonstrating the effectiveness of the unified NOMA enabled HUDNs. Finally, some main challenges and promising research directions in NOMA enabled HUDNs are identified.

1801.08199;On geometric estimates for some problems arising from modeling pull-in voltage in MEMS;In this paper for all $p&gt,1$ we prove that the pull-in voltage of the $p$-MEMS (micro-electro mechanical systems) problems on a smooth bounded domain of $\mathbb R^{d}, d\geq1,$ is minimized by symmetrizing the domain and the permittivity profile. The proofs rely on some suitable version of Talenti's comparison principle. We also demonstrate our method to the multidimensional MEMS type problems on the whole space $\mathbb R^{d}, d\geq3,$ and the Dirichlet boundary value problems of second order uniformly elliptic differential operators.;math.AP
1801.08203;Classification of the Discrete Real Specializations of the Burau Representation of $B_3$;This classification is found by analyzing the action of a normal subgroup of $B_3$ as hyperbolic isometries. This paper gives an example of an unfaithful specialization of the Burau representation on $B_4$ that is faithful when restricted to $B_3$, as well as examples of unfaithful specializations of $B_3$.;math.GT
1801.08206;Sparse Representation for Wireless Communications: A Compressive Sensing Approach;Sparse representation can efficiently model signals in different applications to facilitate processing. In this article, we will discuss various applications of sparse representation in wireless communications, with focus on the most recent compressive sensing (CS) enabled approaches. With the help of the sparsity property, CS is able to enhance the spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency for the fifth generation (5G) networks and Internet of Things (IoT) networks. This article starts from a comprehensive overview of CS principles and different sparse domains potentially used in 5G and IoT networks. Then recent research progress on applying CS to address the major opportunities and challenges in 5G and IoT networks is introduced, including wideband spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks, data collection in IoT networks, and channel estimation and feedback in massive MIMO systems. Moreover, other potential applications and research challenges on sparse representation for 5G and IoT networks are identified. This article will provide readers a clear picture of how to exploit the sparsity properties to process wireless signals in different applications.;cs.IT
1801.08207;Modules of infinite regularity over commutative graded rings;In this work, we prove that if a graded, commutative algebra $R$ over a field $k$ is not Koszul then, denoting by $\mathfrak{m}$ the maximal homogeneous ideal of $R$ and by $M$ a finitely generated graded $R$-module, the nonzero modules of the form $\mathfrak{m} M$ have infinite Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity. We also prove that over complete intersections which are not Koszul, a nonzero direct summand of a syzygy of $k$ has infinite regularity. Finally, we relate the vanishing of the graded deviations of $R$ to having a nonzero direct summand of a syzygy of $k$ of finite regularity.;math.AC
1801.08219;Chern classes of automorphic vector bundles, II;We prove that the $\ell$-adic Chern classes of canonical extensions of automorphic vector bundles, over toroidal compactifications of Shimura varieties of Hodge type over $\bar{ \mathbb{Q}}_p$, descend to classes in the $\ell$-adic cohomology of the minimal compactifications. These are invariant under the Galois group of the $p$-adic field above which the variety and the bundle are defined.;math.AG
1801.08223;Reciprocal lower bound on modulus of curve families in metric surfaces;We prove that any metric space $X$ homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2$ with locally finite Hausdorff 2-measure satisfies a reciprocal lower bound on modulus of curve families associated to a quadrilateral. More precisely, let $Q \subset X$ be a topological quadrilateral with boundary edges (in cyclic order) denoted by $\zeta_1, \zeta_2, \zeta_3, \zeta_4$ and let $\Gamma(\zeta_i, \zeta_j, Q)$ denote the family of curves in $Q$ connecting $\zeta_i$ and $\zeta_j$, then $\text{mod} \Gamma(\zeta_1, \zeta_3, Q) \text{mod} \Gamma(\zeta_2, \zeta_4, Q) \geq 1/\kappa$ for $\kappa = 2000^2\cdot (4/\pi)^2$. This answers a question concerning minimal hypotheses under which a metric space admits a quasiconformal parametrization by a domain in $\mathbb{R}^2$.;math.MG
1801.08229;Singular semipositive metrics on line bundles on varieties over trivially valued fields;Let X be a smooth projective Berkovich space over a trivially or discretely valued field k of residue characteristic zero, and let L be an ample line bundle on X. We develop a theory of plurisubharmonic (or semipositive) metrics on L. In particular we show that the (non-Archimedean) Monge-Amp\`ere operator induces a bijection between plurisubharmonic metrics and Radon probability measures of finite energy. In the discretely valued case, these results refine earlier work obtained in collaboration with C.Favre. In the trivially valued case, the results are new and will in subsequent work be shown to have ramifications for the study of K-stability.;math.AG
1801.08231;Stirling Posets;We define combinatorially a partial order on the set partitions and show that it is equivalent to the Bruhat-Chevalley-Renner order on the upper triangular matrices. By considering subposets consisting of set partitions with a fixed number of blocks, we introduce and investigate "Stirling posets." As we show, the Stirling posets have a hierarchy and they glue together to give the whole set partition poset. Moreover, we show that they (Stirling posets) are graded and EL-shellable. We offer various reformulations of their length functions and determine the recurrences for their length generating series.;math.CO
1801.08232;Singular solutions of linear problems with fractional Laplacian;In this paper, we study singular solutions of linear problems with fractional Laplacian. First, we establish B\^ocher type theorems on a punctured ball via distributional approach. Then, we develop a few interesting maximum principles on a punctured ball. Our distributional approach only requires the basic local L-1 integrability. We also introduce several simple and useful lemmas, which enable us to unify the treatments for both Laplacian and fractional Laplacian. These theorems, lemmas and the methods introduced here can be adapted and applied in other situations.;math.AP
1801.08239;Geometric finiteness in negatively pinched Hadamard manifolds;In this paper, we generalize Bonahon's characterization of geometrically infinite torsion-free discrete subgroups of PSL(2, $\mathbb{C}$) to geometrically infinite discrete subgroups $\Gamma$ of isometries of negatively pinched Hadamard manifolds $X$. We then generalize a theorem of Bishop to prove that every discrete geometrically infinite isometry subgroup $\Gamma$ has a set of nonconical limit points with the cardinality of the continuum.;math.GR
1801.08243;Vector Coloring the Categorical Product of Graphs;A vector $t$-coloring of a graph is an assignment of real vectors $p_1, \ldots, p_n$ to its vertices such that $p_i^Tp_i = t-1$ for all $i=1, \ldots, n$ and $p_i^Tp_j \le -1$ whenever $i$ and $j$ are adjacent. The vector chromatic number of $G$ is the smallest real number $t \ge 1$ for which a vector $t$-coloring of $G$ exists. For a graph $H$ and a vector $t$-coloring $p_1,\ldots,p_n$ of a graph $G$, the assignment $(i,\ell) \mapsto p_i$ is a vector $t$-coloring of the categorical product $G \times H$. It follows that the vector chromatic number of $G \times H$ is at most the minimum of the vector chromatic numbers of the factors. We prove that equality always holds, constituting a vector coloring analog of the famous Hedetniemi Conjecture from graph coloring. Furthermore, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for when all of the optimal vector colorings of the product can be expressed in terms of the optimal vector colorings of the factors. The vector chromatic number is closely related to the well-known Lov\'{a}sz theta function, and both of these parameters admit formulations as semidefinite programs. This connection to semidefinite programming is crucial to our work and the tools and techniques we develop could likely be of interest to others in this field.;math.CO
1801.08249;Highly linked tournaments with large minimum out-degree;We prove that there exists a function $f:\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ such that for any positive integer $k$, if $T$ is a strongly $4k$-connected tournament with minimum out-degree at least $f(k)$, then $T$ is $k$-linked. This makes progress towards resolving a conjecture of Pokrovskiy. Along the way, we show that a tournament with sufficiently large minimum out-degree contains a subdivision of a complete directed graph. This result may be of independent interest.;math.CO
1801.08250;Existence of self-similar solution of the inverse mean curvature flow;We will give a new proof of a recent result of P.~Daskalopoulos, G.Huisken and J.R.King ([DH] and reference [7] of [DH]) on the existence of self-similar solution of the inverse mean curvature flow which is the graph of a radially symmetric solution in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\ge 2$, of the form $u(x,t)=e^{\lambda t}f(e^{-\lambda t} x)$ for any constants $\lambda&gt,\frac{1}{n-1}$ and $\mu&lt,0$ such that $f(0)=\mu$. More precisely we will give a new proof of the existence of a unique radially symmetric solution $f$ of the equation $\mbox{div}\,\left(\frac{\nabla f}{\sqrt{1+|\nabla f|^2}} \right)=\frac{1}{\lambda}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{1+|\nabla f|^2}}{x\cdot\nabla f-f}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $f(0)=\mu$, for any $\lambda&gt,\frac{1}{n-1}$ and $\mu&lt,0$, which satisfies $f_r(r)&gt,0$, $f_{rr}(r)&gt,0$ and $rf_r(r)&gt,f(r)$ for all $r&gt,0$. We will also prove that $\lim_{r\to\infty}\frac{rf_r(r)}{f(r)}=\frac{\lambda (n-1)}{\lambda (n-1)-1}$.;math.AP
1801.08260;Galois theory for general systems of polynomial equations;We prove that the monodromy group of a reduced irreducible square system of general polynomial equations equals the symmetric group. This is a natural first step towards the Galois theory of general systems of polynomial equations, because arbitrary systems split into reduced irreducible ones upon monomial changes of variables. <br />In particular, our result proves the multivariate version of the Abel--Ruffini theorem: the classification of general systems of equations solvable by radicals reduces to the classification of lattice polytopes of mixed volume 4 (which we prove to be finite in every dimension). We also notice that the monodromy of every general system of equations is either symmetric or imprimitive, similarly to what Sottile and White conjectured in Schubert calculus. <br />The proof is based on a new result of independent importance regarding dual defectiveness of systems of equations: the discriminant of a reduced irreducible square system of general polynomial equations is a hypersurface unless the system is linear up to a monomial change of variables.;math.AG
1801.08261;Jacobian rings for homogenous vector bundles and applications;In this note, we examine the Jacobian ring description of the Hodge structure of zero loci of vector bundle sections on a class of ambient varieties. We consider a set of cohomological vanishing conditions that imply such a description, and we verify these conditions for some new cases. We also observe that the method can be directly extended to log homogeneous varieties. We apply the Jacobian ring to study the null varieties of period integrals and their derivatives, generalizing a result in [9] for projective spaces. As an additional application, we prove the Hodge conjecture for very generic hypersurfaces in certain generalized flag varieties.;math.AG
1801.08262;Wilf equivalence relations for consecutive patterns;Two permutations $\pi$ and $\tau$ are c-Wilf equivalent if, for each $n$, the number of permutations in $S_n$ avoiding $\pi$ as a consecutive pattern (i.e., in adjacent positions) is the same as the number of those avoiding $\tau$. In addition, $\pi$ and $\tau$ are strongly c-Wilf equivalent if, for each $n$ and $k$, the number of permutations in $S_n$ containing $k$ occurrences of $\pi$ as a consecutive pattern is the same as for $\tau$. In this paper we introduce a third, more restrictive equivalence relation, defining $\pi$ and $\tau$ to be super-strongly c-Wilf equivalent if the above condition holds for any set of prescribed positions for the $k$ occurrences. We show that, when restricted to non-overlapping permutations, these three equivalence relations coincide. <br />We also give a necessary condition for two permutations to be strongly c-Wilf equivalent. Specifically, we show that if $\pi,\tau$ in $S_m$ are strongly c-Wilf equivalent, then $|\pi_m-\pi_1|=|\tau_m-\tau_1|$. In the special case of non-overlapping permutations $\pi$ and $\tau$, this proves a weaker version of a conjecture of the second author stating that $\pi$ and $\tau$ are c-Wilf equivalent if and only if $\pi_1=\tau_1$ and $\pi_m=\tau_m$, up to trivial symmetries. Finally, we strengthen a recent result of Nakamura and Khoroshkin-Shapiro giving sufficient conditions for strong c-Wilf equivalence.;math.CO
1801.08266;Stochastic Successive Convex Approximation for Non-Convex Constrained Stochastic Optimization;This paper proposes a constrained stochastic successive convex approximation (CSSCA) algorithm to find a stationary point for a general non-convex stochastic optimization problem, whose objective and constraint functions are non-convex and involve expectations over random states. Most existing methods for non-convex stochastic optimization, such as the stochastic (average) gradient and stochastic majorization-minimization, only consider minimizing a stochastic non-convex objective over a deterministic convex set. The proposed CSSCA algorithm can also handle stochastic non-convex constraints in optimization problems, and it opens the way to solving more challenging optimization problems that occur in many applications. The algorithm is based on solving a sequence of convex objective/feasibility optimization problems obtained by replacing the objective/constraint functions in the original problems with some convex surrogate functions. The CSSCA algorithm allows a wide class of surrogate functions and thus provides many freedoms to design good surrogate functions for specific applications. Moreover, it also facilitates parallel implementation for solving large scale stochastic optimization problems, which arise naturally in today's signal processing such as machine learning and big data analysis. We establish the convergence of CSSCA algorithm with a feasible initial point, and customize the algorithmic framework to solve several important application problems. Simulations show that the CSSCA algorithm can achieve superior performance over existing solutions.;cs.IT
1801.08270;Analysis and Design of Serially Concatenated LDGM Codes;In this paper, we first present the asymptotic performance of serially concatenated low-density generator-matrix (SCLDGM) codes for binary input additive white Gaussian noise channels using discretized density evolution (DDE). We then provide a necessary condition for the successful decoding of these codes. The error-floor analysis along with the lower bound formulas for both LDGM and SCLDGM codes are also provided and verified. We further show that by concatenating inner LDGM codes with a high-rate outer LDPC code instead of concatenating two LDGM codes as in SCLDGM codes, good codes without error floors can be constructed. Finally, with an efficient DDE-based optimization approach that utilizes the necessary condition for the successful decoding, we construct optimized SCLDGM codes that approach the Shannon limit. The improved performance of our optimized SCLDGM codes is demonstrated through both asymptotic and simulation results.;cs.IT
1801.08272;Seven combinatorial problems around quasihomogeneous singularities;This paper proposes seven combinatorial problems around formulas for the characteristic polynomial and the spectral numbers of a quasihomogeneous singularity. One of them is a new conjecture on the characteristic polynomial. It is an amendment to an old conjecture of Orlik on the integral monodromy of a quasihomogeneous singularity. The search for a combinatorial proof of the new conjecture led us to the seven purely combinatorial problems.;math.CO
1801.08274;Stochastic Successive Convex Optimization for Two-timescale Hybrid Precoding in Massive MIMO;Hybrid precoding, which consists of an RF precoder and a baseband precoder, is a popular precoding architecture for massive MIMO due to its low hardware cost and power consumption. In conventional hybrid precoding, both RF and baseband precoders are adaptive to the real-time channel state information (CSI). As a result, an individual RF precoder is required for each subcarrier in wideband systems, leading to high implementation cost. To overcome this issue, two-timescale hybrid precoding (THP), which adapts the RF precoder to the channel statistics, has been proposed. Since the channel statistics are approximately the same over different subcarriers, only a single RF precoder is required in THP. Despite the advantages of THP, there lacks a unified and efficient algorithm for its optimization due to the non-convex and stochastic nature of the problem. Based on stochastic successive convex approximation (SSCA), we propose an online algorithmic framework called SSCA-THP for general THP optimization problems, in which the hybrid precoder is updated by solving a quadratic surrogate optimization problem whenever a new channel sample is obtained. Then we prove the convergence of SSCA-THP to stationary points. Finally, we apply SSCA-THP to solve three important THP optimization problems and verify its advantages over existing solutions.;cs.IT
1801.08276;Timing Advance Estimation and Beamforming of Random Access Response in Crowded TDD Massive MIMO Systems;Timing advance (TA) estimation at the base station (BS) and reliable decoding of random access response (RAR) at the users are the most important steps in the initial random access (RA) procedure. However, due to the limited availability of physical resources dedicated for RA, successful completion of RA requests would become increasingly difficult in high user density scenarios, due to contention among users requesting RA. In this paper, we propose to use the large antenna array at the massive MIMO BS to jointly group RA requests from different users using the same RA preamble. We then beamform the common RAR of each detected user group onto the same frequency resource, in such a way that most users in the group can reliably decode the RAR. The proposed RAR beamforming therefore automatically resolves the problem of collision between multiple RA requests on the same RA preamble, which reduces the RA latency significantly as compared to LTE. Analysis and simulations also reveal that for a fixed desired SINR of the received RAR, both the required per-user RA preamble transmission power and the total RAR beamforming power can be decreased roughly by 1.5 dB with every doubling in the number of BS antennas.;cs.IT
1801.08278;Analogs of Steiner&#x27,s porism and Soddy&#x27,s hexlet in higher dimensions via spherical codes;In this paper we consider generalizations of classical results on chains of tangent spheres to higher dimensions.;math.MG
1801.08279;Weighted composition operators between Fock spaces in several variables;We obtain criteria for the boundedness and compactness of weighted composition operators between different Fock spaces in $\mathbb{C}^n$. We also give estimates for essential norm of these operators.;math.CV
1801.08283;Global existence of weak solutions for Navier-Stokes-BGK system;In this paper, we study the global well-posedness of a coupled system of kinetic and fluid equations. More precisely, we establish the global existence of weak solutions for Navier-Stokes-BGK system consisting of the BGK model of Boltzmann equation and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled through a drag forcing term. This is achieved by combining weak compactness of the particle interaction operator based on Dunford-Pettis theorem, strong compactness of macroscopic fields of the kinetic part relied on velocity averaging lemma and a high order moment estimate, and strong compactness of the fluid part by Aubin-Lions lemma.;math.AP
1801.08285;Smoothing Algorithms for Computing the Projection onto a Minkowski Sum of Convex Sets;In this paper, the problem of computing the projection, and therefore the minimum distance, from a point onto a Minkowski sum of general convex sets is studied. Our approach is based on the minimum norm duality theorem originally stated by Nirenberg and the Nesterov smoothing techniques. It is shown that projection points onto a Minkowski sum of sets can be represented as the sum of points on constituent sets so that, at these points, all of the sets share the same normal vector which is the negative of the dual solution. The proposed NESMINO algorithm improves the theoretical bound on number of iterations from $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ by Gilbert [SIAM J. Contr., vol. 4, pp. 61--80, 1966] to $O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon}}\ln(\frac{1}{\epsilon})\right)$, where $\epsilon$ is the desired accuracy for the objective function. Moreover, the algorithm also provides points on each component sets such that their sum is equal to the projection point.;math.OC
1801.08286;Perverse schobers and birational geometry;Perverse schobers are conjectural categorical analogs of perverse sheaves. We show that such structures appear naturally in Homological Minimal Model Program which studies the effect of birational transformations such as flops, on the coherent derived categories. More precisely, the flop data are analogous to hyperbolic stalks of a perverse sheaf. <br />In the first part of the paper we study schober-type diagrams of categories corresponding to flops of relative dimension 1, in particular we determine the categorical analogs of the (compactly supported) cohomology with coefficients in such schobers. <br />In the second part we consider the example of a "web of flops" provided by the Grothendieck resolution associated to a reductive Lie algebra g and study the corresponding schober-type diagram. For g=sl(3) we relate this diagram to the classical space of complete triangles studied by Schubert, Semple and others.;math.AG
1801.08288;The volume and Chern-Simons invariant of a Dehn-filled manifold;For a compact 3-manifold $N$ with non-empty boundary, Zickert gave a combinatorial formula for computing the volume and Chern-Simons invariant of a boundary parabolic representation $\pi_1(N)\rightarrow \mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})$. In this paper, we introduce a notion of deformed Ptolemy varieties and extend the formula of Zickert to a representation that is not necessarily boundary parabolic. This allows us to compute the volume and Chern-Simons invariant of a $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})$-representation of a closed 3-manifold.;math.GT
1801.08294;Optimum Fairness for Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access;This paper focuses on the fairness issue in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and investigates the optimization problem that maximizes the worst user's achievable rate. Unlike previous studies, we derive a closed-form expression for the optimal value and solution, which are related to Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue and eigenvector of a defined positive matrix. On this basis, we propose an iterative algorithm to compute the optimal solution, which has linear convergence and requires only about half iterations of the classical bisection method.;cs.IT
1801.08302;Weighted boundedness of the 2-fold product of Hardy-Littlewood maximal operators;We study new weighted estimates for the 2-fold product of Hardy-Littlewood maximal operators defined by $M^{\otimes}(f,g):= MfMg$. This operator appears very naturally in the theory of bilinear operators such as the bilinear Calder\'on-Zygmund operators, the bilinear Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator introduced by Calder\'on or in the study of pseudodifferential operators. To this end, we need to study H\"older's inequality for Lorentz spaces with change of measures $$ <br />\Vert fg \Vert_{L^{p,\infty}\left(w_1^{p/p_1} w_2^{p/p_2}\right)} \le C \Vert f \Vert_{L^{p_1,\infty}(w_1 )} \Vert g \Vert_{L^{p_2,\infty}(w_2 )}. $$ Unfortunately, we shall prove that this inequality does not hold, in general, and we shall have to consider a weaker version of it.;math.FA
1801.08303;Stability of nonnegative isotropic curvature under continuous deformations of the metric;Using a method introduced by R. Bamler to study the behavior of scalar curvature under continuous deformations of Riemannian metrics, we prove that if a sequence of smooth Riemannian metrics gi on a fixed compact manifold M has isotropic curvature bounded from below by a nonnegative function u, and if gi converge in C 0 norm to a smooth metric g, then g has isotropic curvature bounded from below by u. The proof also works for various other bounds from below on the curvature, such has non-negative curvature operator.;math.DG
1801.08304;Smilansky-Solomyak model with a $&#x3b4,&#x27,$-interaction;We investigate a strongly singular version of the model of irreversible dynamics proposed by Smilansky and Solomyak in which the interaction responsible for an abrupt change of the spectrum is of $\delta'$ type. We determine the spectrum in both the subcritical and supercritical regimes and discuss its character as well as its asymptotic properties of the discrete spectrum in terms of the coupling constant.;math-ph
1801.08306;Affine surfaces which are K&#xe4,hler, para-K&#xe4,hler, or nilpotent K&#xe4,hler;Motivated by the construction of Bach flat neutral signature Riemannian extensions, we study the space of parallel trace free tensors of type $(1,1)$ on an affine surface. It is shown that the existence of such a parallel tensor field is characterized by the recurrence of the symmetric part of the Ricci tensor.;math.DG
1801.08307;Two types of Lie Groups as 4-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with circulant structure;A 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold equipped with an endomorphism of the tangent bundle, whose fourth power is the identity, is considered. The matrix of this structure in some basis is circulant and the structure acts as an isometry with respect to the metric. Such manifolds are constructed on 4-dimensional real Lie groups with Lie algebras of two remarkable types. Some of their geometric characteristics are obtained.;math.DG
1801.08308;Uniqueness of mass-conserving self-similar solutions to Smoluchowski&#x27,s coagulation equation with inverse power law kernels;Uniqueness of mass-conserving self-similar solutions to Smoluchowski's coagulation equation is shown when the coagulation kernel $K$ is given by $K(x,x\_*)=2(x x\_*)^{-\alpha}$, $(x,x\_*)\in (0,\infty)^2$, for some $\alpha&gt,0$.;math.AP
1801.08309;The orthonormal Strichartz inequality on torus;In this paper, motivated by recent important works due to Frank-Lewin-Lieb-Seiringer \cite{FLLS} and Frank-Sabin \cite{frank-sabin-1}, we study the Strichartz inequality on torus with the orthonormal system input and obtain sharp estimates in certain sense. An application of the inequality shows the well-posedness to the periodic Hartree equation describing the infinitely many quantum particles with the power type interaction.;math.FA
1801.08311;On complex and real identifiability of tensors;We report about the state of the art on complex and real generic identifiability of tensors, we describe some of our recent results obtained in [6] and we present perspectives on the subject.;math.AG
1801.08312;Weak compactness techniques and coagulation equations;Smoluchowski's coagulation equation is a mean-field model describing the growth of clusters by successive mergers. Since its derivation in 1916 it has been studied by several authors, using deterministic and stochastic approaches, with a blossoming of results in the last twenty years. In particular, the use of weak $L^1$-compactness techniques led to a mature theory of weak solutions and the purpose of these notes is to describe the results obtained so far in that direction, as well as the mathematical tools used.;math.AP
1801.08313;Alcove random walks, k-Schur functions and the minimal boundary of the k-bounded partition poset;We use k-Schur functions to get the minimal boundary of the k-bounded partition poset. This permits to describe the central random walks on affine Grassmannian elements of type A and yields a polynomial expression for their drift. We also recover Rietsch's parametriza-tion of totally nonnegative unitriangular Toeplitz matrices without using quantum cohomology of flag varieties. All the homeomorphisms we define can moreover be made explicit by using the combinatorics of k-Schur functions and elementary computations based on Perron-Frobenius theorem.;math.CO
1801.08315;Applications of self-distributivity to Yang-Baxter operators and their cohomology;Self-distributive (SD) structures form an important class of solutions to the Yang--Baxter equation, which underlie spectacular knot-theoretic applications of self-distributivity. It is less known that one go the other way round, and construct an SD structure out of any left non-degenerate (LND) set-theoretic YBE solution. This structure captures important properties of the solution: invertibility, involutivity, biquandle-ness, the associated braid group actions. Surprisingly, the tools used to study these associated SD structures also apply to the cohomology of LND solutions, which generalizes SD cohomology. Namely, they yield an explicit isomorphism between two cohomology theories for these solutions, which until recently were studied independently. The whole story leaves numerous open questions. One of them is the relation between the cohomologies of a YBE solution and its associated SD structure. These and related questions are covered in the present survey.;math.AT
1801.08325;New relatives of the Sierpinski gasket;By slight modification of the data of the Sierpinski gasket, keeping the open set condition fulfilled, we obtain self-similar sets with very dense parts, similar to fractals in nature and in random models. This is caused by a complicated structure of the open set and is revealed only under magnification. Thus the family of self-similar sets with separation condition is much richer and has higher modelling potential than usually expected. An interactive computer search for such examples and new properties for their classification are discussed.;math.DS
1801.08326;Geometric properties of Dirichlet forms under order isomorphisms;We study pairs of Dirichlet forms related by an intertwining order isomorphisms between the associated $L^2$-spaces. We consider the measurable, the topological and the geometric setting respectively. In the measurable setting, we deal with arbitrary (irreducible) Dirichlet forms and show that any intertwining order isomorphism is necessarily unitary (up to a constant). In the topological setting we deal with quasi-regular forms and show that any intertwining order isomorphism induces a quasi-homeomorphism between the underlying spaces. In the geometric setting we deal with both regular Dirichlet forms as well as resistance forms and essentially show that the geometry defined by these forms is preserved by intertwining order isomorphisms. In particular, we prove in the strongly local regular case that intertwining order isomorphisms induce isometries with respect to the intrinsic metrics between the underlying spaces under fairly mild assumptions. This applies to a wide variety of metric measure spaces including $\mathrm{RCD}(K,N)$-spaces, complete weighted Riemannian manifolds and complete quantum graphs. In the non-local regular case our results cover in particular graphs as well as fractional Laplacians as arising in the treatment of $\alpha$-stable L\'evy processes. For resistance forms we show that intertwining order isomorphisms are isometries with respect to the resistance metrics. <br />Our results can can be understood as saying that diffusion always determines the Hilbert space, and -- under natural compatibility assumptions -- the topology and the geometry respectively. As special instances they cover earlier results for manifolds and graphs.;math.FA
1801.08327;On Behaviors of Maximal Dimension;In this paper, we investigate behaviors of Maximal Dimension, a group invariant involving certain configuration of maximal subgroups, which we denote by MaxDim. We prove that in some special cases, MaxDim(G\times H) = MaxDim(G) + MaxDim(H). We also prove a conjecture stated by Ellie Thieu which shows that groups with m &lt, MaxDim can be constructed from groups with m &lt, i.;math.GR
1801.08333;Quasi-pullback of Borcherds products;Quasi-pullback of Borcherds products is an operation of renormalized restriction. It produces a meromorphic modular form on a lower dimensional symmetric domain which is again a Borcherds product. We give an explicit formula for the weakly holomorphic modular form of Weil representation type whose Borcherds lift is the quasi-pullback of the given Borcherds product.;math.NT
1801.08335;Arc-smooth functions on closed sets;By an influential theorem of Boman, a function $f$ on an open set $U$ in $\mathbb R^d$ is smooth ($\mathcal C^\infty$) if and only if it is arc-smooth, i.e., $f\circ c$ is smooth for every smooth curve $c : \mathbb R \to U$. In this paper we investigate the validity of this result on closed sets. Our main focus is on sets which are the closure of their interior, so-called fat sets. We obtain an analogue of Boman's theorem on fat closed sets with H\"older boundary and on fat closed subanalytic sets with the property that every boundary point has a basis of neighborhoods each of which intersects the interior in a connected set. If $X \subseteq \mathbb R^d$ is any such set and $f : X \to \mathbb R$ is arc-smooth, then $f$ extends to a smooth function defined on $\mathbb R^d$. We also get a version of the Bochnak-Siciak theorem on all closed fat subanalytic and all closed sets with H\"older boundary: if $f : X \to \mathbb R$ is the restriction of a smooth function on $\mathbb R^d$ which is real analytic along all real analytic curves in $X$, then $f$ extends to a holomorphic function on a neighborhood of $X$ in $\mathbb C^d$. Similar results hold for non-quasianalytic Denjoy-Carleman classes (of Roumieu type). We will also discuss sharpness and applications of these results.;math.CA
1801.08339;Surface theory in discrete projective differential geometry. I. A canonical frame and an integrable discrete Demoulin system;We present the first steps of a procedure which discretises surface theory in classical projective differential geometry in such a manner that underlying integrable structure is preserved. We propose a canonical frame in terms of which the associated projective Gauss-Weingarten and Gauss-Mainardi-Codazzi equations adopt compact forms. Based on a scaling symmetry which injects a parameter into the linear Gauss-Weingarten equations, we set down an algebraic classification scheme of discrete projective minimal surfaces which turns out to admit a geometric counterpart formulated in terms of discrete notions of Lie quadrics and their envelopes. In the case of discrete Demoulin surfaces, we derive a Backlund transformation for the underlying discrete Demoulin system and show how the latter may be formulated as a two-component generalisation of the integrable discrete Tzitzeica equation which has originally been derived in a different context. At the geometric level, this connection leads to the retrieval of the standard discretisation of affine spheres in affine differential geometry.;math.DG
1801.08342;On the approximation of weakly plurifinely plurisubharmonic functions;In this note, we study the approximation of singular plurifinely plurisubharmonic function $u$ defined on a plurifinely domain $\Omega$. Under some conditions, we prove that $u$ can be approximated by an increasing sequence of plurisubharmonic functions defined on Euclidean neighborhoods of $\Omega$.;math.CV
1801.08343;A note on fractional powers of the Hermite operator;We give a very short proof of a result proved by Cappiello-Rodino-Toft on the Weyl symbol of the inverse of the Harmonic oscillator. We also extend their results to fractional powers.;math.AP
1801.08345;Existence of connected regular and nearly regular graphs;For integers $k \geq 2$ and $n \geq k+1$, we prove the following: If $n\cdot k$ is even, there is a connected $k$-regular graph on $n$ vertices. If $n\cdot k$ is odd, there is a connected nearly $k$-regular graph on $n$ vertices.;math.CO
1801.08348;The convergence of boundary expansions and the analyticity of minimal surfaces in the hyperbolic space;We study expansions near the boundary of solutions to the Dirichlet problem for minimal graphs in the hyperbolic space and prove the local convergence of such expansions if the boundary is locally analytic. As a consequence, we prove a conjecture by F.-H. Lin that the minimal graph is analytic up to the boundary if the boundary is analytic and the minimal graph is smooth up to the boundary.;math.AP
1801.08352;Numerical investigation on the fixed-stress splitting scheme for Biot&#x27,s equations: Optimality of the tuning parameter;We study the numerical solution of the quasi-static linear Biot's equations solved iteratively by the fixed-stress splitting scheme. In each iteration the mechanical and flow problems are decoupled, where the flow problem is solved by keeping an artificial mean stress fixed. This introduces a numerical tuning parameter which can be optimized. We investigate numerically the optimality of the parameter and compare our results with physically and mathematically motivated values from the literature, which commonly only depend on mechanical material parameters. We demonstrate, that the optimal value of the tuning parameter is also affected by the boundary conditions and material parameters associated to the fluid flow problem suggesting the need for the integration of those in further mathematical analyses optimizing the tuning parameter.;math.NA
1801.08356;Constant Slope Models and Perturbation;We sharpen an estimate for the growth rate of preimages of a point under a transitive piecewise monotone interval map. Then we apply our estimate to study the continuity of the operator which assigns to such a map its constant slope model.;math.DS
1801.08364;Model selection and local geometry;We consider problems in model selection caused by the geometry of models close to their points of intersection. In some cases---including common classes of causal or graphical models, as well as time series models---distinct models may nevertheless have identical tangent spaces. This has two immediate consequences: first, in order to obtain constant power to reject one model in favour of another we need local alternative hypotheses that decrease to the null at a slower rate than the usual parametric $n^{-1/2}$ (typically we will require $n^{-1/4}$ or slower), in other words, to distinguish between the models we need large effect sizes or very large sample sizes. Second, we show that under even weaker conditions on their tangent cones, models in these classes cannot be made simultaneously convex by a reparameterization. <br />This shows that Bayesian network models, amongst others, cannot be learned directly with a convex method similar to the graphical lasso. However, we are able to use our results to suggest methods for model selection that learn the tangent space directly, rather than the model itself. In particular, we give a generic algorithm for learning Bayesian network models.;math.ST
1801.08370;On the abundance of silting modules;Silting modules are abundant. Indeed, they parametrise the definable torsion classes over a noetherian ring, and the hereditary torsion pairs of finite type over a commutative ring. Also the universal localisations of a hereditary ring, or of a finite dimensional algebra of finite representation type, can be parametrised by silting modules. In these notes, we give a brief introduction to the fairly recent concepts of silting and cosilting module, and we explain the classification results mentioned above.;math.RT
1801.08374;Maximal subgroups of ${}^2E_6(2)$ and its automorphism groups;We give a new computer-assisted proof of the classification of maximal subgroups of the simple group ${}^2E_6(2)$ and its extensions by any subgroup of the outer automorphism group $S_3$. This is not a new result, but no earlier proof exists in the literature. A large part of the proof consists of a computational analysis of subgroups generated by an element of order 2 and an element of order 3. This method can be effectively automated, and via statistical analysis also provides a sanity check on results that may have been obtained by delicate theoretical arguments.;math.GR
1801.08376;Persistent Betti numbers of random &#x10c,ech complexes;We study the persistent homology of random \v{C}ech complexes. Generalizing a method of Penrose for studying random geometric graphs, we first describe an appropriate theoretical framework in which we can state and address our main questions. Then we define the kth persistent Betti number of a random \v{C}ech complex and determine its asymptotic order in the subcritical regime. This extends a result of Kahle on the asymptotic order of the ordinary kth Betti number of such complexes to the persistent setting.;math.AT
1801.08378;On the local integrability condition for generalised translation-invariant systems;This paper considers the local integrability condition for generalised translation-invariant systems and its relation to the Calder\'on integrability condition, the temperateness condition and the uniform counting estimate. It is shown that sufficient and necessary conditions for satisfying the local integrability condition are closely related to lower and upper bounds on the number of lattice points that intersect with the translates of a compact set. The results are complemented by examples that illustrate the crucial interplay between the translation subgroups and the generating functions of the system.;math.FA
1801.08380;Hardness of Approximation for Morse Matching;Discrete Morse theory has emerged as a powerful tool for a wide range of problems, including the computation of (persistent) homology. In this context, discrete Morse theory is used to reduce the problem of computing a topological invariant of an input simplicial complex to computing the same topological invariant of a (significantly smaller) collapsed cell or chain complex. Consequently, devising methods for obtaining gradient vector fields on complexes to reduce the size of the problem instance has become an emerging theme over the last decade. While computing the optimal gradient vector field on a simplicial complex is NP-hard, several heuristics have been observed to compute near-optimal gradient vector fields on a wide variety of datasets. Understanding the theoretical limits of these strategies is therefore a fundamental problem in computational topology. In this paper, we consider the approximability of maximization and minimization variants of the Morse matching problem, posed as open problems by Joswig and Pfetsch. We establish hardness results for Max-Morse matching and Min-Morse matching. In particular, we show that, for a simplicial complex with n simplices and dimension $d \leq 3$, it is NP-hard to approximate Min-Morse matching within a factor of $O(n^{1-\epsilon})$, for any $\epsilon &gt, 0$. Moreover, using an L-reduction from Degree 3 Max-Acyclic Subgraph to Max-Morse matching, we show that it is both NP-hard and UGC-hard to approximate Max-Morse matching for simplicial complexes of dimension $d \leq 2$ within certain explicit constant factors.;math.AT
1801.08381;Stability and Invariant Random Subgroups;Consider $\operatorname{Sym}(n)$, endowed with the normalized Hamming metric $d_n$. A finitely-generated group $\Gamma$ is \emph{P-stable} if every almost homomorphism $\rho_{n_k}\colon \Gamma\rightarrow\operatorname{Sym}(n_k)$ (i.e., for every $g,h\in\Gamma$, $\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}d_{n_k}( \rho_{n_k}(gh),\rho_{n_k}(g)\rho_{n_k}(h))=0$) is close to an actual homomorphism $\varphi_{n_k} \colon\Gamma\rightarrow\operatorname{Sym}(n_k)$. Glebsky and Rivera observed that finite groups are P-stable, while Arzhantseva and P\u{a}unescu showed the same for abelian groups and raised many questions, especially about P-stability of amenable groups. We develop P-stability in general, and in particular for amenable groups. Our main tool is the theory of invariant random subgroups (IRS), which enables us to give a characterization of P-stability among amenable groups, and to deduce stability and instability of various families of amenable groups.;math.GR
1801.08382;Stationary solutions to the boundary value problem for relativistic BGK model in a slab;In this paper, we are concerned with the boundary value problem in a slab for the stationary relativistic BGK model of Marle type, which is a relaxation model of the relativistic Boltzmann equation. In the case of fixed inflow boundary conditions, we establish the existence of unique stationary solutions.;math.AP
1801.08386;Conserved energies for the one dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation;We prove the global-in-time well-posedness of the one dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the energy space, which is a complete metric space equipped with a newly introduced metric and with the energy norm describing the $H^s$ regularities of the solutions. We establish a family of conserved energies for the one dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation, such that the energy norms of the solutions are conserved globally in time. This family of energies is also conserved by the complex modified Korteweg-de Vries flow.;math.AP
1801.08397;On the extraction of the boundary conditions and the boundary ports in second-order field theories;In this paper we consider second-order field theories in a variational setting. From the variational principle the Euler-Lagrange equations follow in an unambiguous way, but it is well known that this is not true for the Cartan form. This has also consequences on the derivation of the boundary conditions when non trivial variations are allowed on the boundary. By posing extra conditions on the set of possible boundary terms we exploit the degree of freedom in the Cartan form to extract physical meaningful boundary expressions. The same mathematical machinery will be applied to derive the boundary ports in a Hamiltonian representation of the partial differential equations which is crucial for energy based control approaches. Our results will be visualized for mechanical systems such as beam and plate models.;math.OC
1801.08400;Generation of semigroup for symmetric matrix Schr&#xf6,dinger operators in $L^p$-spaces;In this paper we establish generation of analytic strongly continuous semigroup in $L^p$--spaces for the symmetric matrix Schr\"odinger operator $div(Q\nabla u)-Vu$, where, for every $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$, $V(x)=(v_{ij}(x))$ is a semi-definite positive and symmetric matrix. The diffusion matrix $Q(\cdot)$ is supposed to be strongly elliptic and bounded and the potential $V$ satisfies the weak condition $v_{ij}\in L^1_{loc}(\mathbb{R}^d)$, for all $i,j\in\{1,\dots,m\}$. We also characterize positivity of the semigroup and we investigate on its compactness.;math.AP
1801.08407;Algebraic Geometric codes on minimal Hirzebruch surfaces;We define a linear code $C_\eta(\delta_T,\delta_X)$ by evaluating polynomials of bidegree $(\delta_T,\delta_X)$ in the Cox ring on $\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of the Hirzebruch surface of parameter $\eta$ on the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. We give explicit parameters of the code, notably using Gr\"obner bases. The minimum distance provides an upper bound of the number of $\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of a non-filling curve on a Hirzebruch surface.;cs.IT
1801.08409;Computation of the State Bias and Initial States for Stochastic State Space Systems in the General 2-D Roesser Model Form;Recently \cite{Ramos2017a} presented a subspace system identification algorithm for 2-D purely stochastic state space models in the general Roesser form. However, since the exact problem requires an oblique projection of $Y_f^h$ projected onto $W_p^h$ along $\widehat{X}_f^{vh}$, where $W_p^h= \begin{bmatrix}\widehat{X}_p^{vh} \\ Y_p^h \end{bmatrix}$, this presents a problem since $\{\widehat{X}_p^{vh},\widehat{X}_f^{vh}\}$ are unknown. In the above mentioned paper, the authors found that by doing an orthogonal projection $Y_f^h/Y_p^h$, one can identify the future horizontal state matrix $\widehat{X}_f^{h}$ with a small bias due to the initial conditions that depend on $\{\widehat{X}_p^{vh},\widehat{X}_f^{vh}\}$. Nevertheless, the results on modeling 2-D images were very good despite lack of knowledge of $\{\widehat{X}_p^{vh},\widehat{X}_f^{vh}\}$. In this note we delve into the bias term and prove that it is insignificant, provided $i$ is chosen large enough and the vertical and horizontal states are uncorrelated. That is, the cross covariance of the state estimates $x_{r,s}^{h}$ and $x_{r,s}^{v}$ is zero, or $P_{hv}=0_{n_x\times n_x}$ and $P_{vh}=0_{n_x\times n_x}$. Our simulations use $i=30$. We also present a second iteration to improve the state estimates by including the vertical states computed from a vertical data processing step, i.e., by doing an orthogonal projection $Y_f^v/Y_p^v$. In this revised algorithm we include a step to compute the initial states. This new portion, in addition to the algorithm presented in \cite{Ramos2017a}, forms a complete 2-D stochastic subspace system identification algorithm.;math.NA
1801.08411;Global existence of solutions to 2-D Navier-Stokes flow with non-decaying initial data in half-plane;We investigate the Navier-Stokes initial boundary value problem in the half-plane $R^2_+$ with initial data $u_0 \in L^\infty(R^2_+)\cap J_0^2(R^2_+)$ or with non decaying initial data $u_0\in L^\infty(R^2_+) \cap J_0^p(R^2_+), p &gt, 2$ . We introduce a technique that allows to solve the two-dimesional problem, further, but not least, it can be also employed to obtain weak solutions, as regards the non decaying initial data, to the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes IBVP. This last result is the first of its kind.;math.AP
1801.08413;Mean-field risk sensitive control and zero-sum games for Markov chains;We establish existence of controlled Markov chain of mean-field type with unbounded jump intensities by means of a fixed point argument using the Wasserstein distance. Using a Markov chain entropic backward SDE approach, we further suggest conditions for existence of an optimal control and a saddle-point for respectively a control problem and a zero-sum differential game associated with risk sensitive payoff functionals of mean-field type.;math.PR
1801.08422;Multi-peak semiclassical solutions for Fractional Schr&#xf6,dinger Equations with Potential Vanishing at Infinity;We study the following fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equation \begin{equation}\label{eq0.1} \varepsilon^{2s}(-\Delta)^s u + Vu = |u|^{p - 2}u, \,\,x\in\,\,\mathbb{R}^N, \end{equation} <br />where $p\in (2 + 2s/(N - 2s), 2^*_s)$, $2^*_s=2N/(N-2s),\,N\ge 2s$, $V\in C(\mathbb{R}^N,[0,\infty))$. We show that the problem has a family of solutions concentrating at any prescribed finite set of local minima of $V$ provided that $\liminf_{|x|\to \infty}V(x)|x|^{2s} &gt, 0$. The proof is based on variational methods and penalized technique. Key words: fractional Schr\"{o}dinger, multi-peak, vanishing potential, penalized technique, variational methods.;math.AP
1801.08425;On Sidorenko&#x27,s conjecture for determinants and Gaussian Markov random fields;We study a class of determinant inequalities that are closely related to Sidorenko's famous conjecture (Also conjectured by Erd\H os and Simonovits in a different form). Our main result can also be interpreted as an entropy inequality for Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRF). We call a GMRF on a finite graph $G$ homogeneous if the marginal distributions on the edges are all identical. We show that if $G$ is bipartite then the differential entropy of any homogeneous GMRF on $G$ is at least $|E(G)|$ times the edge entropy plus $|V(G)|-2|E(G)|$ times the point entropy. We also show that in the case of non-negative correlation on edges, the result holds for an arbitrary graph $G$. The connection between Sidorenko's conjecture and GMRF's is established via a large deviation principle on high dimensional spheres combined with graph limit theory. Connection with Ihara zeta function and the number of spanning trees is also discussed.;math.CO
1801.08428;Discrete projective minimal surfaces;We propose a natural discretisation scheme for classical projective minimal surfaces. We follow the classical geometric characterisation and classification of projective minimal surfaces and introduce at each step canonical discrete models of the associated geometric notions and objects. Thus, we introduce discrete analogues of classical Lie quadrics and their envelopes and classify discrete projective minimal surfaces according to the cardinality of the class of envelopes. This leads to discrete versions of Godeaux-Rozet, Demoulin and Tzitzeica surfaces. The latter class of surfaces requires the introduction of certain discrete line congruences which may also be employed in the classification of discrete projective minimal surfaces. The classification scheme is based on the notion of discrete surfaces which are in asymptotic correspondence. In this context, we set down a discrete analogue of a classical theorem which states that an envelope (of the Lie quadrics) of a surface is in asymptotic correspondence with the surface if and only if the surface is either projective minimal or a Q surface. Accordingly, we present a geometric definition of discrete Q surfaces and their relatives, namely discrete counterparts of classical semi-Q, complex, doubly Q and doubly complex surfaces.;math.DG
1801.08429;Moderate deviations for stochastic models of two-dimensional second grade fluids driven by L&#x27,evy noise;In this paper, we establish a moderate deviation principle for stochastic models of two-dimensional second grade fluids driven by L\'evy noise. We will adopt the weak convergence approach. Because of the appearance of jumps, this result is significantly different from that in Gaussian case.;math.PR
1801.08430;An example of the geometry of a 5th-order ODE: the metric on the space of conics in ${\mathbb{CP}}^2$;As an application of the method of [4], we find the metric and connection on the space of conics in $\mathbb{CP}^2$ determined as the solution space of the ODE eqn(1). These calculations underpin the twistor construction of the Radon transform on conics in $\mathbb{CP}^2$ described in [5]. Two further examples of the method are provided.;math.DG
1801.08433;The $(\mathfrak{gl}_m,\mathfrak{gl}_n$) duality in the quantum toroidal setting;On a Fock space constructed from $mn$ free bosons and lattice ${\Bbb {Z}}^{mn}$, we give a level $n$ action of the quantum toroidal algebra $\mathscr {E}_m$ associated to $\mathfrak{gl}_m$, together with a level $m$ action of the quantum toroidal algebra ${\mathscr E}_n$ associated to ${\mathfrak {gl}}_n$. We prove that the $\mathscr {E}_m$ transfer matrices commute with the $\mathscr {E}_n$ transfer matrices after an appropriate identification of parameters.;math.QA
1801.08436;Dual Free Adaptive Minibatch SDCA for Empirical Risk Minimization;In this paper we develop an adaptive dual free Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent (adfSDCA) algorithm for regularized empirical risk minimization problems. This is motivated by the recent work on dual free SDCA of Shalev-Shwartz (2016). The novelty of our approach is that the coordinates to update at each iteration are selected non-uniformly from an adaptive probability distribution, and this extends the previously mentioned work which only allowed for a uniform selection of "dual" coordinates from a fixed probability distribution. <br />We describe an efficient iterative procedure for generating the non-uniform samples, where the scheme selects the coordinate with the greatest potential to decrease the sub-optimality of the current iterate. We also propose a heuristic variant of adfSDCA that is more aggressive than the standard approach. Furthermore, in order to utilize multi-core machines we consider a mini-batch adfSDCA algorithm and develop complexity results that guarantee the algorithm's convergence. The work is concluded with several numerical experiments to demonstrate the practical benefits of the proposed approach.;math.OC
1801.08437;Fast Algorithm for Calculating the Minimal Annihilating Polynomials of Matrices via Pseudo Annihilating Polynomials;Minimal annihilating polynomials are very useful in a wide variety of algorithms in exact linear algebra. A new efficient method is proposed for calculating the minimal annihilating polynomials for all the unit vectors, for a square matrix over a field of characteristic zero. Key ideas of the proposed method are the concept of pseudo annihilating polynomial and the use of binary splitting technique. Efficiency of the resulting algorithms is shown by arithmetic time complexity analysis.;math.AC
1801.08442;Limit Operators, Compactness and Essential Spectra on Bounded Symmetric Domains;This paper is a follow-up to a recent article about the essential spectrum of Toeplitz operators acting on the Bergman space over the unit ball. As mentioned in the said article, some of the arguments can be carried over to the case of bounded symmetric domains and some cannot. The aim of this paper is to close the gaps to obtain comparable results for general bounded symmetric domains. In particular, we show that a Toeplitz operator on the Bergman space $A^p_{\nu}$ is Fredholm if and only if all of its limit operators are invertible. Even more generally, we show that this is in fact true for all band-dominated operators, an algebra that contains the Toeplitz algebra. Moreover, we characterize compactness and explain how the Berezin transform comes into play. In particular, we show that a bounded linear operator is compact if and only if it is band-dominated and its Berezin transform vanishes at the boundary. For $p = 2$ "band-dominated" can be replaced by "contained in the Toeplitz algebra".;math.FA
1801.08448;Symmetry breaking in planar and maximal outerplanar graphs;The distinguishing number (index) $D(G)$ ($D'(G)$) of a graph $G$ is the least integer $d$ such that $G$ has a vertex (edge) labeling with $d$ labels that is preserved only by a trivial automorphism. In this paper we consider the maximal outerplanar graphs (MOP graphs) and show that MOP graphs, except $K_3$, can be distinguished by at most two vertex (edge) labels. We also compute the distinguishing number and the distinguishing index of Halin and Mycielskian graphs.;math.CO
1801.08449;Singular Cw-Expansive Flows;We study continuum-wise expansive flows with fixed points on metric spaces and low dimensional manifolds. We give sufficient conditions for a surface flow to be singular cw-expansive and examples showing that cw-expansivity does not imply expansivity. We also construct a singular Axiom A vector field on a three-manifold being singular cw-expansive and with a Lorenz attractor and a Lorenz repeller in its non-wandering set.;math.DS
1801.08452;Generic Dynamics on Compact Metric Spaces;We prove that generically and modulo a topological conjugacy there is only one dynamical system.;math.DS
1801.08453;Failure of $L^2$ boundedness of gradients of single layer potentials for measures with zero low density;Consider a totally irregular measure $\mu$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, that is, the upper density $\limsup_{r\to0}\frac{\mu(B(x,r))}{(2r)^n}$ is positive $\mu$-a.e.\ in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, and the lower density $\liminf_{r\to0}\frac{\mu(B(x,r))}{(2r)^n}$ vanishes $\mu$-a.e. in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. We show that if $T_\mu f(x)=\int K(x,y)\,d\mu(y)$ is an operator whose kernel $K(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the gradient of the fundamental solution for a uniformly elliptic operator in divergence form associated with a matrix with H\"older continuous coefficients, then $T_\mu$ is not bounded in $L^2(\mu)$. This extends a celebrated result proved previously by Eiderman, Nazarov and Volberg for the $n$-dimensional Riesz transform.;math.CA
1801.08456;Determining sets and determining numbers of finite groups;Let $G$ be a group. A subset $D$ of $G$ is a determining set of $G$, if every automorphism of $G$ is uniquely determined by its action on $D$. The determining number of $G$, denoted by $\alpha(G)$, is the cardinality of a smallest determining set. A generating set of $G$ is a subset such that every element of $G$ can be expressed as the combination, under the group operation, of finitely many elements of the subset and their inverses. The cardinality of a smallest generating set of $G$, denoted by $\gamma(G)$, is called the generating number of $G$. A group $G$ is called a DEG-group if $\alpha(G)=\gamma(G)$. <br />The main results of this article are as follows. Finite groups with determining number $0$ or $1$ are classified, Finite simple groups and finite nilpotent groups are proved to be DEG-groups, A finite group is a normal subgroup of a DEG-group and there is an injective mapping from the set all finite groups to the set of finite DEG-groups, Nilpotent groups of order $n$ which have the maximum determining number are classified, For any integer $k\geq 2$, there exists a group $G$ such that $\alpha(G)=2$ and $\gamma(G)\geq k$.;math.GR
1801.08458;$p$-bases and differential operators on varieties defined over a non-perfect field;Let $k$ be a possibly non-perfect field of characteristic $p &gt, 0$. In this work we prove the local existence of absolute $p$-bases for regular algebras of finite type over $k$. Namely, consider a regular variety $Z$ over $k$. Kimura and Niitsuma proved that, for every $\xi \in Z$, the local ring $\mathcal{O}_{Z,\xi}$ has a $p$-basis over $\mathcal{O}_{Z,\xi}^p$. Here we show that, for every $\xi \in Z$, there exists an open affine neighborhood of $\xi$, say $\xi \in \text{Spec}(A) \subset Z$, so that $A$ admits a $p$-basis over $A^p$. <br />This passage from the local ring to an affine neighborhood of $\xi$ has geometrical consequences, some of which will be discussed in the second part of the article. As we will see, given a $p$-basis $\mathcal{B}$ of the algebra $A$ over $A^p$, there is a family of differential operators on $A$ naturally associated to $\mathcal{B}$. These differential operators will enable us to give a Jacobian criterion for regularity for varieties defined over $k$, as well as a method to compute the order of an ideal $I \subset A$.;math.AC
1801.08460;Frobenius linear translators giving rise to new infinite classes of permutations and bent functions;We show the existence of many infinite classes of permutations over finite fields and bent functions by extending the notion of linear translators, introduced by Kyureghyan [12]. We call these translators Frobenius translators since the derivatives of $f : F_{p^n} \rightarrow F_{p^k}$, where $n = rk$, are of the form $f(x + u\phi) - f(x) = u^{p^i}b$, for a fixed $b \in F_{p^k}$ and all $u \in F_{p^k}$, rather than considering the standard case corresponding to $i = 0$. This considerably extends a rather rare family {f} admitting linear translators of the above form. Furthermore, we solve a few open problems in the recent article [4] concerning the existence and an exact specification of $f$ admitting classical linear translators, and an open problem introduced in [9] of finding a triple of bent functions $f_1, f_2, f_3$ such that their sum $f_4$ is bent and that the sum of their duals $f_1* +f_2* +f_3* +f_4* = 1$. Finally, we also specify two huge families of permutations over $F_{p^n}$ related to the condition that $G(y) = -L(y)+(y+\delta)^s -(y+\delta)^{p^ks}$ permutes the set $S =\{\beta \in F_{p^n} : Tr^n_k(\beta) = 0\}$, where $n = 2k$ and $p &gt, 2$. Finally, we offer generalizations of constructions of bent functions from [16] and described some new bent families using the permutations found in [4].;math.AC
1801.08461;Rescaled expansivity and separating flows;In this article we give sufficient conditions for Komuro expansivity to imply the rescaled expansivity recently introduced by Wen and Wen. Also, we show that a flow on a compact metric space is expansive in the sense of Katok-Hasselblatt if and only if it is separating in the sense of Gura and the set of fixed points is open.;math.DS
1801.08462;Weyl invariant $E_8$ Jacobi forms;We investigate $W(E_8)$-invariant Jacobi forms which are the Jacobi forms invariant under the action of the Weyl group of the root system $E_8$. This type of Jacobi forms has applications in mathematics and physics, but very little has been known about its structure. In this paper we show that the bigraded ring of weak $W(E_8)$-invariant Jacobi forms is not a polynomial algebra over $C$ and prove that every $W(E_8)$-invariant Jacobi form can be expressed uniquely as a polynomial in nine algebraically independent holomorphic Jacobi forms introduced by Sakai with coefficients which are meromorphic $SL_2(Z)$ modular forms. The latter result implies that the graded ring of weak $W(E_8)$-invariant Jacobi forms of fixed index is a free module over the ring of $SL_2(Z)$ modular forms and the number of generators can be calculated by a generating series. We also determine and construct all generators of small index. These results extend Wirthm\"{u}ller's theorem proved in 1992 to the last open case.;math.NT
1801.08464;Algebraic multigrid preconditioners for two-phase flow in porous media with phase transitions;Multiphase flow is a critical process in a wide range of applications, including oil and gas recovery, carbon sequestration, and contaminant remediation. Numerical simulation of multiphase flow requires solving of a large, sparse linear system resulting from the discretization of the partial differential equations modeling the flow. In the case of multiphase multicomponent flow with miscible effect, this is a very challenging task. The problem becomes even more difficult if phase transitions are taken into account. A new approach to handle phase transitions is to formulate the system as a nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP). Unlike in the primary variable switching technique, the set of primary variables in this approach is fixed even when there is phase transition. Not only does this improve the robustness of the nonlinear solver, it opens up the possibility to use multigrid methods to solve the resulting linear system. The disadvantage of the complementarity approach, however, is that when a phase disappears, the linear system has the structure of a saddle point problem and becomes indefinite, and current algebraic multigrid (AMG) algorithms cannot be applied directly. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of a new multilevel strategy, based on the multigrid reduction technique, to deal with problems of this type. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method through numerical results for the case of two-phase, two-component flow with phase appearance/disappearance. We also show that the strategy is efficient and scales optimally with problem size.;math.NA
1801.08469;Joint and Conditional Local Limit Theorems for Lattice Random Walks and Their Occupation Measures;Let $S_n$ be a lattice random walk with mean zero and finite variance, and let $\Lambda^a_n$ be its occupation measure at level $a$. In this note, we prove local limit theorems for $\Pr[S_n=x,\Lambda^a_n=\ell]$ and $\Pr[S_n=x|\Lambda^a_n=\ell]$ in the cases where $a$, $|x-a|$ and $\ell$ are either zero or at least of order $\sqrt n$. The asymptotic description of these quantities matches the corresponding probabilities for Brownian motion and its local time process. <br />This note can be seen as a generalization of previous results by Kaigh (1975) and Uchiyama (2011). In similar fashion to these results, our method of proof relies on path decompositions that reduce the problem at hand to the study of random walks with independent increments.;math.PR
1801.08471;Affine Grassmannians in A^1-algebraic topology;Let k be a field. Denote by Spc(k)_* the unstable, pointed motivic homotopy category and by Omega_Gm: Spc(k)_* \to Spc(k)_* the Gm-loops functor. For a k-group G, denote by Gr_G the affine Grassmannian of G. If G is isotropic reductive, we provide a canonical motivic equivalence Omega_Gm G = Gr_G. If k is perfect, we use this to compute the motive M(Omega_Gm G) in DM(k, Z).;math.AG
1801.08472;$L_\infty$-resolutions and twisting in the curved context;In this short note we describe an alternative global version of the twisting procedure used by Dolgushev to prove formality theorems. This allows us to describe the maps of Fedosov resolutions, which are key factors of the formality morphisms, in terms of a twist of the fiberwise quasi-isomorphisms induced by the local formality theorems proved by Kontsevich and Shoikhet. The key point consists in considering $L_\infty$-resolutions of the Fedosov resolutions obtained by Dolgushev and an adapted notion of Maurer-Cartan element. This allows us to perform the twisting of the quasi-isomorphism intertwining them in a global manner.;math.QA
1801.08475;Explicit formula for the average of Goldbach and prime tuples representations;Let $\Lambda\left(n\right)$ be the Von Mangoldt function, let \[ r_{G}\left(n\right)=\underset{{\scriptstyle m_{1}+m_{2}=n}}{\sum_{m_{1},m_{2}\leq n}}\Lambda\left(m_{1}\right)\Lambda\left(m_{2}\right), \] \[ r_{PT}\left(N,h\right)=\sum_{n=0}^{N}\Lambda\left(n\right)\Lambda\left(n+h\right),\,h\in\mathbb{N} \] be the counting function of the Goldbach numbers and the counting function of the prime tuples, respectively. Let $N&gt,2$ be an integer. We will find the explicit formulae for the averages of $r_{G}\left(n\right)$ and $r_{PT}\left(N,h\right)$ in terms of elementary functions, the incomplete Beta function $B_{z}\left(a,b\right)$, series over $\rho$ that, with or without subscript, runs over the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann Zeta function and the Dilogarithm function. We will also prove the explicit formulae in an asymptotic form and a truncated formula for the average of $r_{G}\left(n\right)$. Some observation about these formulae and the average with Ces\`aro weight \[ \frac{1}{\Gamma\left(k+1\right)}\sum_{n\leq N}r_{G}\left(n\right)\left(N-n\right)^{k},\,k&gt,0 \] are included.;math.NT
1801.08478;Small-amplitude static periodic patterns at a fluid-ferrofluid interface;We establish the existence of static doubly periodic patterns (in particular rolls, rectangles and hexagons) on the free surface of a ferrofluid near onset of the Rosensweig instability, assuming a general (nonlinear) magnetisation law. A novel formulation of the ferrohydrostatic equations in terms of Dirichlet- Neumann operators for nonlinear elliptic boundary- value problems is presented. We demonstrate the analyticity of these operators in suitable function spaces and solve the ferrohydrostatic problem using an analytic version of Crandall-Rabinowitz local bifurcation theory. Criteria are derived for the bifurcations to be sub-, super- or transcritical with respect to a dimensionless physical parameter.;math.AP
1801.08484;Arbitrary-order functionally fitted energy-diminishing methods for gradient systems;It is well known that for gradient systems in Euclidean space or on a Riemannian manifold, the energy decreases monotonically along solutions. In this letter we derive and analyse functionally fitted energy-diminishing methods to preserve this key property of gradient systems. It is proved that the novel methods are unconditionally energy-diminishing and can achieve damping for very stiff gradient systems. We also show that the methods can be of arbitrarily high order and discuss their implementations. A numerical test is reported to illustrate the efficiency of the new methods in comparison with three existing numerical methods in the literature.;math.NA
1801.08490;Tempered distributions with discrete support and spectrum;We investigate properties of tempered distributions with discrete or countable supports such that their Fourier transforms are distributions with discrete or countable supports as well. We find sufficient conditions for support of the distribution to be a finite union of translations of a full-rank lattice.;math.CA
1801.08492;Bounds on special values of L-functions of elliptic curves in an Artin-Schreier family;In this paper, we study a certain Artin--Schreier family of elliptic curves over the function field $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$. We prove an asymptotic estimate on the size of the special value of their $L$-function in terms of the degree of their conductor, loosely speaking, we show that the special values are "asymptotically as large as possible". <br />We also provide an explicit expression for the $L$-function of the elliptic curves in the family. The proof of the main result uses this expression and a detailed study of the distribution of some character sums related to Kloosterman sums. Via the BSD conjecture, the main result translates into an analogue of the Brauer--Siegel theorem for these elliptic curves.;math.NT
1801.08499;Learning general sparse additive models from point queries in high dimensions;We consider the problem of learning a $d$-variate function $f$ defined on the cube $[-1,1]^d\subset {\mathbb R}^d$, where the algorithm is assumed to have black box access to samples of $f$ within this domain. Denote ${\mathcal S}_r \subset {[d] \choose r}, r=1,\dots,r_0$ to be sets consisting of unknown $r$-wise interactions amongst the coordinate variables. We then focus on the setting where $f$ has an additive structure, i.e., it can be represented as $$f = \sum_{{\mathbf j} \in {\mathcal S}_1} \phi_{{\mathbf j}} + \sum_{{\mathbf j} \in {\mathcal S}_2} \phi_{{\mathbf j}} + \dots + \sum_{{\mathbf j} \in {\mathcal S}_{r_0}} \phi_{{\mathbf j}},$$ where each $\phi_{{\mathbf j}}$, ${\mathbf j} \in {\cal S}_r$ is at most $r$-variate for $1 \leq r \leq r_0$. We derive randomized algorithms that query $f$ at carefully constructed set of points, and exactly recover each ${\mathcal S}_r$ with high probability. In contrary to the previous work, our analysis does not rely on numerical approximation of derivatives by finite order differences.;math.NA
1801.08503;Convex Integration Arising in the Modelling of Shape-Memory Alloys: Some Remarks on Rigidity, Flexibility and Some Numerical Implementations;We study convex integration solutions in the context of the modelling of shape-memory alloys. The purpose of the article is two-fold, treating both rigidity and flexibility properties: Firstly, we relate the maximal regularity of convex integration solutions to the presence of lower bounds in variational models with surface energy. Hence, variational models with surface energy could be viewed as a selection mechanism allowing for or excluding convex integration solutions. Secondly, we present the first numerical implementations of convex integration schemes for the model problem of the geometrically linearised two-dimensional hexagonal-to-rhombic phase transformation. We discuss and compare the two algorithms from [RZZ16] and [RZZ17].;math.AP
1801.08506;Stable 3D FDTD Method for arbitrary Fully Electric and Magnetic Anisotropic Maxwell Equations;We have developed a new fully anisotropic 3D FDTD Maxwell solver for arbitrary electrically and magnetically anisotropic media for piecewise constant electric and magnetic materials that are co-located over the primary computational cells. Two numerical methods were developed that are called non-averaged and averaged methods, respectively. The non-averaged method is first order accurate, while the averaged method is second order accurate for smoothly-varying materials and reduces to first order for discontinuous material distributions. For the standard FDTD field locations with the co-location of the electric and magnetic materials at the primary computational cells, the averaged method require development of the different inversion algorithms of the constitutive relations for the electric and magnetic fields. We provide a mathematically rigorous stability proof followed by extensive numerical testing that includes long-time integration, eigenvalue analysis, tests with extreme, randomly placed material parameters, and various boundary conditions. For accuracy evaluation we have constructed a test case with an explicit analytic solution. Using transformation optics, we have constructed complex, spatially inhomogeneous geometrical object with fully anisotropic materials and a large dynamic range of $\underline{\epsilon}$ and $\underline{\mu}$, such that a plane wave incident on the object is perfectly reconstructed downstream. In our implementation, the considerable increase in accuracy of the averaged method only increases the computational run time by 20%.;math.NA
1801.08507;On $\ell_4 : \ell_2$ ratio of functions with restricted Fourier support;Given a subset $A \subseteq \{0,1\}^n$, let $\mu(A)$ be the maximal ratio between $\ell_4$ and $\ell_2$ norms of a function whose Fourier support is a subset of $A$. We make some simple observations about the connections between $\mu(A)$ and the additive properties of $A$ on one hand, and between $\mu(A)$ and the uncertainty principle for $A$ on the other hand. One application obtained by combining these observations with results in additive number theory is a stability result for the uncertainty principle on the discrete cube. <br />Our more technical contribution is determining $\mu(A)$ rather precisely, when $A$ is a Hamming sphere $S(n,k)$ for all $0 \le k \le n$.;math.CO
1801.08512;Inference in high-dimensional graphical models;We provide a selected overview of methodology and theory for estimation and inference on the edge weights in high-dimensional directed and undirected Gaussian graphical models. For undirected graphical models, two main explicit constructions are provided: one based on a global method that maximizes the joint likelihood (the graphical Lasso) and one based on a local (nodewise) method that sequentially applies the Lasso to estimate the neighbourhood of each node. The proposed estimators lead to confidence intervals for edge weights and recovery of the edge structure. We evaluate their empirical performance in an extensive simulation study. The theoretical guarantees for the methods are achieved under a sparsity condition relative to the sample size and regularity conditions. For directed acyclic graphs, we apply similar ideas to construct confidence intervals for edge weights, when the directed acyclic graph is identifiable.;math.ST
1801.08516;Multiplicity of positive solutions for a quasilinear Schr&#xf6,dinger equation with an almost critical nonlinearity;In this paper we prove an existence result of multiple positive solutions for the following quasilinear problem \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{array}[c]{ll} -\Delta u - \Delta (u^2)u = |u|^{p-2}u &amp, \mbox{ in } \Omega u= 0 &amp,\mbox{ on } \partial\Omega, \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} where $\Omega$ is a smooth and bounded domain in $\mathbb R^{N},N\geq3$. More specifically we prove that, for $p$ near the critical exponent $22^{*}=4N/(N-2)$, the number of positive solutions is estimated below by topological invariants of the domain $\Omega$: the Ljusternick-Schnirelmann category and the Poincar\'e polynomial.;math.AP
1801.08518;Monotonicity results for the first Steklov eigenvalue on compact surfaces;We show several results comparing sharp eigenvalue bounds for the first Steklov eigenvalue on surfaces under change of the topology. Among others, we obtain strict monotonicity in the genus. Combined with results of the second named author \cite{petrides_2} this implies the existence of free boundary minimal immersions from higher genus surfaces into Euclidean balls. Moreover, we can also give a new proof of a result by Fraser and Schoen that shows monotonicity in the number of boundary components.;math.DG
1801.08524;On a class of immersions of spheres into space forms of nonpositive curvature;Let $ M^{n+1} $ ($ n \ge 2 $) be a simply-connected space form of sectional curvature $ -\kappa^2 $ for some $ \kappa \geq 0 $, and $ I $ an interval not containing $ [-\kappa,\kappa] $ in its interior. It is known that the domain of a closed immersed hypersurface of $ M $ whose principal curvatures lie in $ I $ must be diffeomorphic to the sphere $ S^n $. These hypersurfaces are thus topologically rigid. <br />The purpose of this paper is to show that they are also homotopically rigid. More precisely, for fixed $ I $, the space $ \mathscr{F} $ of all such closed hypersurfaces is either empty or weakly homotopy equivalent to the group of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of $ S^n $. An equivalence assigns to each element of $ \mathscr{F} $ a suitable modification of its Gauss map. For $ M $ not simply-connected, $ \mathscr{F} $ is the quotient of the corresponding space of hypersurfaces of the universal cover of $ M $ by a natural free proper action of the fundamental group of $ M $.;math.GT
1801.08528;Formulating Categorical Concepts using Classes;We examine the use of classes to formulate several categorical notions. This leads to two proposals: an explicit structure for working with subobjects, and a hierarchy of $k$-classes. We apply the latter to both ordinary and higher categories.;math.CT
1801.08529;Fuchsian Equations with Three Non-Apparent Singularities;We show that for every second order Fuchsian linear differential equation $E$ with $n$ singularities of which $n-3$ are apparent there exists a hypergeometric equation $H$ and a linear differential operator with polynomial coefficients which maps the space of solutions of $H$ into the space of solutions of $E$. This map is surjective for generic parameters. This justifies one statement of Klein (1905). We also count the number of such equations $E$ with prescribed singularities and exponents. We apply these results to the description of conformal metrics of curvature $1$ on the punctured sphere with conic singularities, all but three of them having integer angles.;math.CA
1801.08531;A randomized and fully discrete Galerkin finite element method for semilinear stochastic evolution equations;In this paper the numerical solution of non-autonomous semilinear stochastic evolution equations driven by an additive Wiener noise is investigated. We introduce a novel fully discrete numerical approximation that combines a standard Galerkin finite element method with a randomized Runge-Kutta scheme. Convergence of the method to the mild solution is proven with respect to the $L^p$-norm, $p \in [2,\infty)$. We obtain the same temporal order of convergence as for Milstein-Galerkin finite element methods but without imposing any differentiability condition on the nonlinearity. The results are extended to also incorporate a spectral approximation of the driving Wiener process. An application to a stochastic partial differential equation is discussed and illustrated through a numerical experiment.;math.NA
1801.08533;How long does it take for Internal DLA to forget its initial profile?;Internal DLA is a discrete model of a moving interface. On the cylinder graph $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}$, a particle starts uniformly on $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \{0\}$ and performs simple random walk on the cylinder until reaching an unoccupied site in $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$, which it occupies forever. This operation defines a Markov chain on subsets of the cylinder. We first show that a typical subset is rectangular with at most logarithmic fluctuations. We use this to prove that two Internal DLA chains started from different typical subsets can be coupled with high probability by adding order $N^2 \log N$ particles. For a lower bound, we show that at least order $N^2$ particles are required to forget which of two independent typical subsets the process started from.;math.PR
1801.08550;Two-Player Pebbling on Diameter 2 Graphs;A pebbling move refers to the act of removing two pebbles from one vertex and placing one pebble on an adjacent vertex. The goal of graph pebbling is: Given an initial distribution of pebbles, use pebbling moves to reach a specified goal vertex called the root. The pebbling number of a graph $\pi(G)$ is the minimum number of pebbles needed so every distribution of $\pi(G)$ pebbles can reach every choice of the root. We introduce a new variant of graph pebbling, a game between two players. One player aims to move a pebble to the root and the other player aims to prevent this. We show configurations of various classes of graphs for which each player has a winning strategy. We will characterize the winning player for a specific class of diameter two graphs.;math.CO
1801.08561;Exotic components of $\mathrm{SO}(p,q)$ surface group representations, and their Higgs bundle avatars;For semisimple Lie groups, moduli spaces of Higgs bundles on a Riemann surface correspond to representation varieties for the surface fundamental group. In many cases, natural topological invariants label connected components of the moduli spaces. Hitchin representations into split real forms, and maximal representations into Hermitian Lie groups, are the only previously know cases where natural invariants do not fully distinguish connected components. In this note we announce the existence of new such exotic components in the moduli spaces for the groups $\mathrm{SO}(p,q)$ with $2&lt,p&lt,q$. These groups lie outside formerly know classes of groups associated with exotic components.;math.AG
1801.08564;An Asymptotically Tight Bound on the Number of Relevant Variables in a Bounded Degree Boolean Function;We prove that there is a constant $C\leq 6.614$ such that every Boolean function of degree at most $d$ (as a polynomial over $\mathbb{R}$) is a $C\cdot 2^d$-junta, i.e. it depends on at most $C\cdot 2^d$ variables. This improves the $d\cdot 2^{d-1}$ upper bound of Nisan and Szegedy [Computational Complexity 4 (1994)]. Our proof uses a new weighting scheme where we assign weights to variables based on the highest degree monomial they appear on. <br />The bound of $C\cdot 2^d$ is tight up to the constant $C$ as a lower bound of $2^d-1$ is achieved by a read-once decision tree of depth $d$. We slightly improve the lower bound by constructing, for each positive integer $d$, a function of degree $d$ with $3\cdot 2^{d-1}-2$ relevant variables. A similar construction was independently observed by Shinkar and Tal.;math.CO
1801.08581;Quasi-equilibrium problems with generalized monotonicity;In this work, we propose a new existence result for quasi-equilibrium problems using generalized monotonicity in an infinite dimensional space. Also, we show that the notions of generalized monotonicity can be characterized in terms of solution sets of equilibrium problems and convex feasibility problems. Moreover, we show that the concept of pseudomonotonicity and upper sign property are related under suitable assumptions.;math.OC
1801.08590;Individual testing is optimal for nonadaptive group testing in the linear regime;We consider nonadaptive probabilistic group testing in the linear regime, where each of n items is defective independently with probability p in (0,1), and p is a constant independent of n. We show that testing each item individually is optimal, in the sense that with fewer than n tests the error probability is bounded away from zero.;cs.IT
1801.08593;Subconvex bounds on GL(3) via degeneration to frequency zero;For a fixed cusp form $\pi$ on $\operatorname{GL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$ and a varying Dirichlet character $\chi$ of prime conductor $q$, we prove that the subconvex bound \[ L(\pi \otimes \chi, \tfrac{1}{2}) \ll q^{3/4 - \delta} \] holds for any $\delta &lt, 1/36$. This improves upon the earlier bounds $\delta &lt, 1/1612$ and $\delta &lt, 1/308$ obtained by Munshi using his $\operatorname{GL}_2$ variant of the $\delta$-method. The method developed here is more direct. We first express $\chi$ as the degenerate zero-frequency contribution of a carefully chosen summation formula \`a la Poisson. After an elementary "amplification" step exploiting the multiplicativity of $\chi$, we then apply a sequence of standard manipulations (reciprocity, Voronoi, Cauchy--Schwarz and the Weil bound) to bound the contributions of the nonzero frequencies and of the dual side of that formula.;math.NT
1801.08595;Lattice self-similar sets on the real line are not Minkowski measurable;We show that any nontrivial self-similar subset of the real line that is invariant under a lattice iterated function system (IFS) satisfying the open set condition (OSC) is not Minkowski measurable. So far, this was only known for special classes of such sets. Thereby, we provide the last puzzle-piece in proving that under OSC a nontrivial self-similar subset of the real line is Minkowski measurable iff it is invariant under a nonlattice IFS, a 25-year-old conjecture.;math.DS
1801.08596;Solitons of general topological charge over noncommutative tori;We continue the study of solitons over noncommutative tori from the perspective of time-frequency analysis and treat the case of a general topological charge. Solutions are associated with vector bundles of higher rank over noncommutative tori. We express these vector bundles in terms of vector-valued Gabor frames and apply the duality theory of Gabor analysis to show that Gaussians are solitons of general topological charge over noncommutative tori. An energy functional for projections over noncommutative tori is the basis for the self and anti-self duality equations of the solitons which turns out to have a reformulation in terms of Gabor atoms and we prove that projections generated by Gaussians minimize this energy functional. Finally, we comment on the case of the Moyal plane and the associated continuous vector-valued Gabor frames and show that Gaussians are the only class of solitons.;math-ph
1801.08597;Some remarks on the simplicial volume of nonpositively curved manifolds;We show that any closed manifold with a metric of nonpositive curvature that admits either a single point rank condition or a single point curvature condition has positive simplicial volume. We use this to provide a differential geometric proof of a conjecture of Gromov in dimension three.;math.GT
1801.08601;MmWave Channel Estimation via Atomic Norm Minimization for Multi-User Hybrid Precoding;To perform multi-user multiple-input and multiple-output transmission in millimeter-wave(mmWave) cellular systems, the high-dimensional channels need to be estimated for designing the multi-user precoder. Conventional grid-based compressed sensing (CS) methods for mmWave channel estimation suffer from the basis mismatch problem, which prevents accurate channel reconstruction and degrades the precoding performance. This paper formulates mmWave channel estimation as an Atomic Norm Minimization (ANM) problem. In contrast to grid-based CS methods which use discrete dictionaries, ANM uses a continuous dictionary for representing the mmWave channel. We consider a continuous dictionary based on sub-sampling in the antenna domain via a small number of radio frequency chains. We show that mmWave channel estimation using ANM can be formulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, and the user channel can be accurately estimated via off-the-shelf SDP solvers in polynomial time. Simulation results indicate that ANM can achieve much better estimation accuracy compared to grid-based CS, and significantly improves the spectral efficiency provided by multi-user precoding.;cs.IT
1801.08608;On finite elements in $f$-algebras and in product algebras;Finite elements, which are well-known and studied in the framework of vector lattices, are investigated in $\ell$-algebras, preferably in $f$-algebras, and in product algebras. The additional structure of an associative multiplication leads to new questions and some new properties concerning the collections of finite, totally finite and self-majorizing elements. In some cases the order ideal of finite elements is a ring ideal as well. It turns out that a product of elements in an $f$-algebra is a finite element if at least one factor is finite. If the multiplicative unit exists, the latter plays an important role in the investigation of finite elements. For the product of certain $f$-algebras an element is finite in the algebra if and only if its power is finite in the product algebra.;math.FA
1801.08610;Infinitesimal part of Weak Lefschetz using Milnor $K-$ theory;Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over a field of characteristic $0$ and $L$ an ample divisor. In this paper we study the Weak Lefschetz conjecture for Chow groups using the technique employed by Grothendieck in his study of the problem for Picard groups, and using Bloch's formula to interpret Chow groups in terms of Milnor $K$- theory we prove the infinitesimal part of the conjecture.;math.AG
1801.08619;Local extension property for finite height spaces;We introduce a new technique for the study of the local extension property (LEP) for boolean algebras and we use it to show that the clopen algebra of every compact Hausdorff space $K$ of finite height has LEP. This implies, under appropriate additional assumptions on $K$ and Martin's Axiom, that every twisted sum of $c_0$ and $C(K)$ is trivial, generalizing a recent result by Marciszewski and Plebanek.;math.FA
1801.08622;Automatic rational approximation and linearization of nonlinear eigenvalue problems;We present a method for solving nonlinear eigenvalue problems using rational approximation. The method uses the AAA method by Nakatsukasa, S\`{e}te, and Trefethen to approximate the nonlinear eigenvalue problem by a rational eigenvalue problem and is embedded in the state space representation of a rational polynomial by Su and Bai. The advantage of the method, compared to related techniques such as NLEIGS and infinite Arnoldi, is the efficient computation by an automatic procedure. In addition, a set-valued approach is developed that allows building a low degree rational approximation of a nonlinear eigenvalue problem. The method perfectly fits the framework of the Compact rational Krylov methods (CORK and TS-CORK), allowing to efficiently solve large scale nonlinear eigenvalue problems. Numerical examples show that the presented framework is competitive with NLEIGS and usually produces smaller linearizations with the same accuracy but with less effort for the user.;math.NA
1801.08632;Connectedness of The Moduli Space of Artin-Schreier Curves of Fixed Genus;We study the moduli space $\mathcal{AS}_{g}$ of Artin-Schreier curves of genus $g$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ of positive characteristic $p$. The moduli space is partitioned by irreducible strata, where each stratum parameterizes Artin-Schreier curves whose ramification divisors have the same coefficients. We construct deformations of these curves to study the relations between those strata. As an application, when $p=3$, we prove that $\mathcal{AS}_{g}$ is connected for all possible $g$. When $p&gt,3$, it turns out that $\mathcal{AS}_{g}$ is connected for sufficiently large value of $g$. In the course of our work, we answer Pries and Zhu's question about how a combinatorial graph determines the geometry of $\mathcal{AS}_g$.;math.NT
1801.08634;New sharp inequalities for operator means;New sharp multiplicative reverses of the operator means inequalities are presented, with a simple discussion of squaring an operator inequality. As a direct consequence, we extend the operator P\'olya-Szeg\"o inequality to arbitrary operator means. Furthermore, we obtain some new lower and upper bounds for the Tsallis relative operator entropy, operator monotone functions and positive linear maps.;math.FA
1801.08638;On modules for meromorphic open-string vertex algebras;We study representations of the meromorphic open-string vertex algebra (MOSVAs hereafter) defined in [H3], a noncommutative generalization of vertex (operator) algebra. We start by recalling the definition of a MOSVA $V$ and left $V$-modules in [H3]. Then we define right $V$-modules and $V$-bimodules that reflect the noncommutative nature of $V$. When $V$ satisfies a condition on the order of poles of the correlation function (which we call pole-order condition), we prove that the rationality of products of two vertex operators implies the rationality of products of any numbers of vertex operators. Also, the rationality of iterates of any numbers of vertex operators is established, and is used to construct the opposite MOSVA $V^{op}$ of $V$. It is proved here that right (resp. left) $V$-modules are equivalent to left (resp. right) $V^{op}$-modules. Using this equivalence, we prove that if $V$ and a grading-restricted left $V$-module $W$ is endowed with a M\"obius structure, then the graded dual $W'$ of $W$ is a right $V$-module. This proof is the only place in this paper that needs the grading-restriction condition. Also, this result is generalized to not-grading-restricted modules under a strong pole-order condition that is satisfied by all existing examples of MOSVAs and modules.;math.QA
1801.08639;Fast binary embeddings, and quantized compressed sensing with structured matrices;This paper deals with two related problems, namely distance-preserving binary embeddings and quantization for compressed sensing . First, we propose fast methods to replace points from a subset $\mathcal{X} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, associated with the Euclidean metric, with points in the cube $\{\pm 1\}^m$ and we associate the cube with a pseudo-metric that approximates Euclidean distance among points in $\mathcal{X}$. Our methods rely on quantizing fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss embeddings based on bounded orthonormal systems and partial circulant ensembles, both of which admit fast transforms. Our quantization methods utilize noise-shaping, and include Sigma-Delta schemes and distributed noise-shaping schemes. The resulting approximation errors decay polynomially and exponentially fast in $m$, depending on the embedding method. This dramatically outperforms the current decay rates associated with binary embeddings and Hamming distances. Additionally, it is the first such binary embedding result that applies to fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss maps while preserving $\ell_2$ norms. <br />Second, we again consider noise-shaping schemes, albeit this time to quantize compressed sensing measurements arising from bounded orthonormal ensembles and partial circulant matrices. We show that these methods yield a reconstruction error that again decays with the number of measurements (and bits), when using convex optimization for reconstruction. Specifically, for Sigma-Delta schemes, the error decays polynomially in the number of measurements, and it decays exponentially for distributed noise-shaping schemes based on beta encoding. These results are near optimal and the first of their kind dealing with bounded orthonormal systems.;cs.IT
1801.08643;The Nonexistence of Noncompact Type-I Ancient 3-d $&#x3ba,$-Solutions of Ricci Flow with Positive Curvature;In this short paper, we show there do not exist three-dimensional noncompact $\kappa$-solutions of Ricci flow that have positive curvature and satisfy a Type-I bound. This represents progress towards the proof of Perelman's conjecture that the only complete noncompact three-dimensional $\kappa$-solution with positive curvature is the Bryant soliton.;math.DG
1801.08651;On Modelling and Complete Solutions to General Fixpoint Problems in Multi-Scale Systems with Applications;This paper revisits the well-studied fixed point problem from a unified viewpoint of mathematical modeling and canonical duality theory, i.e. the original problem is first reformulated as a nonconvex optimization problem, its well-posedness is discussed based on objectivity principle in continuum physics, then the canonical duality theory is applied for solving this problem to obtain not only all fixed points, but also their stability properties. Applications are illustrated by challenging problems governed by nonconvex polynomial, exponential, and logarithmic operators. This paper shows that within the framework of the canonical duality theory, there is no difference between the fixed point problems and nonconvex analysis/optimization in multidisciplinary studies.;math.OC
1801.08655;The method of polarized traces for the 3D Helmholtz equation;We present a fast solver for the 3D high-frequency Helmholtz equation in heterogeneous, constant density, acoustic media. The solver is based on the method of polarized traces, coupled with distributed linear algebra libraries and pipelining to obtain an empirical online runtime $ \mathcal{O}(\max(1,R/n) N \log N)$ where $N = n^3$ is the total number of degrees of freedom and $R$ is the number of right-hand sides. Such a favorable scaling is a prerequisite for large-scale implementations of full waveform inversion (FWI) in frequency domain.;math.NA
1801.08656;On the complex-representable excluded minors for real-representability;We show that each real-representable matroid is a minor of a complex-representable excluded minor for real-representability. More generally, for an infinite field $\mathbb{F}_1$ and a field extension $\mathbb{F}_2$, if $\mathbb{F}_1$-representability is not equivalent to $\mathbb{F}_2$-representability, then each $\mathbb{F}_1$-representable matroid is a minor of a $\mathbb{F}_2$-representable excluded minor for $\mathbb{F}_1$-representability.;math.CO
1801.08661;Regularity for an anisotropic equation in the plane;We present a simple proof of the $C^1$ regularity of $p$-anisotropic functions in the plane for $2\leq p&lt,\infty$. We achieve a logarithmic modulus of continuity for the derivatives. The monotonicity (in the sense of Lebesgue) of the derivatives is used. The case with two exponents is also included.;math.AP
1801.08670;A class of Meijer&#x27,s G functions and further representations of the generalized hypergeometric functions;In this paper we investigate the Meijer's $G$ function $G^{p,1}_{p+1,p+1}$ which for certain parameter values represents the Riemann-Liouville fractional integral of Meijer-N{\o}rlund function $G^{p,0}_{p,p}$. Our results for $G^{p,1}_{p+1,p+1}$ include: a regularization formula for overlapping poles, a connection formula with the Meijer-N{\o}rlund function, asymptotic formulas around the origin and unity, formulas for the moments, a hypergeometric transform and a sign stabilization theorem for growing parameters. We further employ the properties of $G^{p,1}_{p+1,p+1}$ to calculate the Hadamard finite part of an integral containing the Meijer-N{\o}rlund function that is singular at unity. In the ultimate section, we define an alternative regularization for such integral better suited for representing the Bessel type generalized hypergeometric function ${}_{p-1}F_{p}$. A particular case of this regularization is then used to identify some new facts about the positivity and reality of the zeros of this function.;math.CA
1801.08680;${\rm SL}(m,C)$-equivariant and translation covariant continuous tensor valuations;The space of continuous, ${\rm SL}(m,C)$-equivariant, $m\geq 2$, and translation covariant valuations taking values in the space of real symmetric tensors on $C^m\cong R^{2m}$ of rank $r\geq 0$ is completely described. The classification involves the moment tensor valuation for $r\geq 1$ and is analogous to the classification of the corresponding tensor valuations that are ${\rm SL}(2m,R)$-equivariant, although the method of proof cannot be adapted.;math.MG
1801.08681;Absolutely split metacyclic groups and weak metacirculants;Let $m,n,r$ be positive integers, and let $G=\langle a\rangle: \langle b\rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}_n: \mathbb{Z}_m$ be a split metacyclic group such that $b^{-1}ab=a^r$. We say that $G$ is {\em absolutely split with respect to $\langle a\rangle$} provided that for any $x\in G$, if $\langle x\rangle\cap\langle a\rangle=1$, then there exists $y\in G$ such that $x\in\langle y\rangle$ and $G=\langle a\rangle: \langle y\rangle$. In this paper, we give a sufficient and necessary condition for the group $G$ being absolutely split. This generalizes a result of Sanming Zhou and the second author in [arXiv: <a href="/abs/1611.06264">1611.06264v1</a>]. We also use this result to investigate the relationship between metacirculants and weak metacirculants. <br />Metacirculants were introduced by Alspach and Parsons in $1982$ and have been a rich source of various topics since then. As a generalization of this classes of graphs, Maru\v si\v c and \v Sparl in 2008 posed the so called weak metacirculants. A graph is called a {\em weak metacirculant} if it has a vertex-transitive metacyclic automorphism group. In this paper, it is proved that a weak metacirculant of $2$-power order is a metacirculant if and only if it has a vertex-transitive split metacyclic automorphism group. This provides a partial answer to an open question in the literature.;math.CO
1801.08684;Radius of Uniform Convexity of some special functions;In this investigation our main aim is to determine the radius of uniform convexity of the some normalized q-Bessel and Wright functions. Here we consider six different normalized forms of q-Bessel functions, while we apply three different kinds of normalizations of Wright function. Also, we have shown that the obtained radii are the smallest positive roots of some functional equations.;math.CV
1801.08685;On the Coherent Labelling Conjecture of a Polyhedron in Three Dimensions;In this article we consider an open conjecture about coherently labelling a polyhedron in three dimensions. We exhibit all the forty eight possible coherent labellings of a tetrahedron. We also exhibit that some simplicial polyhedra like bipyramids, Kleetopes, gyroelongated bipyramids are coherently labellable. Also we prove that pyramids over $n$-gons for $n\geq 4$, which are not simplicial polyhedra, are coherently labellable. We prove that among platonic solids, the cube and the dodecahedron are not coherently labellable, even though, the tetrahedron, the octahedron and the icosahedron are coherently labellable. Unlike the case of a tetrahedron, in general for a polyhedron, we show that a coherent labelling need not induce a coherent labelling at a vertex. We prove the main conjecture in the affirmative for a certain class of polyhedra which are constructible from tetrahedra through certain types of edge and face vanishing tetrahedron attachments. As a consequence we conclude that a cube cannot be obtained from only these type of tetrahedron attachments. We also give an obstruction criterion for a polyhedron to be not coherently labellable and consequentially show that any polyhedron obtained from a pyramid with its apex chopped off is not coherently labellable. Finally with the suggestion of the affirmative results we prove the main theorem that any simplicial polyhedron is coherently labellable.;math.CO
1801.08691;On Quasi-Newton Forward--Backward Splitting: Proximal Calculus and Convergence;We introduce a framework for quasi-Newton forward--backward splitting algorithms (proximal quasi-Newton methods) with a metric induced by diagonal $\pm$ rank-$r$ symmetric positive definite matrices. This special type of metric allows for a highly efficient evaluation of the proximal mapping. The key to this efficiency is a general proximal calculus in the new metric. By using duality, formulas are derived that relate the proximal mapping in a rank-$r$ modified metric to the original metric. We also describe efficient implementations of the proximity calculation for a large class of functions, the implementations exploit the piece-wise linear nature of the dual problem. Then, we apply these results to acceleration of composite convex minimization problems, which leads to elegant quasi-Newton methods for which we prove convergence. The algorithm is tested on several numerical examples and compared to a comprehensive list of alternatives in the literature. Our quasi-Newton splitting algorithm with the prescribed metric compares favorably against state-of-the-art. The algorithm has extensive applications including signal processing, sparse recovery, machine learning and classification to name a few.;math.OC
1801.08692;Trisections of 4-manifolds with Boundary;Given a handle decomposition of a 4-manifold with boundary, and an open book decomposition of the boundary, we show how to produce a trisection diagram of a trisection of the 4-manifold inducing the given open book. We do this by making the original proof of the existence of relative trisections more explicit, in terms of handles. Furthermore, we extend this existence result to the case of 4-manifolds with multiple boundary components, and show how trisected 4-manifolds with multiple boundary components glue together.;math.GT
1801.08693;Improved Finite Blocklength Converses for Slepian-Wolf Coding via Linear Programming;A new finite blocklength converse for the Slepian- Wolf coding problem is presented which significantly improves on the best known converse for this problem, due to Miyake and Kanaya [2]. To obtain this converse, an extension of the linear programming (LP) based framework for finite blocklength point- to-point coding problems from [3] is employed. However, a direct application of this framework demands a complicated analysis for the Slepian-Wolf problem. An analytically simpler approach is presented wherein LP-based finite blocklength converses for this problem are synthesized from point-to-point lossless source coding problems with perfect side-information at the decoder. New finite blocklength metaconverses for these point-to-point problems are derived by employing the LP-based framework, and the new converse for Slepian-Wolf coding is obtained by an appropriate combination of these converses.;cs.IT
1801.08695;An inverse result of approximation by sampling Kantorovich series;In the present paper, an inverse result of approximation, i.e., a saturation theorem for the sampling Kantorovich operators is derived, in the case of uniform approximation for uniformly continuous and bounded functions on the whole real line. In particular, here we prove that the best possible order of approximation that can be achieved by the above sampling series is the order one, otherwise the function being approximated turns to be a constant. The above result is proved by exploiting a suitable representation formula which relates the sampling Kantorovich series with the well-known generalized sampling operators introduced by P.L. Butzer. At the end, some other applications of such representation formula are presented, together with a discussion concerning the kernels of the above operators for which such an inverse result occurs.;math.FA
1801.08696;Uniqueness and nondegeneracy of ground states to nonlinear scalar field equations involving the Sobolev critical exponent in their nonlinearities for high frequencies;The study of the uniqueness and nondegeneracy of ground state solutions to semilinear elliptic equations is of great importance because of the resulting energy landscape and its implications for the various dynamics. In [AIKN3], semilinear elliptic equations with combined power-type nonlinearities involving the Sobolev critical exponent are studied. There, it is shown that if the dimension is four or higher, and the frequency is sufficiently small, then the positive radial ground state is unique and nondegenerate. In this paper, we extend these results to the case of high frequencies when the dimension is five and higher. After suitably rescaling the equation, we demonstrate that the main behavior of the solutions is given by the Sobolev critical part for which the ground states are explicit, and their degeneracy is well characterized. Our result is a key step towards the study of the different dynamics of solutions of the corresponding nonlinear Schr\"odinger and Klein-Gordon equations with energies above the energy of the ground state. Our restriction on the dimension is mainly due to the existence of resonances in dimension three and four.;math.AP
1801.08698;Average values of functionals and concentration without measure;Although there doesn't exist the Lebesgue measure in the ball $M$ of $C[0,1]$ with $p-$norm, the average values (expectation) $EY$ and variance $DY$ of some functionals $Y$ on $M$ can still be defined through the procedure of limitation from finite dimension to infinite dimension. In particular, the probability densities of coordinates of points in the ball $M$ exist and are derived out even though the density of points in $M$ doesn't exist. These densities include high order normal distribution, high order exponent distribution. This also can be considered as the geometrical origins of these probability distributions. Further, the exact values (which is represented in terms of finite dimensional integral) of a kind of infinite-dimensional functional integrals are obtained, and specially the variance $DY$ is proven to be zero, and then the nonlinear exchange formulas of average values of functionals are also given. Instead of measure, the variance is used to measure the deviation of functional from its average value. $DY=0$ means that a functional takes its average on a ball with probability 1 by using the language of probability theory, and this is just the concentration without measure. In addition, we prove that the average value depends on the discretization.;math.PR
1801.08703;Trapped modes and reflectionless modes as eigenfunctions of the same spectral problem;We consider the reflection-transmission problem in a waveguide with obstacle. At certain frequencies, for some incident waves, intensity is perfectly transmitted and the reflected field decays exponentially at infinity. In this work, we show that such reflectionless modes can be characterized as eigenfunctions of an original non-selfadjoint spectral problem. In order to select ingoing waves on one side of the obstacle and outgoing waves on the other side, we use complex scalings (or Perfectly Matched Layers) with imaginary parts of different signs. We prove that the real eigenvalues of the obtained spectrum correspond either to trapped modes (or bound states in the continuum) or to reflectionless modes. Interestingly, complex eigenvalues also contain useful information on weak reflection cases. When the geometry has certain symmetries, the new spectral problem enters the class of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric problems.;math.NA
1801.08704;Event-triggered stabilization of disturbed linear systems over digital channels;We present an event-triggered control strategy for stabilizing a scalar, continuous-time, time-invariant, linear system over a digital communication channel having bounded delay, and in the presence of bounded system disturbance. We propose an encoding-decoding scheme, and determine lower bounds on the packet size and on the information transmission rate which are sufficient for stabilization. We show that for small values of the delay, the timing information implicit in the triggering events is enough to stabilize the system with any positive rate. In contrast, when the delay increases beyond a critical threshold, the timing information alone is not enough to stabilize the system and the transmission rate begins to increase. Finally, large values of the delay require transmission rates higher than what prescribed by the classic data-rate theorem. The results are numerically validated using a linearized model of an inverted pendulum.;math.OC
1801.08705;Vaccinate your trees!;For a graph $G$ and an integer-valued function $\tau$ on its vertex set, a dynamic monopoly is a set of vertices of $G$ such that iteratively adding to it vertices $u$ of $G$ that have at least $\tau(u)$ neighbors in it eventually yields the vertex set of $G$. We study two vaccination problems, where the goal is to maximize the minimum order of such a dynamic monopoly either by increasing the threshold value of $b$ vertices beyond their degree, or by removing $b$ vertices from $G$, where $b$ is a given non-negative integer corresponding to a budget. We show how to solve these problems efficiently for trees.;math.CO
1801.08713;Generalized Dynamics in Social Networks With Antagonistic Interactions;In this paper, we investigate a general nonlinear model of opinion dynamics in which both state-dependent susceptibility to persuasion and antagonistic interactions are considered. According to the existing literature and socio-psychological theories, we examine three specializations of state-dependent susceptibility, that is, stubborn positives scenario, stubborn neutrals scenario, and stubborn extremists scenario. Interactions among agents form a signed graph, in which positive and negative edges represent friendly and antagonistic interactions, respectively. Based on Perron-Frobenius property of eventually positive matrices and LaSalle invariance principle, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the generalized nonlinear opinion dynamics. We obtain some sufficient conditions such that the states of all agents converge into the subspace spanned by the right positive eigenvector of an eventually positive matrix. When there exists at least one entry of the right positive eigenvector which is not equal to one, the derived results can be used to describe different levels of an opinion. Finally, we present two examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical findings.;math.OC
1801.08715;A Class of Conserved Surface Layer Integrals for Causal Variational Principles;In the theory of causal fermion systems, the physical equations are obtained as the Euler-Lagrange equations of a causal variational principle.

1801.08719;On Uniform Admissibility of Unitary and Smooth Representations;Let $G$ be a locally compact totally disconnected topological group. Under a necessary mild assumption, we show that the irreducible unitary representations of $G$ are uniformly admissible if and only if the irreducible smooth representations of $G$ are uniformly admissible. We also show that the latter property is inherited by finite-index subgroups and overgroups of $G$.;math.RT
1801.08721;On the Reynolds time-averaged equations and the long-time behavior of Leray-Hopf weak solutions, with applications to ensemble averages;We consider the three dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with non stationary source terms f chosen in a suitable space. We prove the existence of Leray-Hopf weak solutions and that it is possible to characterize (up to sub-sequences) their long-time averages, which satisfy the Reynolds averaged equations, involving a Reynolds stress. Moreover, we show that the turbulent dissipation is bounded by the sum of the Reynolds stress work and of the external turbulent fluxes, without any additional assumption, than that of dealing with Leray-Hopf weak solutions. Finally, in the last section we consider ensemble averages of solutions, associated to a set of different forces and we prove that the fluctuations continue to have a dissipative effect on the mean flow.;math.AP
1801.08724;Concentration of random graphs and application to community detection;Random matrix theory has played an important role in recent work on statistical network analysis. In this paper, we review recent results on regimes of concentration of random graphs around their expectation, showing that dense graphs concentrate and sparse graphs concentrate after regularization. We also review relevant network models that may be of interest to probabilists considering directions for new random matrix theory developments, and random matrix theory tools that may be of interest to statisticians looking to prove properties of network algorithms. Applications of concentration results to the problem of community detection in networks are discussed in detail.;math.ST
1801.08728;Criteria for good reduction of proper polycurves;We give good reduction criteria for hyperbolic polycurves, i.e., successive extensions of families of curves, under mild assumption. These criteria are higher dimensional version of the good reduction criterion for hyperbolic curves given by Oda and Tamagawa.;math.NT
1801.08731;Highest perfect power of a product of integers less than $x$;For $x\geq 3$, we define $w(x)$ as the highest integer $w$ for which there exist integers $m, y\geq 1$ and $1\leq n_1&lt,\dots&lt,n_m\leq x$ such that $n_1\cdots n_m=y^w$. We show that \[w(x)=x\exp\big(-(\sqrt{2}+o(1))\sqrt{\log x\log\log x}\big).\];math.NT
1801.08732;Minimization of Frequency Deviations in Power Network by using majorant functions;Frequency control in power networks is designed to maintain power balance by adjusting generation, what allows to keep frequency at its nominal value (i.e. 50 Hz). If power disturbance occurs, it leads to frequency oscillations and deviation form nominal value, that are suppressed by the control. Behavior of the existing control depends on a number of parameters, that are currently chosen form the set, that guarantees control stability. But they can be adjusted within that set to increase control efficiency. The two main factors, that define efficiency are maximal frequency deviations and frequency convergence rate to equilibrium point. However frequencies functions on buses are highly oscillatory and have infinite amount of extremum. The aim of this work is firstly to present analytical conservative estimations of absolute values of frequencies deviations, in order to approximate dependence of frequency behavior on the control parameters and secondly present zero order optimization algorithm that would improve system dynamics by adjusting control parameters.;math.OC
1801.08733;An improved upper bound for the size of the multiplicative 3-Sidon sets;We say that a set is a multiplicative 3-Sidon set if the equation $s_1s_2s_3=t_1t_2t_3$ does not have a solution consisting of distinct elements taken from this set. In this paper we show that the size of a multiplicative 3-Sidon subset of $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ is at most $\pi(n)+\pi(n/2)+n^{2/3}(\log n )^{2^{1/3}-1/3+o(1)}$, which improves the previously known best bound $\pi(n)+\pi(n/2)+cn^{2/3}\log n/\log\log n$.;math.NT
1801.08740;The Toda and Painlev&#xe9, Systems Associated with Semiclassical Matrix-Valued Orthogonal Polynomials of Laguerre Type;Consider the Laguerre polynomials and deform them by the introduction in the measure of an exponential singularity at zero. In [Chen Y., Its A., J. Approx. Theory 162 (2010), 270-297, <a href="/abs/0808.3590">arXiv:0808.3590</a>] the authors proved that this deformation can be described by systems of differential/difference equations for the corresponding recursion coefficients and that these equations, ultimately, are equivalent to the Painlev\'e III equation and its B\"acklund/Schlesinger transformations. Here we prove that an analogue result holds for some kind of semiclassical matrix-valued orthogonal polynomials of Laguerre type.;math-ph
1801.08744;Open core and small groups in dense pairs of topological structures;Dense pairs of geometric topological fields have tame open core, that is, every definable open subset in the pair is already definable in the reduct. We fix a minor gap in the published version of van den Dries's seminal work on dense pairs of o-minimal groups, and show that every definable unary function in a dense pair of geometric topological fields agrees with a definable function in the reduct, off a small definable subset, that is, a definable set internal to the predicate. For certain dense pairs of geometric topological fields without the independence property, whenever the underlying set of a definable group is contained in the dense-codense predicate, the group law is locally definable in the reduct as a geometric topological field. If the reduct has elimination of imaginaries, we extend this result, up to interdefinability, to all groups internal to the predicate.;math.LO
1801.08745;New bounds on the dimensions of planar distance sets;We prove new bounds on the dimensions of distance sets and pinned distance sets of planar sets. Among other results, we show that if $A\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ is a Borel set of Hausdorff dimension $s&gt,1$, then its distance set has Hausdorff dimension at least $37/54\approx 0.685$. Moreover, if $s\in (1,3/2]$, then outside of a set of exceptional $y$ of Hausdorff dimension at most $1$, the pinned distance set $\{ |x-y|:x\in A\}$ has Hausdorff dimension $\ge \tfrac{2}{3}s$ and packing dimension at least $ \tfrac{1}{4}(1+s+\sqrt{3s(2-s)}) \ge 0.933$. These estimates improve upon the existing ones by Bourgain, Wolff, Peres-Schlag and Iosevich-Liu for sets of Hausdorff dimension $&gt,1$. Our proof uses a multi-scale decomposition of measures in which, unlike previous works, we are able to choose the scales subject to certain constrains. This leads to a combinatorial problem, which is a key new ingredient of our approach, and which we solve completely by optimizing certain variation of Lipschitz functions.;math.CA
1801.08748;Normal structure of isotropic reductive groups over rings;The paper studies the lattice of subgroups of an isotropic reductive group G(R) over a commutative ring R, normalized by the elementary subgroup E(R). We prove the sandwich classification theorem for this lattice under the assumptions that the reductive group scheme G is defined over an arbitrary commutative ring, its isotropic rank is at least 2, and the structure constants are invertible in R. The theorem asserts that the lattice splits into a disjoint union of sublattices (sandwiches) E(R,q)&lt,=...&lt,=C(R,q) parametrized by the ideals q of R, where E(R,q) denotes the relative elementary subgroup and C(R,q) is the inverse image of the center under the natural homomorphism G(R) to G(R/I). The main ingredients of the proof are the "level computation" by the first author and the universal localization method developed by the second author.;math.GR
1801.08751;Distances of optimal solutions of mixed-integer programs;A classic result of Cook et al. (1986) bounds the distances between optimal solutions of mixed-integer linear programs and optimal solutions of the corresponding linear relaxations. Their bound is given in terms of the number of variables and a parameter $ \Delta $, which quantifies sub-determinants of the underlying linear inequalities. We show that this distance can be bounded in terms of $ \Delta $ and the number of integer variables rather than the total number of variables. To this end, we make use of a result by Olson (1969) in additive combinatorics and demonstrate how it implies feasibility of certain mixed-integer linear programs. We conjecture that our bound can be improved to a function that only depends on $ \Delta $, in general.;math.OC
1801.08759;Toward free-surface flow simulations with correct energy evolution: an isogeometric level-set approach with monolithic time-integration;This paper presents a new monolithic free-surface formulation that exhibits correct kinetic and potential energy behavior. We focus in particular on the temporal energy behavior of two-fluids flow with varying densities. Correct energy behavior here means that the actual energy evolution of the numerical solution matches the evolution as predicted by the discrete two-fluid equations. We adopt the level-set method to describe the two-fluid surface. To ensure the correct energy behavior we augment the interface convection equation with kinetic and potential energy constraints. We solve the resulting formulation consisting of the fluid and interface equations in a monolithic fashion using a recently proposed level-set method [I. Akkerman. Monotone level-sets on arbitrary meshes without redistancing. Computers &amp, Fluids, 146:74-85, 2017.]. For the spatial discretization divergence-conforming NURBS are adopted. The resulting discrete equations are solved with a quasi-newton method which partially decouples the constraints from the rest of the problem. The simulation of a dambreak problem numerically supports the correct energy behavior of the proposed methodology. This improves the solution quality significantly upon a more traditional approach. Due to the excellent accuracy per degree of freedom one can suffice with a much lower resolution.;math.NA
1801.08762;Normality and quotient in crossed modules over groupoids and double groupoids;We consider the categorical equivalence between crossed modules over groupoids and double groupoids with thin structures, and by this equivalence, we prove how normality and quotient concepts are related in these two categories and give some examples of these objects.;math.CT
1801.08763;On the problem of non Berwaldian Landsberg spaces;In this paper, we study the long existence problem of non Berwaldian Landsberg spaces using the conformal transformation point of view. Under conformal transformation, the Berwald and Landesberg tensors are calculated in terms of the T-tensor. By giving examples, we show that under conformal transformation, there are Landsberg spaces with non-vanishing T-tensor. A necessary condition for a Landsberg space to be Berwaldian is given. Various special cases are studied. Cases in which the Landsberg spaces can not be Berwaldian are shown. Examples of non-Berwaldian landsberg (singular) spaces are given.;math.DG
1801.08765;Variants of Schanuel&#x27,s conjecture;This is a collection of variants of Schanuel's conjecture and the known dependencies between them. It was originally written in 2007, and made available for a time on my webpage. I have been asked by a few people to make it available again and have taken the opportunity to make some minor revisions now in January 2018. The treatment is far from exhaustive of the literature, and for the most part consists of statements which were under discussion in the Oxford logic group between around 2002 and 2007.;math.NT
1801.08770;Deterministic particle approximation for nonlocal transport equations with nonlinear mobility;We construct a deterministic, Lagrangian many-particle approximation to a class of nonlocal transport PDEs with nonlinear mobility arising in many contexts in biology and social sciences. The approximating particle system is a nonlocal version of the follow-the-leader scheme. We rigorously prove that a suitable discrete piece-wise density reconstructed from the particle scheme converges strongly in $L^1_{loc}$ towards the unique entropy solution to the target PDE as the number of particles tends to infinity. The proof is based on uniform BV estimates on the approximating sequence and on the verification of an approximated version of the entropy condition for large number of particles. As part of the proof, we also prove uniqueness of entropy solutions. We also provide a specific example of non-uniqueness of weak solutions and discuss about the interplay of the entropy condition with the steady states. Finally, we produce numerical simulations supporting the need of a concept of entropy solution in order to get a well-posed semigroup in the continuum limit, and showing the behaviour of solutions for large times.;math.AP
1801.08773;Symplectic deformations of Floer homology and non-contractible periodic orbits in twisted disc bundles;In this paper we establish the existence of periodic orbits belonging to any $\sigma$-atoroidal free homotopy class for Hamiltonian systems in the twisted disc bundle, provided that the compactly supported time-dependent Hamiltonian function is sufficiently large over the zero section and the magnitude of the weakly exact $2$-form $\sigma$ admitting a primitive with at most linear growth on the universal cover is sufficiently small. The proof relies on showing the invariance of Floer homology under symplectic deformations and on the computation of Floer homology for the cotangent bundle endowed with its canonical symplectic form. <br />As a consequence, we also prove that, for any nontrivial atoroidal free homotopy class and any positive finite interval, if the magnitude of a magnetic field admitting a primitive with at most linear growth on the universal cover is sufficiently small, the twisted geodesic flow associated to the magnetic field has a periodic orbit on almost every energy level in the given interval whose projection to the underlying manifold represents the given free homotopy class. This application is carried out by showing the finiteness of the restricted Biran-Polterovich-Salamon capacity.;math.SG
1801.08774;Polynomial Entropy and Expansivity;In this paper we study the polynomial entropy of homeomorphism on compact metric space. We construct a homeomorphism on a compact metric space with vanishing polynomial entropy that it is not equicontinuous. Also we give examples with arbitrarily small polynomial entropy. Finally, we show that expansive homeomorphisms and positively expansive maps of compact metric spaces with infinitely many points have polynomial entropy greater or equal than 1.;math.DS
1801.08775;Self-Similar Hyperbolicity;In this paper we consider expansive homeomorphisms of compact spaces with a hyperbolic metric presenting a self-similar behavior on stable and unstable sets. Several application are given related to Hausdorff dimension, entropy, intrinsically ergodic measures and the transitivity of expansive homeomorphisms with canonical coordinates.;math.DS
1801.08776;Skew Hadamard difference families and skew Hadamard matrices;In this paper, we generalize classical constructions of skew Hadamard difference families with two or four blocks in the additive groups of finite fields given by Szekeres (1969, 1971), Whiteman (1971) and Wallis-Whiteman (1972). In particular, we show that there exists a skew Hadamard difference family with $2^{u-1}$ blocks in the additive group of the finite field of order $q^e$ for any prime power $q\equiv 2^u+1\,({\mathrm{mod\, \, }2^{u+1}})$ with $u\ge 2$ and any positive integer $e$. In the aforementioned work of Szekeres, Whiteman, and Wallis-Whiteman, the constructions of skew Hadamard difference families with $2^{u-1}$ ($u=2$ or $3$) blocks in $({\mathbb F}_{q^e},+)$ depend on the exponent $e$, with $e\equiv 1,2,$ or $3\,({\mathrm{mod\, \, }4})$ when $u=2$, and $e\equiv 1\,({\mathrm{mod\, \, }2})$ when $u=3$, respectively. Our more general construction, in particular, removes the dependence on $e$. As a consequence, we obtain new infinite families of skew Hadamard matrices.;math.CO
1801.08777;Modeling tagged pedestrian motion: a mean-field type game approach;This paper suggests a model for the motion of tagged pedestrians: pedestrians moving towards a specified targeted destination, which they are forced to reach. It aims to be a decision-making tool for the positioning of fire fighters, security personnel, and other services in a pedestrian environment. Taking interaction with the surrounding crowd into account leads to a differential nonzero-sum game model where the tagged pedestrians compete with the surrounding crowd of ordinary pedestrians. When deciding how to act, pedestrians consider crowd distribution-dependent effects, like congestion and crowd aversion. Including such effects in the parameters of the game, makes it a mean-field type game. The equilibrium control is characterized, and special cases are discussed. Behavior in the model is studied by numerical simulations.;math.OC
1801.08778;Combinatorics of One-Dimensional Simple Toeplitz Subshifts;This paper provides a systematic study of fundamental combinatorial properties of one-dimensional, two-sided infinite simple Toeplitz subshifts. Explicit formulas for the complexity function, the palindrome complexity function and the repetitivity function are proven. Moreover, a complete description of the de Bruijn graphs of the subshifts is given. Finally, the Boshernitzan condition is characterised in terms of combinatorial quantities, based on a recent result of Liu and Qu. Particular simple characterisations are provided for simple Toeplitz subshifts that correspond to the orbital Schreier graphs of the family of Grigorchuk's groups, a class of subshifts that serves as main example throughout the paper.;math.DS
1801.08780;After Plancherel formula;We discuss two topics related to Fourier transforms on Lie groups and on homogeneous spaces: the operational calculus and the Gelfand--Gindikin problem (program) about separation of non-uniform spectra. Our purpose is to indicate some non-solved problems of non-commutative harmonic analysis that definitely are solvable. This is a sketch of my talks on VI School "Geometry and Physics", Bialowieza, Poland, June 2017.;math.RT
1801.08782;New structural results on tetravalent half-arc-transitive graphs;Tetravalent graphs admitting a half-arc-transitive subgroup of automorphisms, that is a subgroup acting transitively on its vertices and its edges but not on its arcs, are investigated. One of the most fruitful approaches for the study of structural properties of such graphs is the well known paradigm of alternating cycles and their intersections which was introduced by Maru\v{s}i\v{c} 20 years ago. <br />In this paper a new parameter for such graphs, giving a further insight into their structure, is introduced. Various properties of this parameter are given and the parameter is completely determined for the tightly attached examples in which any two non-disjoint alternating cycles meet in half of their vertices. Moreover, the obtained results are used to establish a link between two frameworks for a possible classification of all tetravalent graphs admitting a half-arc-transitive subgroup of automorphisms, the one proposed by Maru\v{s}i\v{c} and Praeger in 1999, and the much more recent one proposed by Al-bar, Al-kenai, Muthana, Praeger and Spiga which is based on the normal quotients method. <br />New results on the graph of alternating cycles of a tetravalent graph admitting a half-arc-transitive subgroup of automorphisms are obtained. A considerable step towards the complete answer to the question of whether the attachment number necessarily divides the radius in tetravalent half-arc-transitive graphs is made.;math.CO
1801.08783;Dendritations of Surfaces;In this paper we develop a generalization of foliated manifolds in the context of metric spaces. In particular we study dendritations of surfaces that are defined as maximal atlases of compatible upper semicontinuous local decompositions into dendrites. Applications are given in modeling stable and unstable sets of topological dynamical systems. For this purpose new forms of expansivity are defined.;math.DS
1801.08786;Hardy-Littlewood inequalities for multipolynomials;The notion of multipolynomials was recently introduced and explored by T. Velanga in [10] as an attempt to encompass the theories of polynomials and multi- linear operators. In the present paper we push this subject further, by proving Hardy- Littlewood inequalities for multipolynomials and, en passant, a variant of the Kahane- Salem-Zygmund inequality in this framework.;math.FA
1801.08792;Variance reduction method for particle transport equation in spherical geometry;This article is devoted to the design of importance sampling method for the Monte Carlo simulation of a linear transport equation. This model is of great importance in the simulation of inertial confinement fusion experiments. Our method is restricted to a spherically symmetric idealized design : an outer sphere emitting radiation towards an inner sphere, which in practice should be thought of as the hohlraum and the fusion capsule, respectively. We compute the importance function as the solution of the corresponding stationary adjoint problem. Doing so, we have an important reduction of the variance (by a factor 50 to 100), with a moderate increase of computational cost (by a factor 2 to 8).;math.NA
1801.08794;Branching diffusion representation for nonlinear Cauchyproblems and Monte Carlo approximation;We provide a probabilistic representations of the solution of some semilinear hyperbolicand high-order PDEs based on branching diffusions. These representations pave theway for a Monte-Carlo approximation of the solution, thus bypassing the curse ofdimensionality. We illustrate the numerical implications in the context of some popularPDEs in physics such as nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation, a simplied scalar versionof the Yang-Mills equation, a fourth-order nonlinear beam equation and the Gross-Pitaevskii PDEas an example of nonlinear Schrodinger equations.;math.PR
1801.08797;Exploiting Multiple Access in Clustered Millimeter Wave Networks: NOMA or OMA?;In this paper, we introduce a clustered millimeter wave network with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), where the base station (BS) is located at the center of each cluster and all users follow a Poisson Cluster Process. To provide a realistic directional beamforming, an actual antenna pattern is deployed at all BSs. We provide a nearest-random scheme, in which near user is the closest node to the corresponding BS and far user is selected at random, to appraise the coverage performance and universal throughput of our system. Novel closed-form expressions are derived under a loose network assumption. Moreover, we present several Monte Carlo simulations and numerical results, which show that: 1) NOMA outperforms orthogonal multiple access regarding the system rate, 2) the coverage probability is proportional to the number of possible NOMA users and a negative relationship with the variance of intra-cluster receivers, and 3) an optimal number of the antenna elements is existed for maximizing the system throughput.;cs.IT
1801.08799;Who is the infector? General multi-type epidemics and real-time susceptibility processes;We couple a multi-type stochastic epidemic process with a directed random graph, where edges have random lengths. This random graph representation is used to characterise the fractions of individuals infected by the different types of vertices among all infected individuals in the large population limit. For this characterisation we rely on theory of multi-type real-time branching processes. We identify a special case of the two-type model, in which the fraction of individuals of a certain type infected by individuals of the same type, is maximised among all two-type epidemics approximated by branching processes with the same mean offspring matrix.;math.PR
1801.08800;Adaptive BDDC algorithms for the system arising from plane wave discretization of Helmholtz equations;Balancing domain decomposition by constraints (BDDC) algorithms with adaptive primal constraints are developed in a concise variational framework for the weighted plane wave least-squares (PWLS) discritization of Helmholtz equations with high and various wave numbers. The unknowns to be solved in this preconditioned system are defined on elements rather than vertices or edges, which are different from the well-known discritizations such as the classical finite element method. Through choosing suitable "interface" and appropriate primal constraints with complex coefficients and introducing some local techniques, we developed a two-level adaptive BDDC algorithm for the PWLS discretization, and the condition number of the preconditioned system is proved to be bounded above by a user-defined tolerance and a constant which is only dependent on the maximum number of interfaces per subdomain. A multilevel algorithm is also attempted to resolve the bottleneck in large scale coarse problem. Numerical results are carried out to confirm the theoretical results and illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.;math.NA
1801.08801;Modeling and Analysis of MmWave Communications in Cache-enabled HetNets;In this paper, we consider a novel cache-enabled heterogeneous network (HetNet), where macro base stations (BSs) with traditional sub-6 GHz are overlaid by dense millimeter wave (mmWave) pico BSs. These two-tier BSs, which are modeled as two independent homogeneous Poisson Point Processes, cache multimedia contents following the popularity rank. High-capacity backhauls are utilized between macro BSs and the core server. A maximum received power strategy is introduced for deducing novel algorithms of the success probability and area spectral efficiency (ASE). Moreover, Monte Carlo simulations are presented to verify the analytical conclusions and numerical results demonstrate that: 1) the proposed HetNet is an interference-limited system and it outperforms the traditional HetNets, 2) there exists an optimal pre-decided rate threshold that contributes to the maximum ASE, and 3) 73 GHz is the best mmWave carrier frequency regarding ASE due to the large antenna scale.;cs.IT
1801.08803;An expansive homeomorphism of a 3-manifold with a local stable set that is not locally connected;In this article we construct an expansive homeomorphism of a compact three-dimensional manifold with a fixed point whose local stable set is not locally connected. This homeomorphism is obtained as a topological perturbation of a quasi-Anosov diffeomorphism that is not Anosov.;math.DS
1801.08809;Mixed discontinuous Galerkin approximation of the elasticity eigenproblem;We introduce a discontinuous Galerkin method for the mixed formulation of the elasticity eigenproblem with reduced symmetry. The analysis of the resulting discrete eigenproblem does not fit in the standard spectral approximation framework since the underlying source operator is not compact and the scheme is nonconforming. We show that the proposed scheme provides a correct approximation of the spectrum and prove asymptotic error estimates for the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions. Finally, we provide several numerical tests to illustrate the performance of the method and confirm the theoretical results.;math.NA
1801.08811;Constructing LDPC Codes from Partition and Latin-Style Splicing;A novel method guaranteeing nondecreasing girth is presented for constructing longer low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes from shorter ones. The parity-check matrix of a shorter base code is decomposed into N (N&gt,=2) non-overlapping components with the same size. Then, these components are combined together to form the parity-check matrix of a longer code, according to a given N*N Latin square. To illustrate this method, longer quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes are obtained with girth at least eight and satisfactory performance, via shorter QC-LDPC codes with girth eight but poor performance. The proposed method naturally includes several well-known methods as special cases, but is much more general compared with these existing approaches.;cs.IT
1801.08814;Orientable hyperbolic 4-manifolds over the 120-cell;Since there is no hyperbolic Dehn filling theorem in higher dimensions, it is difficult to construct concrete hyperbolic manifolds of small volume in dimension at least four. We build up a census of closed hyperbolic 4-manifolds of volume $\frac{34\pi^2}{3}\cdot 16$ by using small cover theory over the right-angled 120-cell. In particular, we classify all the orientable 4-dimensional small covers over the 120-cell and obtain exactly 56 many up to homeomorphism. Moreover, we calculate the homologies of the obtained orientable closed hyperbolic 4-manifolds and all of them have even intersection forms.;math.GT
1801.08817;Strongly consistent autoregressive predictors in abstract Banach spaces;This work derives new results on strong consistent estimation and prediction for autoregressive processes of order 1 in a separable Banach space B. The consistency results are obtained for the componentwise estimator of the autocorrelation operator in the norm of the space $\mathcal{L}(B)$ of bounded linear operators on B. The strong consistency of the associated plug-in predictor then follows in the $B$-norm. A Gelfand triple is defined through the Hilbert space constructed in Kuelbs' Lemma \cite{Kuelbs70}. A Hilbert--Schmidt embedding introduces the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), generated by the autocovariance operator, into the Hilbert space conforming the Rigged Hilbert space structure.

1801.08818;Recovering initial values from light cone traces of solutions of the wave equation;We consider the problem of recovering the initial value, from the trace on the light cone, of the solution of an initial value problem for the wave equation. When the space is odd dimensional, we show that the map from the initial value to the traces of the (even or odd in time) solutions on the light cone is an isometry and we characterize the range of this map and construct its inverse. We do this by relating the problem to the recovery of a function from its spherical means over all spheres through the origin, which in turn is related to the Radon transform inversion via the inversion map on R^n.;math.AP
1801.08820;Reductions of modular Galois representations of Slope (2,3);We compute the semisimplifications of the mod-$p$ reductions of $2$-dimensional crystalline representations of $\Gal(\Q_p/\Q_p)$ of slope $(2,3)$ and arbitrary weight, building on work of Bhattacharya-Ghate;math.NT
1801.08821;Multiplication-Combination Tests for Incomplete Paired Data;We consider statistical procedures for hypothesis testing of real valued functionals of matched pairs with missing values. In order to improve the accuracy of existing methods, we propose a novel multiplication combination procedure. Dividing the observed data into dependent (completely observed) pairs and independent (incompletely observed) components, it is based on combining separate results of adequate tests for the two sub datasets. Our methods can be applied for parametric as well as semi- and nonparametric models and make efficient use of all available data. In particular, the approaches are flexible and can be used to test different hypotheses in various models of interest. This is exemplified by a detailed study of mean- as well as rank-based apporaches. Extensive simulations show that the proposed procedures are more accurate than existing competitors. A real data set illustrates the application of the methods.;math.ST

At the same time, some condition make the periodic coupling of AMO model is singular continuous.;math.DS
1801.08828;An ergodic problem for Mean Field Games: qualitative properties and numerical simulations;This paper is devoted to some qualitative descriptions and some numerical results for ergodic Mean Field Games systems which arise, e.g., in the homogenization with a small noise limit. We shall consider either power type potentials or logarithmic type ones. In both cases, we shall establish some qualitative properties of the effective Hamiltonian $\bar H$ and of the effective drift $\bar b$. In particular we shall provide two cases where the effective system keeps/looses the Mean Field Games structure, namely where $\nabla_P \bar H(P,\alpha)$ coincides or not with $\bar b(P, \alpha)$. <br />On the other hand, we shall provide some numerical tests validating the aforementioned qualitative properties of $\bar H$ and $\bar b$. In particular, we provide a numerical estimate of the discrepancy $\nabla_P \bar H(P,\alpha)-\bar b(P, \alpha)$.;math.AP
1801.08832;Asymptotic behavior and aging of a low temperature cascading 2-GREM dynamics at extreme time scales;We derive scaling limit results for the Random Hopping Dynamics for the cascading two-level GREM at low temperature at extreme time scales. It is known that in the cascading regime there are two static critical temperatures. We show that there exists a (narrow) set of fine tuning temperatures, when they lie below the static lowest critical temperature, three distinct dynamical phases emerge below the lowest critical temperature, with three different types of limiting dynamics depending on whether the temperature is (well) above or below, or at a fine tuning temperature, all of which are given in terms of K processes. We also derive scaling limit results for temperatures between the lowest and he highest critical ones, as well as aging results for all the limiting processes mentioned above, by taking a second small time limit.;math.PR

1801.08840;Path-space moderate deviations for a Curie-Weiss model of self-organized criticality;The dynamical Curie-Weiss model of self-organized criticality (SOC) was introduced in \cite{Gor17} and it is derived from the classical generalized Curie-Weiss by imposing a microscopic Markovian evolution having the distribution of the Curie-Weiss model of SOC [Cerf, Gorny 2016] as unique invariant measure. In the case of Gaussian single-spin distribution, we analyze the dynamics of moderate fluctuations for the magnetization. We obtain a path-space moderate deviation principle via a general analytic approach based on convergence of non-linear generators and uniqueness of viscosity solutions for associated Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Our result shows that, under a peculiar moderate space-time scaling and without tuning external parameters, the typical behavior of the magnetization is critical.;math.PR

We also present a complete description of the cohomological invariants. As an application, we show that the group of degree $3$ unramified cohomology of the classifying space $BG$ is trivial for all split semisimple groups $G$ of types $B$, $C$, and $D$.;math.AG
1801.08848;$S$-arithmetic Inhomogeneous Diophantine approximation on manifolds;We prove $S$-arithmetic inhomogeneous Khintchine type theorems on analytic nondegenerate manifolds. The divergence case, which constitutes the main substance of this paper, is proved in the general context of Hausdorff measures using ubiquitous systems. For $S$ consisting of more than one prime, finite or infinite, the divergence results are new even in the homogeneous setting. We also prove the convergence case of the theorem, including in particular, the $S$-arithmetic inhomogeneous counterpart of the Baker-Sprind\v{z}uk conjectures using nondivergence estimates for flows on homogeneous spaces in conjunction with the transference principle of Beresnevich and Velani.;math.NT
1801.08855;Color Lie rings and PBW deformations of skew group algebras;We investigate color Lie rings over finite group algebras and their universal enveloping algebras. We exhibit these universal enveloping algebras as PBW deformations of skew group algebras: Every color Lie ring over a finite group algebra with a particular Yetter-Drinfeld structure has universal enveloping algebra that is a quantum Drinfeld orbifold algebra. Conversely, every quantum Drinfeld orbifold algebra of a particular type arising from the action of an abelian group is the universal enveloping algebra of some color Lie ring over the group algebra. One consequence is that these quantum Drinfeld orbifold algebras are braided Hopf algebras.;math.RA
1801.08858;On the three-circle theorem and its applications in Sasakian manifolds;This paper mainly focuses on the CR analogue of the three-circle theorem in a complete noncompact pseudohermitian manifold of vanishing torsion being odd dimensional counterpart of K\"ahler geometry. In this paper, we show that the CR three-circle theorem holds if its pseudohermitian sectional curvature is nonnegative. As an application, we confirm the first CR Yau's uniformization conjecture and obtain the CR analogue of the sharp dimension estimate for CR holomorphic functions of polynomial growth and its rigidity when the pseudohermitian sectional curvature is nonnegative. This is also the first step toward second and third CR Yau's uniformization conjecture. Moreover, in the course of the proof of the CR three-circle theorem, we derive CR sub-Laplacian comparison theorem. Then Liouville theorem holds for positive pseudoharmonic functions in a complete noncompact pseudohermitian (2n+1)-manifold of vanishing torsion and nonnegative pseudohermitian Ricci curvature.;math.DG
1801.08859;On a new $q$-analogue of Appell polynomials;A new $q$-analogue of Appell polynomial sequences and their generalizations are introduced and their main characterizations are proved.

1801.08862;Expansions of Iterated Stratonovich Stochastic Integrals from the Taylor-Stratonovich Expansion, Based on Multiple Trigonometric Fourier Series. Comparison With the Milstein Expansion;The article is devoted to comparison of the Milstein expansion of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals with the method of expansion of iterated stochastic integrals, based on generalized multiple Fourier series. We consider some practical material connected with the expansions of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals from the Taylor-Stratonovich expansion, based on multiple trigonometric Fourier series. The comparison of effectiveness of the Fourier-Legendre series as well as the trigonomertic Fourier series for expansion of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals is considered.;math.PR

1801.08865;On the Broadcast Rate of Index Coding Problems with Symmetric and Consecutive Interference;A single unicast index coding problem (SUICP) with symmetric and consecutive interference (SCI) has $K$ messages and $K$ receivers, the $k$th receiver $R_k$ wanting the $k$th message $x_k$ and having interference $\mathcal{I}_k= \{x_{k-U-m},\dots,x_{k-m-2},x_{k-m-1}\}\cup\{x_{k+m+1}, x_{k+m+2},\dots,x_{k+m+D}\}$ and side-information $\mathcal{K}_k=(\mathcal{I}_k \cup x_k)^c$. In this paper, we derive a lowerbound on the broadcast rate of single unicast index coding problem with symmetric and consecutive interference (SUICP(SCI)). In the SUICP(SCI), if $m=0$, we refer this as single unicast index coding problem with symmetric and neighboring interference (SUICP(SNI)). In our previous work\cite{VaR5}, we gave the construction of near-optimal vector linear index codes for SUICP(SNI) with arbitrary $K,D,U$. In this paper, we convert the SUICP(SCI) into SUICP(SNI) and give the construction of near-optimal vector linear index codes for SUICP(SCI) with arbitrary $K,U,D$ and $m$. The constructed codes are independent of field size. The near-optimal vector linear index codes of SUICP(SNI) is a special case of near-optimal vector linear index codes constructed in this paper for SUICP(SCI) with $m=0$. In our previous work\cite{VaR6}, we derived an upperbound on broadcast rate of SUICP(SNI). In this paper, we give an upperbound on the broadcast rate of SUICP(SCI) by using our earlier result on the upperbound on the broadcast rate of SUICP(SNI). We derive the capacity of SUICP(SCI) for some special cases.;cs.IT
1801.08866;On blowup solutions to the focusing intercritical nonlinear fourth-order Schr&#xf6,dinger equation;In this paper we study dynamical properties of blowup solutions to the focusing intercritical (mass-supercritical and energy-subcritical) nonlinear fourth-order Schr\"odinger equation. We firstly establish the profile decomposition of bounded sequences in $\dot{H}^{\gamma_{\text{c}}} \cap \dot{H}^2$. We also prove a compactness lemma and a variational characterization of ground states related to the equation. As a result, we obtain the $\dot{H}^{\gamma_{\text{c}}}$-concentration of blowup solutions with bounded $\dot{H}^{\gamma_{\text{c}}}$-norm and the limiting profile of blowup solutions with critical $\dot{H}^{\gamma_{\text{c}}}$-norm.;math.AP
1801.08868;The number of geometrically distinct reversible closed geodesics on a Finsler sphere with $K\equiv 1$;In this paper we study the Finsler sphere $(S^n,F)$ with $n&gt,1$, which has constant flag curvature $K\equiv 1$ and only finite prime closed geodesics. In this case, the connected isometry group $I_0(S^n,F)$ must be a torus which dimension satisfies $0&lt,\dim I(S^n,F) \leq[\frac{n+1}{2}]$. We will prove that the number of geometrically distinct reversible closed geodesics on $(S^n,F)$ is at least $\dim I(S^n,F)$. When $\dim I_0(S^n,F)=[\frac{n+1}{2}]$, the equality happens, and there are exactly $2[\frac{n+1}{2}]$ prime closed geodesics, which verifies Anosov conjecture in this special case.;math.DG
1801.08870;Two-Stage Fourth-order Gas-kinetic Scheme for Three-dimensional Euler and Navier-Stokes Solutions;For the one-stage third-order gas-kinetic scheme (GKS), success applications have been achieved for the three-dimensional compressible flow computations [33]. The high-order accuracy of the scheme is obtained directly by integrating a multidimensional time-accurate gas distribution function over the cell interface within a time step without implementing Gaussian quadrature points and Runge-Kutta time-stepping technique. However, for the further increasing the order of the scheme, such as the fourth-order one, the formulation becomes very complicated for the multidimensional flow. Recently, a two-stage fourth-order GKS with high efficiency has been constructed for two-dimensional inviscid and viscous flow computations [22,32], and the scheme uses the time accurate flux function and its time derivatives. In this paper, a fourth-order GKS is developed for the threedimensional flows under the two-stage framework. Based on the three-dimensional WENO reconstruction and flux evaluation at Gaussian quadrature points on a cell interface, the high-order accuracy in space is achieved first. Then, the two-stage time stepping method provides the high accuracy in time. In comparison with the formal third-order GKS [33], the current fourth-order method not only improves the accuracy of the scheme, but also reduces the complexity of the gas-kinetic solver greatly. More importantly, the fourth-order GKS has the same robustness as the second-order shock capturing scheme. This scheme is applied to both inviscid and viscous, and low and high speed flow computations. Numerical results validate the outstanding reliability and applicability of the scheme for three-dimensional flows, such as turbulent one.;math.NA
1801.08871;Introduction to total dominator edge chromatic number;We introduce the total dominator edge chromatic number of a graph $G$. A total dominator edge coloring (briefly TDE-coloring) of $G$ is a proper edge coloring of $G$ in which each edge of the graph is adjacent to every edge of some color class. The total dominator edge chromatic number (briefly TDEC-number) $\chi'^t_d(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum number of color classes in a TDE-coloring of $G$. We obtain some properties of $\chi'^t_d(G)$ and compute this parameter for specific graphs. We examine the effects on $\chi'^t_d(G)$ when $G$ is modified by operations on vertex and edge of $G$. Finally, we consider the $k$-subdivison of $G$ and study TDEC-number of this kind of graphs.;math.CO
1801.08877;A Curie-Weiss Theory of the Continuum Widom-Rowlinson Model;A version of the continuum Widom-Rowlinson model is introduced and studied. It is a two-component gas of point particles placed in $\mathbf{R}^d$ in which like particles do not interact and unlike particles contained in a given vessel of volume $V$ repel each other with intensity $a/V$. This model is thermodynamically equivalent to a one-component gas with multi-particle interaction. For both models, a rigorous theory of a phase transition is presented and the ways of its construction in the framework of the grand canonical formalism are outlined.;math-ph
1801.08882;Symmetric Polynomials in Upper-bound Semirings;The fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials over rings is a classical result which states that every unital commutative ring is fully elementary, i.e. we can express symmetric polynomials with elementary ones in a unique way. The result does not extend directly to polynomials over semirings, but we do have analogous results for some special semirings, for example, the tropical, extended and supertropical semirings. These all fall into a larger class of upper-bound semirings. In this paper we extend the known results and give a complete characterization of fully elementary upper-bound semirings. We further improve this characterization statement in the case of linearly ordered upper-bound semirings.;math.AC
1801.08885;Fractional powers and singular perturbations of quantum differential Hamiltonians;We consider the fractional powers of singular (point-like) perturbations of the Laplacian, and the singular perturbations of fractional powers of the Laplacian, and we compare such two constructions focusing on their perturbative structure for resolvents and on the local singularity structure of their domains. In application to the linear and non-linear Schr\"{o}dinger equations for the corresponding operators we outline a programme of relevant questions that deserve being investigated.;math.FA
1801.08888;Antisymetric matrices and Lotka-Volterra algebras;The purpose of this paper is to study the structure of Lotka-Volterra algebras, the set of their idempotent elements and their group of automorphisms.

1801.08889;Non reflection and perfect reflection via Fano resonance in waveguides;We investigate a time-harmonic wave problem in a waveguide. By means of asymptotic analysis techniques, we justify the so-called Fano resonance phenomenon. More precisely, we show that the scattering matrix considered as a function of a geometrical parameter $\varepsilon$ and of the frequency $\lambda$ is in general not continuous at a point $(\varepsilon,\lambda)=(0,\lambda^0)$ where trapped modes exist. In particular, we prove that for a given $\varepsilon\ne0$ small, the scattering matrix exhibits a rapid change for frequencies varying in a neighbourhood of $\lambda^0$. We use this property to construct examples of waveguides such that the energy of an incident wave propagating through the structure is perfectly transmitted (non reflection) or perfectly reflected in monomode regime. We provide numerical results to illustrate our theorems.;math.AP
1801.08892;Comparison Between Robust and Stochastic Optimisation for Long-term Reservoir Operations Under Uncertainty;Long-term reservoir management often uses bounds on the reservoir level, between which the operator can work. However, these bounds are not always kept up-to-date with the latest knowledge about the reservoir drainage area, and thus become obsolete. The main difficulty with bounds computation is to correctly take into account the high uncertainty about the inflows to the reservoir. In this article, we propose a methodology to derive minimum bounds while providing formal guarantees about the quality of the obtained solutions. The uncertainty is embedded using either stochastic or robust programming in a model-predictive-control framework. We compare the two paradigms to the existing solution for a case study and find that the obtained solutions vary substantially. By combining the stochastic and the robust approaches, we also assign a confidence level to the solutions obtained by stochastic programming. The proposed methodology is found to be both efficient and easy to implement. It relies on sound mathematical principles, ensuring that a global optimum is reached in all cases.;math.OC

1801.08901;Detecting Changes in Fully Polarimetric SAR Imagery with Statistical Information Theory;Images obtained from coherent illumination processes are contaminated with speckle. A prominent example of such imagery systems is the polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR). For such remote sensing tool the speckle interference pattern appears in the form of a positive definite Hermitian matrix, which requires specialized models and makes change detection a hard task. The scaled complex Wishart distribution is a widely used model for PolSAR images. Such distribution is defined by two parameters: the number of looks and the complex covariance matrix. The last parameter contains all the necessary information to characterize the backscattered data and, thus, identifying changes in a sequence of images can be formulated as a problem of verifying whether the complex covariance matrices differ at two or more takes. This paper proposes a comparison between a classical change detection method based on the likelihood ratio and three statistical methods that depend on information-theoretic measures: the Kullback-Leibler distance and two entropies. The performance of these four tests was quantified in terms of their sample test powers and sizes using simulated data. The tests are then applied to actual PolSAR data. The results provide evidence that tests based on entropies may outperform those based on the Kullback-Leibler distance and likelihood ratio statistics.;cs.IT
1801.08903;Covering morphisms of internal groupoids in the models of a semi-abelian theory;In this paper, for given an algebraic theory $T$ whose category $C$ of models is semi-abelian, we consider the topological models of $T$ called topological $T$-algebras and obtain some results related to the fundamental groups of topological $T$-algebras. We also deal with the internal groupoid structure in the category of models providing that the fundamental groupoid deduces a functor from topological $T$-algebras to the internal groupoids in $C$ and prove a criterion for the lifting of such an internal groupoid structure to the covering groupoids.;math.CT
1801.08904;Maximum principle and its application for the nonlinear time-fractional diffusion equations with Cauchy-Dirichlet conditions;In this paper, a maximum principle for the one-dimensional sub-diffusion equation with Atangana-Baleanu fractional derivative is formulated and proved. The proof of the maximum principle is based on an extremum principle for the Atangana-Baleanu fractional derivative that is given in the paper, too. The maximum principle is then applied to show that the initial-boundary-value problem for the linear and nonlinear time-fractional diffusion equations possesses at most one classical solution and this solution continuously depends on the initial and boundary conditions.;math.AP
1801.08905;On Motzkin numbers and central trinomial coefficients;The Motzkin numbers $M_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom n{2k}\binom{2k}k/(k+1)$ $(n=0,1,2,\ldots)$ and the central trinomial coefficients $T_n$ ($n=0,1,2,\ldots)$ given by the constant term of $(1+x+x^{-1})^n$ have many combinatorial interpretations. In this paper we establish the following surprising arithmetic properties of them with $n$ any positive integer: $$\frac2n\sum_{k=1}^n(2k+1)M_k^2\in\mathbb Z,$$ $$\frac{n^2(n^2-1)}6\,\bigg|\,\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}k(k+1)(8k+9)T_kT_{k+1},$$ and also $$\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(k+1)(k+2)(2k+3)M_k^23^{n-1-k}=n(n+1)(n+2)M_nM_{n-1}.$$;math.CO
1801.08908;R-matrix-valued Lax pairs and long-range spin chains;In this paper we discuss $R$-matrix-valued Lax pairs for ${\rm sl}_N$ Calogero-Moser model and their relation to integrable quantum long-range spin chains of the Haldane-Shastry-Inozemtsev type. First, we construct the $R$-matrix-valued Lax pairs for the third flow of the classical Calogero-Moser model. Then we notice that the scalar parts (in the auxiliary space) of the $M$-matrices corresponding to the second and third flows have form of special spin exchange operators. The freezing trick restricts them to quantum Hamiltonians of long-range spin chains. We show that for a special choice of the $R$-matrix these Hamiltonians reproduce those for the Inozemtsev chain. In the general case related to the Baxter's elliptic $R$-matrix we obtain a natural anisotropic extension of the Inozemtsev chain. Commutativity of the Hamiltonians is verified numerically. Trigonometric limits lead to the Haldane-Shastry chains and their anisotropic generalizations.;math-ph
1801.08910;The zero forcing polynomial of a graph;Zero forcing is an iterative graph coloring process, where given a set of initially colored vertices, a colored vertex with a single uncolored neighbor causes that neighbor to become colored. A zero forcing set is a set of initially colored vertices which causes the entire graph to eventually become colored. In this paper, we study the counting problem associated with zero forcing. We introduce the zero forcing polynomial of a graph $G$ of order $n$ as the polynomial $\mathcal{Z}(G,x)=\sum_{i=1}^n z(G,i) x^i$, where $z(G,i)$ is the number of zero forcing sets of $G$ of size $i$. We characterize the extremal coefficients of $\mathcal{Z}(G,x)$, derive closed form expressions for the zero forcing polynomials of several families of graphs, and explore various structural properties of $\mathcal{Z}(G,x)$, including multiplicativity, unimodality, and uniqueness.;math.CO
1801.08913;Iterative Refinement of A Modified Lavrentiev Regularization Method for De-convolution of the Discrete Helmholtz Type Differential Filter;We propose and analyze an iterative refinement of a modified Lavrentiev regularization method for deconvolution of the discrete Helmholtz-type differential filter. The modification for the Lavrentiev regularization method exploits the properties of the Helmholtz filter, and we prove that the modification reduces the error bound between the original solution and the approximated solution. Furthermore, we derive an optimal stopping condition on the number of iterations necessary for the regularization. We provide numerical examples demonstrating the benefits of this iterative modified Lavrentiev regularization over a family of Tikhonov regularization methods.;math.NA
1801.08914;Algebraic Hybridization and Static Condensation with Application to Scalable H(div) Preconditioning;We propose an unified algebraic approach for static condensation and hybridization, two popular techniques in finite element discretizations. The algebraic approach is supported by the construction of scalable solvers for problems involving H(div)-spaces discretized by conforming (Raviart-Thomas) elements of arbitrary order. We illustrate through numerical experiments the relative performance of the two (in some sense dual) techniques in comparison with a state-of-the-art parallel solver, ADS, available in the software hypre and MFEM. The superior performance of the hybridization technique is clearly demonstrated with increased benefit for higher order elements.;math.NA
1801.08919;Intervals in the Hales-Jewett theorem;The Hales-Jewett theorem states that for any $m$ and $r$ there exists an $n$ such that any $r$-colouring of the elements of $[m]^n$ contains a monochromatic combinatorial line. We study the structure of the wildcard set $S \subseteq [n]$ which determines this monochromatic line, showing that when $r$ is odd there are $r$-colourings of $[3]^n$ where the wildcard set of a monochromatic line cannot be the union of fewer than $r$ intervals. This is tight, as for $n$ sufficiently large there are always monochromatic lines whose wildcard set is the union of at most $r$ intervals.;math.CO
1801.08921;A Redesigned Benders Decomposition Approach for Large-Scale In-Transit Freight Consolidation Operations;The growth in online shopping and third party logistics has caused a revival of interest in finding optimal solutions to the large scale in-transit freight consolidation problem. Given the shipment date, size, origin, destination, and due dates of multiple shipments distributed over space and time, the problem requires determining when to consolidate some of these shipments into one shipment at an intermediate consolidation point so as to minimize shipping costs while satisfying the due date constraints. In this paper, we develop a mixed-integer programming formulation for a multi-period freight consolidation problem that involves multiple products, suppliers, and potential consolidation points. Benders decomposition is then used to replace a large number of integer freight-consolidation variables by a small number of continuous variables that reduces the size of the problem without impacting optimality. Our results show that Benders decomposition provides a significant scale-up in the performance of the solver. We demonstrate our approach using a large-scale case with more than 27.5 million variables and 9.2 million constraints.;math.OC
1801.08923;Asymptotics of quantum weighted Hurwitz numbers;This work concerns both the semiclassical and zero temperature asymptotics of quantum weighted double Hurwitz numbers. The partition function for quantum weighted double Hurwitz numbers can be interpreted in terms of the energy distri- bution of a quantum Bose gas with vanishing fugacity. We compute the leading semi- classical term of the partition function for three versions of the quantum weighted Hurwitz numbers, as well as lower order semiclassical corrections. The classical limit $\hbar \ra 0$ is shown to reproduce the simple single and double Hurwitz numbers studied by Pandharipande and Okounkov [20,22]. The KP-Toda $\tau$-function that serves as generating function for the quantum Hurwitz numbers is shown to have the $\tau$-function of [20,22] as its leading term in the classical limit, and, with suitable scaling, the same holds for the partition function, the weights and expectations of Hurwitz numbers. We also compute the zero temperature limit $T \ra 0$ of the partition function and quantum weighted Hurwitz numbers. The KP or Toda $\tau$-function serving as generating function for the quantum Hurwitz numbers are shown to give the one for Belyi curves in the zero temperature limit and, with suitable scaling, the same holds true for the partition function, the weights and the expectations of Hurwitz numbers.;math-ph
1801.08931;Talagrand inequality at second order and application to Boolean analysis;This note is concerned with an extension, at second order, of an inequality on the discrete cube $C_n=\{-1,1\}$ (equipped with the uniform measure) due to Talagrand (\cite{TalL1L2}). As an application, the main result of this note is a Theorem in the spirit of a famous result from Kahn, Kalai and Linial (cf. \cite{KKL}) concerning the influence of Boolean functions. The notion of the influence of a couple of coordinates $(i,j)\in\{1,\ldots,n\}^2$ is introduced in section 2 and the following alternative is obtained : for any Boolean function $f\,:\, C_n\to \{0,1\}$, either there exists a coordinate with influence at least of order $(1/n)^{1/(1+\eta)}$, with $\, 0&lt,\eta&lt,1$ (independent of $f$ and $n$) or there exists a couple of coordinates $(i,j)\in\{1,\ldots,n\}^2$ with $i\neq j$, with influence at least of order $(\log n/n)^2$. In section 4, it is shown that this extension of Talagrand inequality can also be obtained, with minor modifications, for the standard Gaussian measure $\gamma_n$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ , the obtained inequality can be of independent interest. The arguments rely on interpolation methods by semigroup together with hypercontractive estimates. At the end of the article, some related open questions are presented.;math.PR
1801.08933;Transfer of A-infinity structures to projective resolutions;We show that an A-infinity algebra structure can be transferred to a projective resolution of the complex underlying any A-infinity algebra. Under certain connectedness assumptions, this transferred structure is unique up to homotopy. In contrast to the classical results on transfer of A-infinity structures along homotopy equivalences, our result is of interest when the ground ring is not a field. We prove an analog for A-infinity module structures, and both transfer results preserve strict units.;math.KT
1801.08934;Limit theorems for the least common multiple of a random set of integers;Let $L_{n}$ be the least common multiple of a random set of integers obtained from $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ by retaining each element with probability $\theta\in (0,1)$ independently of the others. We prove that the process $(\log L_{\lfloor nt\rfloor})_{t\in [0,1]}$, after centering and normalization, converges weakly to a certain Gaussian process that is not Brownian motion. Further results include a strong law of large numbers for $\log L_{n}$ as well as Poisson limit theorems in regimes when $\theta$ depends on $n$ in an appropriate way.;math.PR
1801.08935;Solvable Leibniz algebras with quasi-filiform Lie algebras of maximum length nilradicals;In this paper solvable Leibniz algebras whose nilradical is quasi-filiform Lie algebra of maximum length, are classified. The rigidity of such Leibniz algebras with two-dimensional complemented space to nilradical is proved.;math.RA
1801.08939;Calder&#xf3,n&#x27,s reproducing formulas for the Weinstein $L^2$- multiplier operators;The aim of this work is the study of the Weinstein $L^2$- multiplier operators on $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}_+$ and we give for them Calder\'on's reproducing formulas and best approximation using the theory of Weinstein transform and reproducing kernels.;math.AP
1801.08953;The totally nonnegative part of G/P is a ball;We show that the totally nonnegative part of a partial flag variety (in the sense of Lusztig) is homeomorphic to a closed ball.;math.RT
1801.08956;Canonical diffusions on the pattern spaces of aperiodic Delone sets;We consider pattern spaces of aperiodic and repetitive Delone sets of finite local complexity. These spaces are compact metric spaces and constitute a special class of foliated spaces. We define new Sobolev spaces with respect to the unique invariant measure and prove the existence of the unitary Schr\"odinger semigroup, which in physics terms describe the evolution of phasons. We define and study natural leafwise diffusion processes on these pattern spaces. These processes have Feller, but lack strong Feller and hypercontractivity properties, and heat kernels do not exist. The associated Dirichlet forms are regular, strongly local, irreducible and recurrent, but not strictly local. For harmonic functions we prove new Liouville and Helmholtz-Hodge type theorems.;math.DS
1801.08960;Smoothness of Topological Equivalence on the Half Line for Nonautonomous Systems;We study the differentiability properties of the topological equivalence between a uniformly asymptotically stable linear nonautonomous system and a perturbed system with suitable nonlinearities. For this purpose, we construct a uniformly continuous homeomorphism inspired in the Palmer's one restricted to the positive half line, providing sufficient conditions ensuring its $C^{r}$--smoothness. Additionally, we study the preservation of the uniform stability properties by this homeomorphism.;math.CA
1801.08968;Optimal Regularity of Constant Graphs in Hyperbolic Space;Inspired by [6, 7], we study the boundary regularity of constant curvature hypersurfaces in the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$, which have prescribed asymptotic boundary at infinity. Through constructing the boundary expansions of the solutions, we derive the optimal regularity of the solutions. Moreover, we obtain an equivalent condition that guarantees the smoothness of the solutions.;math.AP
1801.08972;Multiplicity of eigenvalues of cographs;Motivated by the linear time algorithm that locates the eigenvalues of a cograph G [10], we investigate the multiplicity of eigenvalue for \lambda \neq -1,0. For cographs with balanced cotrees we determine explicitly the highest value for the multiplicity.The energy of a graph is defined as the sum of absolute values of the eigenvalues. A graph G on n vertices is said to be borderenergetic if its energy equals the energy of the complete graph Kn. We present families of non-cospectral and borderenergetic cographs.;math.CO
1801.08973;Flagged higher categories;We introduce \emph{flagged $(\infty,n)$-categories} and prove that they are equivalent to Segal sheaves on Joyal's category ${\mathbf\Theta}_n$. As such, flagged $(\infty,n)$-categories provide a model-independent formulation of Segal sheaves. This result generalizes the statement that $n$-groupoid objects in spaces are effective, as we explain and contextualize. Along the way, we establish a useful expression for the univalent-completion of such a Segal sheaf. Finally, we conjecture a characterization of flagged $(\infty,n)$-categories as stacks on $(\infty,n)$-categories that satisfy descent with respect to colimit diagrams that do not generate invertible $i$-morphisms for any $i$.;math.CT
1801.08974;Zeros of random polynomials and its higher derivatives;In this article we study the limiting empirical measure of zeros of higher derivatives for sequences of random polynomials. We show that these measures agree with the limiting empirical measure of zeros of corresponding random polynomials. Various models of random polynomials are considered by introducing randomness through multiplying a factor with a random zero or removing a zero at random for a given sequence of deterministic polynomials. We also obtain similar results for random polynomials whose zeros are given by i.i.d. random variables. As an application, we show that these phenomenon appear for random polynomials whose zeros are given by the 2D Coulomb gas density.;math.PR
1801.08987;On bodies in $\mathbb{R}^5$ with directly congruent projections or sections;Let $K$ and $L$ be two convex bodies in ${\mathbb R^5}$ with countably many diameters, such that their projections onto all $4$ dimensional subspaces containing one fixed diameter are directly congruent. We show that if these projections have no rotational symmetries, and the projections of $K,L$ on certain 3 dimensional subspaces have no symmetries, then $K=\pm L$ up to a translation. We also prove the corresponding result for sections of star bodies.;math.MG
1801.08989;The maximum deviation of the Sine$_&#x3b2,$ counting process;In this paper, we consider the maximum of the $\text{Sine}_\beta$ counting process from its expectation. We show the leading order behavior is consistent with the predictions of log-correlated Gaussian fields, also consistent with work on the imaginary part of the log-characteristic polynomial of random matrices. We do this by a direct analysis of the stochastic sine equation, which gives a description of the continuum limit of the Pr\"ufer phases of a Gaussian $\beta$-ensemble matrix.;math.PR
1801.08990;Existence of Positive Solutions for a Nonlinear Third-order Integral Boundary Value Problem;In this paper, we study the existence of at least one positive solution for a nonlinear third-order two-point boundary value problem with integral condition. By employing the Krasnoselskii's fixed point theorem on cones, the existence results of the problem are established.;math.CA
1801.08994;Rigidity of minimal submanifolds in space forms;In this paper, we consider the rigidity for an $n(\geq 4)$-dimensional submanfolds $M^n$ with parallel mean curvature in the space form ${\mathbb M}^{n+p}_c$ when the integral Ricci curvature of $M$ has some bound. We prove that, if $c+H^2&gt,0$ and $\|\mathrm{Ric}_{-}^\lambda\|_{n/2}&lt, \epsilon(n,c, \lambda, H)$ for $\lambda$ satisfying $ \frac{n-2}{n-1} (c+H^2) &lt, \lambda \le c+H^2$, then $M$ is the totally umbilical sphere $\mathbb{S}^n(\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{c+H^2}})$. Here $H$ is the norm of the parallel mean curvature of $M$, and $\epsilon(n,c,\lambda, H)$ is a positive constant depending only on $n, c,\lambda$ and $H$. This extends some of the earlier work of [15] from pointwise Ricci curvature lower bound to inetgral Ricci curvature lower bound.;math.DG
1801.09000;Singular integrals and Hardy type spaces for the inverse Gauss measure;Let $\gamma_{-1}$ be the absolutely continuous measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ whose density is the reciprocal of a Gaussian and consider the natural weighted Laplacian $\mathcal{A}$ on $L^2(\gamma_{-1})$. In this paper, we prove boundedness and unboundedness results for the purely imaginary powers and the first order Riesz transforms associated with the translated operators $\mathcal{A}+\lambda I$, $\lambda\geq0$, from certain new Hardy-type spaces adapted to $\gamma_{-1}$ to $L^1(\gamma_{-1})$. We also investigate the weak type $(1,1)$ of these operators.;math.FA
1801.09001;Forking independence from the categorical point of view;Forking is a central notion of model theory, generalizing linear independence in vector spaces and algebraic independence in fields. We develop the theory of forking in abstract, category-theoretic terms, for reasons both practical (we require a characterization suitable for work in $\mu$-abstract elementary classes, i.e. accessible categories with all morphisms monomorphisms) and expository (we hope, with this account, to make forking accessible - and useful - to a broader mathematical audience). In particular, we present an axiomatic definition of what we call a stable independence notion on a category and show that this is in fact a purely category-theoretic axiomatization of the properties of model-theoretic forking in a stable first-order theory.;math.LO
1801.09003;Preperiodic points for quadratic polynomials over cyclotomic quadratic fields;Given a number field $K$ and a polynomial $f(z) \in K[z]$ of degree at least 2, one can construct a finite directed graph $G(f,K)$ whose vertices are the $K$-rational preperiodic points for $f$, with an edge $\alpha \to \beta$ if and only if $f(\alpha) = \beta$. Restricting to quadratic polynomials, the dynamical uniform boundedness conjecture of Morton and Silverman suggests that for a given number field $K$, there should only be finitely many isomorphism classes of directed graphs that arise in this way. Poonen has given a conjecturally complete classification of all such directed graphs over $\mathbb{Q}$, while recent work of the author, Faber, and Krumm has provided a detailed study of this question for all quadratic extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$. In this article, we give a conjecturally complete classification like Poonen's, but over the cyclotomic quadratic fields $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-1})$ and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$. The main tools we use are dynamical modular curves and results concerning quadratic points on curves.;math.DS
1801.09010;Pointwise Partial Information Decomposition using the Specificity and Ambiguity Lattices;What are the distinct ways in which a set of predictor variables can provide information about a target variable? When does a variable provide unique information, when do variables share redundant information, and when do variables combine synergistically to provide complementary information? The redundancy lattice from the partial information decomposition of Williams and Beer provided a promising glimpse at the answer to these questions. However, this structure was constructed using a much criticised measure of redundant information, and despite sustained research, no completely satisfactory replacement measure has been proposed. In this paper, we take a different approach, applying the axiomatic derivation of the redundancy lattice to a single realisation from a set of discrete variables. To overcome the difficulty associated with signed pointwise mutual information, we apply this decomposition separately to the unsigned entropic components of pointwise mutual information which we refer to as the specificity and ambiguity. This yields a separate redundancy lattice for each component. Then based upon an operational interpretation of redundancy, we define measures of redundant specificity and ambiguity enabling us to evaluate the partial information atoms in each lattice. These atoms can be recombined to yield the sought-after multivariate information decomposition. We apply this framework to canonical examples from the literature and discuss the results and the various properties of the decomposition. In particular, the pointwise decomposition using specificity and ambiguity satisfies a chain rule over target variables, which provides new insights into the so-called two-bit-copy example.;cs.IT
1801.09012;Linnik&#x27,s problems and maximal entropy methods;We use maximal entropy methods to examine the distribution properties of primitive integer points on spheres and of CM points on the modular surface. The proofs we give are a modern and dynamical interpretation of Linnik's original ideas and follow techniques presented by Einsiedler, Lindenstrauss, Michel and Venkatesh in 2011.;math.DS
1801.09013;Intersections of $&#x3c8,$ classes on Hassett Spaces for genus $0$ with all weights $\frac{1}{2}$;Hassett spaces are moduli spaces of weighted stable pointed curves. In this work, we consider such spaces of curves of genus $0$ with weights all $\frac{1}{2}$. These spaces are interesting as they are isomorphic to $\overline{M}_{0,n}$ but have different universal families and different intersection theory. We develop a closed formula for intersections of $\psi$-classes on such spaces. In our main result, we encode the formula for top intersections in a generating function obtained by applying a differential operator to the Witten-potential.;math.AG
1801.09014;Poincar&#xe9,-Bendixson Theorem for Hybrid Systems;The Poincar\'e-Bendixson theorem plays an important role in the study of the qualitative behavior of dynamical systems on the plane, it describes the structure of limit sets in such systems. We prove a version of the Poincar\'e-Bendixson Theorem for two dimensional hybrid dynamical systems and describe a method for computing the derivative of the Poincar\'e return map, a useful object for the stability analysis of hybrid systems. We also prove a Poincar\'e-Bendixson Theorem for a class of one dimensional hybrid dynamical systems.;math.DS
1801.09018;Random Access Channel Coding in the Finite Blocklength Regime;Consider a random access communication scenario over a channel whose operation is defined for any number of possible transmitters. Inspired by the model recently introduced by Polyanskiy for the Multiple Access Channel (MAC) with a fixed, known number of transmitters, we assume that the channel is invariant to permutations on its inputs, and that all active transmitters employ identical encoders. Unlike Polyanskiy, we consider a scenario where neither the transmitters nor the receiver know which transmitters are active. We refer to this agnostic communication setup as the Random Access Channel, or RAC. Limited feedback is used to ensure that the collection of active transmitters remains fixed during each epoch. The decoder is tasked with determining from the channel output the number of active transmitters $(k)$ and their messages but not which transmitter sent which message. The decoding procedure occurs at a time $n_t$ depending on the decoder's estimate $t$ of the number of active transmitters, thereby achieving a rate that varies with the number of active transmitters. Single-bit feedback at each time $n_i, i \leq t$, enables all transmitters to determine the end of one coding epoch and the start of the next. The central result of this work demonstrates the achievability on a RAC of performance that is first-order optimal for the MAC in operation during each coding epoch. While prior multiple access schemes for a fixed number of transmitters require $2^k - 1$ simultaneous threshold rules, the proposed scheme uses a single threshold rule and achieves the same dispersion.;cs.IT
1801.09020;Auslander&#x27,s Theorem for group coactions on noetherian graded down-up algebras;We prove a version of a theorem of Auslander for finite group coactions on noetherian graded down-up algebras.;math.RA
1801.09021;A Characterization of Guesswork on Swiftly Tilting Curves;Given a collection of strings, each with an associated probability of occurrence, the guesswork of each of them is their position in a list ordered from most likely to least likely, breaking ties arbitrarily. Guesswork is central to several applications in information theory: Average guesswork provides a lower bound on the expected computational cost of a sequential decoder to decode successfully the transmitted message, the complementary cumulative distribution function of guesswork gives the error probability in list decoding, the logarithm of guesswork is the number of bits needed in optimal lossless one-to-one source coding, and guesswork is the number of trials required of an adversary to breach a password protected system in a brute-force attack. In this paper, we consider memoryless string-sources that generate strings consisting of i.i.d. characters drawn from a finite alphabet, and characterize their corresponding guesswork. Our main tool is the tilt operation. We show that the tilt operation on a memoryless string-source parametrizes an exponential family of memoryless string-sources, which we refer to as the tilted family. We provide an operational meaning to the tilted families by proving that two memoryless string-sources result in the same guesswork on all strings of all lengths if and only if their respective categorical distributions belong to the same tilted family. Establishing some general properties of the tilt operation, we generalize the notions of weakly typical set and asymptotic equipartition property to tilted weakly typical sets of different orders. We use this new definition to characterize the large deviations for all atypical strings and characterize the volume of weakly typical sets of different orders. We subsequently build on this characterization to prove large deviation bounds on guesswork and provide an accurate approximation of its PMF.;cs.IT
1801.09022;A Fourier Coefficients Approach to Hausdorff Dimension in the Heisenberg Group;This paper establishes connections between the group-Fourier transform and the geometry of measures in the Heisenberg group. Firstly, it is shown that if the Fourier transform of a compactly supported, finite, Radon measure is square integrable, then the measure must have a square integrable density. If it's Fourier transform is integrable, the the measure must have a continuous density. In addition, an alternative formulation of the Fourier transform on the Heisenberg group is used to show that energies of measures can be computed via integrals on an appropriate frequency space. This in turns opens the possibility of using Fourier methods in the computation of Hausdorff dimension of sets.;math.FA
1801.09029;Adaptive Hybrid Beamforming with Massive Phased Arrays in Macro-Cellular Networks;Hybrid beamforming via large antenna arrays has shown a great potential for increasing data rate in cellular networks by delivering multiple data streams simultaneously. In this paper, several beamforming design algorithms are proposed based on the long-term channel information for macro-cellular environments where the base station is equipped with a massive phased array under per-antenna power constraint. Using an adaptive scheme, beamforming vectors are updated whenever the long-term channel information changes. First, the problem is studied when the base station has a single RF chain (single-beam scenario). Semi-definite relaxation (SDR) with randomization is used to solve the problem. As a second approach, a low-complexity heuristic beam composition algorithm is proposed which performs very close to the upper-bound obtained by SDR. Next, the problem is studied for a generic number of RF chains (multi-beam scenario) where the Gradient Projection method is used to obtain local solutions. Numerical results reveal that using massive antenna arrays with optimized beamforming vectors can lead to 5X network throughput improvement over systems with conventional antennas.;cs.IT
1801.09033;Affine Schubert calculus and double coinvariants;We first define an action of the double coinvariant algebra $DR_n$ on the homology of the affine flag variety $\widetilde{Fl}_n$ in type $A$, and use affine Schubert calculus to prove that it preserves the image of the homology of the rational $(n,m)$-affine Springer fiber $H_*(\tilde{S}_{n,m})\subset H_*(\widetilde{Fl}_n)$ under the pushforward of the inclusion map. In our main result, we define a filtration by $\mathbb{Q}[\mathbf{x}]$-submodules of $DR_n\cong H_*(\tilde{S}_{n,n+1})$ indexed by compositions, whose leading terms are the Garsia-Stanton "descent monomials" in the $y$-variables. We find an explicit presentation of the subquotients as submodules of the single-variable coinvariant algebra $R_n(x)\cong H_*(Fl_n)$, by identifying the leading torus fixed points with a subset $\mathcal{H}\subset S_n$ of the torus fixed points of the regular nilpotent Hessenberg variety, and comparing them to a cell decomposition of $\tilde{S}_{n,n+1}$ due to Goresky, Kottwitz, and MacPherson. We also discover an explicit monomial basis of $DR_n$, and in particular an independent proof of the Haglund-Loehr formula.;math.CO
1801.09040;Oscillations and integrability of the vorticity in the 3D NS flows;In the studies of the Navier-Stokes (NS) regularity problem, it has become increasingly clear that a more realistic path to improved a priori bounds is to try to break away from the scaling of the energy-level estimates in the realm of the blow-up-type arguments (the solution in view is regular/smooth up to the possible blow-up time) rather than to try to improve regularity of arbitrary Leray's weak solutions. The present article is a contribution in this direction, more precisely, it is shown--in the context of an algebraic/polynomial-type blow-up profile of arbitrary degree--that a very weak condition on the vorticity direction field (membership in a local $bmo$ space weighted with arbitrary many logarithms)--suffices to break the energy-level scaling in the bounds on the vorticity. At the same time, the obtained bounds transform a 3D NS criticality scenario depicted by the macro-scale long vortex filaments into a no-singularity scenario.;math.AP
1801.09047;Stationary distribution of the stochastic theta method for nonlinear stochastic differential equations;The existence and uniqueness of the stationary distribution of the numerical solution generated by the stochastic theta method is studied. When the parameter theta takes different values, the requirements on the drift and diffusion coefficients are different. The convergence of the numerical stationary distribution to the true counterpart is investigated. Several numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the theoretical results.;math.NA
1801.09058;Uniqueness and Stability of Optimizers for a Membrane Problem;We investigate a PDE-constrained optimization problem, with an intuitive interpretation in terms of the design of robust membranes made out of an arbitrary number of different materials. We prove existence and uniqueness of solutions for general smooth bounded domains, and derive a symmetry result for radial ones. We strengthen our analysis by proving that, for this particular problem, there are no non-global local optima. When the membrane is made out of two materials, the problem reduces to a shape optimization problem. We lay the preliminary foundation for computable analysis of this type of problem by proving stability of solutions with respect to some of the parameters involved.;math.AP
1801.09059;Duality of Bochner spaces;We construct the generalized Lebesgue--Bochner spaces $L^p(\mu,\varPi)$ for positive measures $\mu$ and for suitable real or complex topological vector spaces $\varPi$ so that for $1&lt,p&lt,+\infty$ and Banachable $\varPi$ with separable topology the strong dual of the classical Bochner space $L^p(\mu,\varPi)$ becomes canonically represented by $L^{p^*}(\mu,\varPi_\sigma')\,$. Hence we need no separability assumption of the norm topology of the strong dual $\varPi_\beta'$ of $\varPi$. For $p=1$ and for suitably restricted positive measures $\mu$ we even get a similar result without any separability of the norm topology of the target space $\varPi$. For positive Radon measures on locally compact topological spaces these results are essentially contained on pages 588--606 in R. E. Edwards' classical Functional Analysis.;math.FA
1801.09060;IRSA Transmission Optimization via Online Learning;In this work, we propose a new learning framework for optimising transmission strategies when irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) MAC protocol is considered. We cast the online optimisation of the MAC protocol design as a multi-arm bandit problem that exploits the IRSA structure in the learning framework. Our learning algorithm quickly learns the optimal transmission strategy, leading to higher rate of successfully received packets with respect to baseline transmission optimizations.;cs.IT
1801.09063;Capacity Theorems for Distributed Index Coding;In index coding, a server broadcasts multiple messages to their respective receivers, each with some side information that can be utilized to reduce the amount of communication from the server. Distributed index coding is an extension of index coding in which the messages are broadcast from multiple servers, each storing different subsets of the messages. In this paper, the optimal tradeoff among the message rates and the server broadcast rates, which is defined formally as the capacity region, is studied for a general distributed index coding problem. Inner and outer bounds on the capacity region are established that have matching sum-rates for all 218 non-isomorphic four-message problems with equal link capacities for all the links from servers to receivers. The proposed inner bound is built on a distributed composite coding scheme that outperforms the existing schemes by incorporating more flexible decoding configurations and enhanced fractional rate allocations into two-stage composite coding, a scheme that was originally introduced for centralized index coding. The proposed outer bound is built on the polymatroidal axioms of entropy, as well as functional dependences such as the $\rm{fd}$-separation introduced by the multi-server nature of the problem. This outer bound utilizes general groupings of servers with different levels of granularity, which allows a natural tradeoff between computational complexity and tightness of the bound, and includes and improves upon all existing outer bounds for distributed index coding. Specific features of the proposed inner and outer bounds are demonstrated through concrete examples with four or five messages.;cs.IT
1801.09068;Theoretical Foundation of the Weighted Laplace Inpainting Problem;Laplace interpolation is a popular approach in image inpainting using partial differential equations. The classic approach considers the Laplace equation with mixed boundary conditions. Recently a more general formulation has been proposed where the differential operator consists of a point-wise convex combination of the Laplacian and the known image data. We provide the first detailed analysis on existence and uniqueness of solutions for the arising mixed boundary value problem. Our approach considers the corresponding weak formulation and aims at using the Theorem of Lax-Milgram to assert the existence of a solution. To this end we have to resort to weighted Sobolev spaces. Our analysis shows that solutions do not exist unconditionally. The weights need some regularity and fulfil certain growth conditions. The results from this work complement findings which were previously only available for a discrete setup.;math.AP
1801.09071;A proof of Comes-Kujawa&#x27,s conjecture;Let $\kappa$ be a commutative ring containing $2^{-1}$. In this paper, we prove the Comes-Kujawa's conjecture on a $\kappa$-basis of cyclotomic oriented Brauer-Clifford supercategory. As a by-product, we prove that the cyclotomic walled Brauer-Clifford superalgebra defined by Comes and Kujawa and ours are isomorphic if $\kappa$ is an algebraically closed field with characteristic not two.;math.QA
1801.09073;Hermite spectral collocation methods for fractional PDEs in unbounded domains;This work is concerned with spectral collocation methods for fractional PDEs in unbounded domains. The method consists of expanding the solution with proper global basis functions and imposing collocation conditions on the Gauss-Hermite points. In this work, two Hermite-type functions are employed to serve as basis functions. Our main task is to find corresponding differentiation matrices which are computed recursively. Two important issues relevant to condition numbers and scaling factors will be discussed. Applications of the spectral collocation methods to multi-term fractional PDEs are also presented. Several numerical examples are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.;math.NA
1801.09074;Modeling of a diffusion with aggregation: rigorous derivation and numerical simulation;In this paper, a diffusion-aggregation equation with delta potential is introduced. Based on the global existence and uniform estimates of solutions to the diffusion-aggregation equation, we also provide the rigorous derivation from a stochastic particle system while introducing an intermediate particle system with smooth interaction potential. The theoretical results are compared to numerical simulations relying on suitable discretization schemes for the microscopic and macroscopic level. In particular, the regime switch where the analytic theory fails is numerically analyzed very carefully and allows for a better understanding of the equation.;math.AP
1801.09075;On Yamada polynomial of spatial graphs obtained by edge replacements;We present formulae for computing the Yamada polynomial of spatial graphs obtained by replacing edges of plane graphs, such as cycle-graphs, theta-graphs, and bouquet-graphs, by spatial parts. As a corollary, it is shown that zeros of Yamada polynomials of some series of spatial graphs are dense in a certain region in the complex plane, described by a system of inequalities. Also, the relation between Yamada polynomial of graphs and the chain polynomial of edge-labelled graphs is obtained.;math.GT
1801.09077;Stability and Uniqueness of Global Solutions to Euler Equations with Exothermic Reaction;We consider the Cauchy problems of a non-strictly hyperbolic system which describes the compressible Euler fluid with exothermic reaction. In this paper a Lyapunov-type functional is constructed for balance laws. By analysis of the flow generated by front tracking method, we prove the well-posedness theorems and present the local features of global solutions.;math.DS
1801.09081;On the image of MRC fibrations of projective manifolds with semi-positive holomorphic sectional curvature;In this paper, we pose several conjectures on structures and images of maximal rationally connected fibrations of smooth projective varieties admitting semi-positive holomorphic sectional curvature. Toward these conjectures, we prove that the numerical dimension of images of such fibrations is zero under the assumption of the abundance conjecture. As an application, we show that any compact Kaehler surface with semi-positive holomorphic sectional curvature is rationally connected, or a complex torus, or a ruled surface over an elliptic curve.;math.DG
1801.09085;On the finite topology of a vector space and the domination problem for families of norms;Let $V$ be a real or complex vector space. The finite topology of $V$ consists of all the subsets $U$ for which the intersection $U \cap F$ is closed in $F$ for every finite-dimensional linear subspace of $V$. It is known that if $V$ has countable dimension, then this topology coincides with the greatest vector space topology and with the greatest locally convex vector space topology. Here, we note that in this case the finite topology is simply the union of all the normed space topologies. <br />In connection to this problem, we characterize the vector spaces on which every family of norms with given cardinality is dominated.;math.GN
1801.09087;Hopf bifurcation in a conceptual climate model with ice-albedo and precipitation-temperature feedbacks;In this paper we analyse a dynamical system based on the so-called KCG (K\"all\'en, Crafoord, Ghil) conceptual climate model. This model describes an evolution of the globally averaged temperature and the average extent of the ice sheets. In the nondimensional form the model is prone to several simplifications facilitating the subsequent analysis. We consider the limiting case of the stationary snow line for which the phase plane can be completely analysed and the type of each stationary point can be determined. One of them can exhibit the Hopf bifurcation for which occurrence we find the sufficient conditions. Those, in turn, have a straightforward physical meaning and indicate that the model predicts internal oscillations of the climate. Using the typical values of model parameters we conclude that the obtained results are in the same ballpark as the conditions on our planet during the quaternary ice ages. Our analysis is a rigorous justification of a generalization of some previous results by KCG and other authors.;math.DS
1801.09090;On Quasimodularity of Some Equivariant Intersection Numbers on the Hilbert Schemes;We observe that certain equivariant intersection numbers of Chern characters of tautological sheaves on Hilbert schemes for suitable circle actions can be computed using the Bloch-Okounkov formula, hence they are related to Gromov-Witten invariants of elliptic curves and its operator formalism in terms of operators on the Fock space.;math.AG
1801.09094;Domain decomposition for quasi-periodic scattering by layered media via robust boundary-integral equations at all frequencies;We develop a non-overlapping domain decomposition method (DDM) for scalar wave scattering by periodic layered media. Our approach relies on robust boundary-integral equation formulations of Robin-to-Robin (RtR) maps throughout the frequency spectrum, including cutoff (or Wood) frequencies. We overcome the obstacle of non-convergent quasi-periodic Green functions at these frequencies by incorporating newly introduced shifted Green functions. Using the latter in the definition of quasi-periodic boundary-integral operators leads to rigorously stable computations of RtR operators. We develop Nystr\"om discretizations of the RtR maps that rely on trigonometric interpolation, singularity resolution, and fast convergent windowed quasi-periodic Green functions. We solve the tridiagonal DDM system via recursive Schur complements and establish rigorously that this procedure is always completed successfully. We present a variety of numerical results concerning Wood frequencies in two and three dimensions as well as large numbers of layers.;math.NA
1801.09099;Recurrence relations for orthogonal polynomials on a triangle;This paper derives sparse recurrence relations between orthogonal polynomials on a triangle and their partial derivatives, which are analogous to recurrence relations for Jacobi polynomials. We derive these recurrences in a systematic fashion by introducing ladder operators that map an orthogonal polynomial to another by incrementing or decrementing its associated parameters by one.;math.CA
1801.09100;Generalized Estimating Equation for the Student-t Distributions;In \cite{KumarS15J2}, it was shown that a generalized maximum likelihood estimation problem on a (canonical) $\alpha$-power-law model ($\mathbb{M}^{(\alpha)}$-family) can be solved by solving a system of linear equations. This was due to an orthogonality relationship between the $\mathbb{M}^{(\alpha)}$-family and a linear family with respect to the relative $\alpha$-entropy (or the $\mathscr{I}_\alpha$-divergence). Relative $\alpha$-entropy is a generalization of the usual relative entropy (or the Kullback-Leibler divergence). $\mathbb{M}^{(\alpha)}$-family is a generalization of the usual exponential family. In this paper, we first generalize the $\mathbb{M}^{(\alpha)}$-family including the multivariate, continuous case and show that the Student-t distributions fall in this family. We then extend the above stated result of \cite{KumarS15J2} to the general $\mathbb{M}^{(\alpha)}$-family. Finally we apply this result to the Student-t distribution and find generalized estimators for its parameters.;math.ST
1801.09104;The 3x3 lemma in the $&#x3a3,$-Maltsev and $&#x3a3,$-protomodular settings. Applications to monoids and quandles;We investigate what is remaining of the 3x3 lemma and of the denormalized 3x3 lemma, respectively valid in a pointed protomodular and in a Maltsev category, in the context of partial pointed protomodular and partial Maltsev categories, relatively to a class ${\Sigma}$ of points. The results apply, among other structures, to monoids, semirings and quandles;math.CT

1801.09109;Spectral and Energy Efficient Wireless Powered IoT Networks: NOMA or TDMA?;Wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs), where multiple energy-limited devices first harvest energy in the downlink and then transmit information in the uplink, have been envisioned as a promising solution for the future Internet-of-Things (IoT). Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been proposed to improve the system spectral efficiency (SE) of the fifth-generation (5G) networks by allowing concurrent transmissions of multiple users in the same spectrum. As such, NOMA has been recently considered for the uplink of WPCNs based IoT networks with a massive number of devices. However, simultaneous transmissions in NOMA may also incur more transmit energy consumption as well as circuit energy consumption in practice which is critical for energy constrained IoT devices. As a result, compared to orthogonal multiple access schemes such as time-division multiple access (TDMA), whether the SE can be improved and/or the total energy consumption can be reduced with NOMA in such a scenario still remains unknown. To answer this question, we first derive the optimal time allocations for maximizing the SE of a TDMA-based WPCN (T-WPCN) and a NOMA-based WPCN (N-WPCN), respectively. Subsequently, we analyze the total energy consumption as well as the maximum SE achieved by these two networks. Surprisingly, it is found that N-WPCN not only consumes more energy, but also is less spectral efficient than T-WPCN. Simulation results verify our theoretical findings and unveil the fundamental performance bottleneck, i.e., "worst user bottleneck problem", in multiuser NOMA systems.;cs.IT
1801.09113;On the Blaschke-Petkantschin Formula and Drury&#x27,s Identity;The Blaschke-Petkantschin formula is a variant of the polar decomposition of the $k$-fold Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb {R}^n$ in terms of the corresponding measures on $k$-dimensional linear subspaces of $\mathbb {R}^n$. We suggest a new elementary proof of this formula and discuss its connection with the celebrated Drury's identity that plays a key role in the study of mapping properties of the Radon-John $k$-plane transforms. We give a new derivation of this identity and provide it with precise information about constant factors and the class of admissible functions.;math.MG
1801.09114;Rellich-Kondrakov embedding of the Laplacian resolvent on the torus;This paper proves that the domain of the Laplacian, $\DEL,$ on a closed Riemannian manifold, $(M,g),$ is compactly embedded in $L^{2} (M) .$ Particularly, the resolvent of the Laplacian, $(\DEL + 1)^{-1},$ is shown to be compactly embedded on the torus.;math.SP
1801.09117;Centralizer fusion systems of central involutions in a finite group with soluble centralizer of involutions;It is a long-standing open problem raised by Starostin to describe all finite groups with soluble centralizers of involutions. One can observe that if the centralizer fusion system of an involution is nilpotent, then the centralizer of that involution is soluble. In this paper, we classify the cases when the centralizer fusion system of a central involution in a finite group whose all involutions have soluble centralizers is a nilpotent fusion system. Indeed, we analyse the case when the solvable radical has odd order and the corresponding factor group is simple.;math.GR
1801.09118;A self adjusting multirate algorithm based on the TR-BDF2 method;We propose a self adjusting multirate method based on the TR-BDF2 solver. The potential advantages of using TR-BDF2 as the key component of a multirate framework are highlighted. A linear stability analysis of the resulting approach is presented and the stability features of the resulting algorithm are analysed. The analysis framework is completely general and allows to study along the same lines the stability of self adjusting multirate methods based on a generic one step solver. A number of numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the resulting approach also the time discretization of hyperbolic partial differential equations.;math.NA
1801.09122;Finite element model updating for structural applications;A novel method for performing model updating on finite element models is presented. The approach is particularly tailored to modal analyses of buildings, by which the lowest frequencies, obtained by using sensors and system identification approaches, need to be matched to the numerical ones predicted by the model. This is done by optimizing some unknown material parameters (such as mass density and Young's modulus) of the materials and/or the boundary conditions, which are often known only approximately. In particular, this is the case when considering historical buildings. <br />The straightforward application of a general-purpose optimizer can be impractical, given the large size of the model involved. In the paper, we show that, by slightly modifying the projection scheme used to compute the eigenvalues at the lowest end of the spectrum one can obtain local parametric reduced order models that, embedded in a trust-region scheme, form the basis for a reliable and efficient specialized algorithm. <br />We describe an optimization strategy based on this approach, and we provide numerical experiments that confirm its effectiveness and accuracy.;math.NA
1801.09125;Scalable Mutual Information Estimation using Dependence Graphs;The Mutual Information (MI) is an often used measure of dependency between two random variables utilized in information theory, statistics and machine learning. Recently several MI estimators have been proposed that can achieve parametric MSE convergence rate. However, most of the previously proposed estimators have the high computational complexity of at least $O(N^2)$. We propose a unified method for empirical non-parametric estimation of general MI function between random vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$ based on $N$ i.i.d. samples. The reduced complexity MI estimator, called the ensemble dependency graph estimator (EDGE), combines randomized locality sensitive hashing (LSH), dependency graphs, and ensemble bias-reduction methods. We prove that EDGE achieves optimal computational complexity $O(N)$, and can achieve the optimal parametric MSE rate of $O(1/N)$ if the density is $d$ times differentiable. To the best of our knowledge EDGE is the first non-parametric MI estimator that can achieve parametric MSE rates with linear time complexity. We illustrate the utility of EDGE for the analysis of the information plane (IP) in deep learning. Using EDGE we shed light on a controversy on whether or not the compression property of information bottleneck (IB) in fact holds for ReLu and other rectification functions in deep neural networks (DNN).;cs.IT
1801.09127;$\mathfrak{X}$-Gorenstein projective dimensions;In this paper, we mainly investigate the $\mathfrak{X}$-Gorenstein projective dimension of modules and the (left) $\mathfrak{X}$-Gorenstein global dimension of rings. Some properties of $\mathfrak{X}$-Gorenstein projective dimensions are obtained. Furthermore, we prove that the (left) $\mathfrak{X}$-Gorenstein global dimension of ring $R$ is equal to the supremum of the set of $\mathfrak{X}$-Gorenstein projective dimensions of all cyclic (left) $R$-modules. This result extends the well-known Auslander's theorem on the global dimension and its Gorenstein homological version.;math.RA
1801.09132;Kesten&#x27,s theorem for uniformly recurrent subgroups;We prove an inequality on the difference between the spectral radius of the Cayley graph of a group $G$ and the spectral radius of the Schreier graph $H\backslash G$ for any subgroup $H$. As an application we extend Kesten's theorem on spectral radii to uniformly recurrent subgroups and give a short proof that the result of Lyons and Peres on cycle density in Ramanujan graphs holds on average. More precisely, we show that if $\mathcal G$ is an infinite deterministic Ramanujan graph, then the time spent in short cycles by a random walk of length $n$ is $o(n)$.;math.GR
1801.09133;Finite groups with two relative subgroup commutativity degrees;In this paper we show that there is an infinite number of finite groups with two relative subgroup commutativity degrees. Also, we indicate a sufficient condition such that a finite group has at least three relative subgroup commutativity degrees and we prove that $D_6$ is the only finite dihedral group with two relative commutativity degrees. Finally, we study the density of the set containing all subgroup commutativity degrees of finite groups.;math.GR
1801.09134;Asymptotic behavior for the principal eigenvalue of a reinforcement problem;In this paper, we consider the asymptotic behavior for the principal eigenvalue of an elliptic operator with piecewise constant coefficients. This problem was first studied by Friedman in 1980. We show how the geometric shape of the interface affects the asymptotic behavior for the principal eigenvalue. This is a refinement of the result by Friedman.;math.SP
1801.09138;Cross-Fitting and Fast Remainder Rates for Semiparametric Estimation;There are many interesting and widely used estimators of a functional with finite semiparametric variance bound that depend on nonparametric estimators of nuisance functions. We use cross-fitting (i.e. sample splitting) to construct novel estimators with fast remainder rates. We give cross-fit doubly robust estimators that use separate subsamples to estimate different nuisance functions. We obtain general, precise results for regression spline estimation of average linear functionals of conditional expectations with a finite semiparametric variance bound. We show that a cross-fit doubly robust spline regression estimator of the expected conditional covariance is semiparametric efficient under minimal conditions. Cross-fit doubly robust estimators of other average linear functionals of a conditional expectation are shown to have the fastest known remainder rates for the Haar basis or under certain smoothness conditions. Surprisingly, the cross-fit plug-in estimator also has nearly the fastest known remainder rate, but the remainder converges to zero slower than the cross-fit doubly robust estimator. As specific examples we consider the expected conditional covariance, mean with randomly missing data, and a weighted average derivative.;math.ST
1801.09139;Vanishing ideals of projective spaces over finite fields and a projective footprint bound;We consider the vanishing ideal of a projective space over a finite field. An explicit set of generators for this ideal has been given by Mercier and Rolland. We show that these generators form a universal Gr\"obner basis of the ideal. Further we give a projective analogue of the footprint bound, and a version of it that is suitable for estimating the number of points of a projective algebraic variety over a finite field. An application to Serre's inequality for the number of rational points of projective hypersurfaces over finite fields is included;math.AG
1801.09140;Zonotopes whose cellular strings are all coherent;A cellular string of a polytope is a sequence of faces stacked on top of each other in a given direction. The poset of cellular strings, ordered by refinement, is known to be homotopy equivalent to a sphere. The subposet of coherent cellular strings is the face lattice of the fiber polytope, hence is homeomorphic to a sphere. In some special cases, every cellular string is coherent. Such polytopes are said to be all-coherent. We give a complete classification of zonotopes with the all-coherence property in terms of their oriented matroid structure. Although the face lattice of the fiber polytope in this case is not an oriented matroid invariant, we prove that the all-coherence property is invariant.;math.CO
1801.09143;On Nano Semi Alpha Open Sets;In this paper, we presented another concept of N-O.S. called NS{\alpha}-O.S. and studied their fundamental properties in nano topological spaces. We also present NS{\alpha}-interior and NS{\alpha}-closure and study some of their fundamental properties.;math.GN
1801.09147;The $q$-unit circle;We define the unit circle for global function fields. We demonstrate that this unit circle (endearingly termed the \emph{$q$-unit circle}, after the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ of $q$ elements) enjoys all of the properties akin to the classical unit circle: center, curvature, roots of unity in completions, integrality conditions, embedding into a finite-dimensional vector space over the real line, a partition of the ambient space into concentric circles, M\"{o}bius transformations, a Dirichlet approximation theorem, a reciprocity law, and much more. We extend the exponential action of Carlitz by polynomials to an action by the real line. We show that mutually tangent horoballs solve a Descartes-type relation arising from reciprocity. We define the hyperbolic plane, which we prove is uniquely determined by the $q$-unit circle. We give the associated modular forms and Eisenstein series.;math.NT
1801.09149;Set Theory and the Analyst;This survey is motivated by specific questions arising in the similarities and contrasts between (Baire) category and (Lebesgue) measure -- category-measure duality and non-duality, as it were. The bulk of the text is devoted to a summary, intended for the working analyst, of the extensive background in set theory and logic needed to discuss such matters: to quote from the Preface of Kelley [Kel]: "what every young analyst should know".;math.CA
1801.09151;Modeling and stabilization of a rotating mechanical system with elastic plates;A mechanical system consisting of a rigid body and attached Kirchhoff plates under the action of three independent controls torques is considered. The equations of motion of such model are derived in the form of a system of coupled nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations. The operator form of this system is represented as an abstract differential equation in a Hilbert space. A feedback control law is constructed such that the corresponding infinitesimal generator is dissipative.;math.OC
1801.09153;Compactness and Comparison;Assuming an abstract comparison principle called the Ultrapower Axiom, which is motivated by the comparison process of inner model theory and generalizes the statement that the Mitchell order is linear on normal ultrafilters, we characterize strongly compact cardinals in terms of supercompactness: a strongly compact cardinal is either supercompact or a limit of supercompact cardinals. Assuming the Ultrapower Axiom and the GCH, we also prove a local result that roughly states that every countably complete ultrafilter factors as a finite iteration of supercompact ultrafilters.;math.LO
1801.09155;A Notion of Total Dual Integrality for Convex, Semidefinite, and Extended Formulations;Total dual integrality is a powerful and unifying concept in polyhedral combinatorics and integer programming that enables the refinement of geometric min-max relations given by linear programming Strong Duality into combinatorial min-max theorems. The definition of total dual integrality (TDI) revolves around the existence of optimal dual solutions that are integral, and thus naturally applies to a host of combinatorial optimization problems that are cast as integer programs whose LP relaxations have the TDIness property. However, when combinatorial problems are formulated using more general convex relaxations, such as semidefinite programs (SDPs), it is not at all clear what an appropriate notion of integrality in the dual program is, thus inhibiting the generalization of the theory to more general forms of structured convex optimization. (In fact, we argue that the rank-one constraint usually added to SDP relaxations is not adequate in the dual SDP.) <br />In this paper, we propose a notion of total dual integrality for SDPs that generalizes the notion for LPs, by relying on an "integrality constraint" for SDPs that is primal-dual symmetric. A key ingredient for the theory is a generalization to compact convex sets of a result of Hoffman for polytopes, fundamental for generalizing the polyhedral notion of total dual integrality introduced by Edmonds and Giles. We study the corresponding theory applied to SDP formulations for stable sets in graphs using the Lov\'asz theta function and show that total dual integrality in this case corresponds to the underlying graph being perfect. We also relate dual integrality of an SDP formulation for the maximum cut problem to bipartite graphs. Total dual integrality for extended formulations naturally comes into play in this context.;math.OC
1801.09160;Infinite products involving Dirichlet characters and cyclotomic polynomials;Using some basic properties of the gamma function, we evaluate a simple class of infinite products involving Dirichlet characters as a finite product of gamma functions and, in the case of odd characters, as a finite product of sines. As a consequence we obtain evaluations of certain multiple $L$-series. In the final part of this paper we derive expressions for infinite products of cyclotomic polynomials, again as finite products of gamma or of sine functions.;math.NT
1801.09164;Another look into the Wong-Zakai Theorem for Stochastic Heat Equation;Consider the heat equation driven by a smooth, Gaussian random potential: \begin{align*} <br />\partial_t u_{\varepsilon}=\tfrac12\Delta u_{\varepsilon}+u_{\varepsilon}(\xi_{\varepsilon}-c_{\varepsilon}), \ \ t&gt,0, x\in\mathbb{R}, \end{align*} where $\xi_{\varepsilon}$ converges to a spacetime white noise, and $c_{\varepsilon} $ is a diverging constant chosen properly. For any $ n\geq 1 $, we prove that $ u_{\varepsilon} $ converges in $ L^n $ to the solution of the stochastic heat equation. Our proof is probabilistic, hence provides another perspective of the general result of Hairer and Pardoux \cite{Hairer15a}, for the special case of the stochastic heat equation. We also discuss the transition from homogenization to stochasticity.;math.PR
1801.09168;Closures in varieties of representations and irreducible components;For any truncated path algebra $\Lambda$ of a quiver, we classify, by way of representation-theoretic invariants, the irreducible components of the parametrizing varieties $\mathbf{Rep}_{\mathbf{d}}(\Lambda)$ of the $\Lambda$-modules with fixed dimension vector $\mathbf{d}$. In this situation, the components of $\mathbf{Rep}_{\mathbf{d}}(\Lambda)$ are always among the closures $\overline{\mathbf{Rep}\,\mathbb{S}}$, where $\mathbb{S}$ traces the semisimple sequences with dimension vector $\mathbf{d}$, and hence the key to the classification problem lies in a characterization of these closures. <br />Our first result concerning closures actually addresses arbitrary basic finite dimensional algebras over an algebraically closed field. In the general case, it corners the closures $\overline{\mathbf{Rep}\,\mathbb{S}}$ by means of module filtrations "governed by $\mathbb{S}$", in case $\Lambda$ is truncated, it pins down the $\overline{\mathbf{Rep}\,\mathbb{S}}$ completely. <br />The analysis of the varieties $\overline{\mathbf{Rep}\,\mathbb{S}}$ leads to a novel upper semicontinuous module invariant which provides an effective tool towards the detection of components of $\mathbf{Rep}_{\mathbf{d}}(\Lambda)$ in general. It detects all components when $\Lambda$ is truncated.;math.RT
1801.09169;Understanding finite dimensional representations generically;We survey the development and status quo of a subject best described as "generic representation theory of finite dimensional algebras", which started taking shape in the early 1980s. Let $\Lambda$ be a finite dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field. Roughly, the theory aims at (a) pinning down the irreducible components of the standard parametrizing varieties for the $\Lambda$-modules with a fixed dimension vector, and (b) assembling generic information on the modules in each individual component, that is, assembling data shared by all modules in a dense open subset of that component. <br />We present an overview of results spanning the spectrum from hereditary algebras through the tame non-hereditary case to wild non-hereditary algebras.;math.RT
1801.09170;Generalized Littlewood-Richardson coefficients for branching rules of GL(n) and extremal weight crystals;Following the methods used by Derksen-Weyman in \cite{DW11} and Chindris in \cite{Chi08}, we use quiver theory to represent the generalized Littlewood-Richardson coefficients for the branching rule for the diagonal embedding of $\gl(n)$ as the dimension of a weight space of semi-invariants. Using this, we prove their saturation and investigate when they are nonzero. We also show that for certain partitions the associated stretched polynomials satisfy the same conjectures as single Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. We then provide a polytopal description of this multiplicity and show that its positivity may be computed in strongly polynomial time. Finally, we remark that similar results hold for certain other generalized Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.;math.RT
1801.09171;Sparse Portfolio Selection via Non-convex Fraction Function;In this paper, a continuous and non-convex promoting sparsity fraction function is studied in two sparse portfolio selection models with and without short-selling constraints. Firstly, we study the properties of the optimal solution to the problem $(FP_{a,\lambda,\eta})$ including the first-order and the second optimality condition and the lower and upper bound of the absolute value for its nonzero entries. Secondly, we develop the thresholding representation theory of the problem $(FP_{a,\lambda,\eta})$. Based on it, we prove the existence of the resolvent operator of gradient of $P_{a}(x)$, calculate its analytic expression, and propose an iterative fraction penalty thresholding (IFPT) algorithm to solve the problem $(FP_{a,\lambda,\eta})$. Moreover, we also prove that the value of the regularization parameter $\lambda&gt,0$ can not be chosen too large. Indeed, there exists $\bar{\lambda}&gt,0$ such that the optimal solution to the problem $(FP_{a,\lambda,\eta})$ is equal to zero for any $\lambda&gt,\bar{\lambda}$. At last, inspired by the thresholding representation theory of the problem $(FP_{a,\lambda,\eta})$, we propose an iterative nonnegative fraction penalty thresholding (INFPT) algorithm to solve the problem $(FP_{a,\lambda,\eta}^{\geq})$. Empirical results show that our methods, for some proper $a&gt,0$, perform effective in finding the sparse portfolio weights with and without short-selling constraints.;math.OC
1801.09172;Modified lp-norm regularization minimization for sparse signal recovery;In numerous substitution models for the $\l_{0}$-norm minimization problem $(P_{0})$, the $\l_{p}$-norm minimization $(P_{p})$ with $0&lt,p&lt,1$ have been considered as the most natural choice. However, the non-convex optimization problem $(P_{p})$ are much more computational challenges, and are also NP-hard. Meanwhile, the algorithms corresponding to the proximal mapping of the regularization $\l_{p}$-norm minimization $(P_{p}^{\lambda})$ are limited to few specific values of parameter $p$. In this paper, we replace the $\ell_{p}$-norm $\|x\|_{p}^{p}$ with a modified function $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{|x_{i}|}{(|x_{i}|+\epsilon_{i})^{1-p}}$. With change the parameter $\epsilon&gt,0$, this modified function would like to interpolate the $\l_{p}$-norm $\|x\|_{p}^{p}$. By this transformation, we translated the $\l_{p}$-norm regularization minimization $(P_{p}^{\lambda})$ into a modified $\l_{p}$-norm regularization minimization $(P_{p}^{\lambda,\epsilon})$. Then, we develop the thresholding representation theory of the problem $(P_{p}^{\lambda,\epsilon})$, and based on it, the IT algorithm is proposed to solve the problem $(P_{p}^{\lambda,\epsilon})$ for all $0&lt,p&lt,1$. Indeed, we could get some much better results by choosing proper $p$, which is one of the advantages for our algorithm compared with other methods. Numerical results also show that, for some proper $p$, our algorithm performs the best in some sparse signal recovery problems compared with some state-of-art methods.;math.OC
1801.09174;Integrating Ultra-Fast Charging Stations within the Power Grids of Smart Cities: A Review;Plug-In Electric Vehicles (PEV) have become a key factor driving towards smart cities, which allow for higher energy efficiency and lower environmental impact across urban sectors. Industry vision for future PEV includes the ability to recharge a vehicle at a speed comparable to traditional gas refueling, i.e., less than $3$ minutes per vehicle. Such a technology, referred to as Ultra-Fast Charging (UFC), has drawn much interest from research and industry. The large power density, impulsive, and stochastic loading characteristics of UFC, however, pose unprecedented challenges to existing electricity supply infrastructure. Planning the locations and electric capacities of these UFC stations is critical to preventing detrimental impacts, including grid asset depreciation, grid instabilities, and deteriorated power quality. In this paper, we first review planning methods for conventional charging stations and then discuss outlooks for UFC planning solutions by drawing an analogy with renewable energy source planning, which presents similar power density and stochastic characteristics as UFC. While this paper mainly focuses on UFC planning from the power grid perspective, other urban aspects, including traffic flow and end-user behavior, are examined for feasible UFC integration within smart cities.;math.OC
1801.09177;A Comparison of SC-FDE and UW DFT-s-OFDM for Millimeter Wave Communications;In this study, we compare the single-carrier (SC) waveform adopted in IEEE 802.11ad and unique word discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (UW DFT-s-OFDM) waveform. We provide equivalent representations of up-sampling and down-sampling operations of the SC waveform by using discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and inverse DFT to enable explicit comparison of these two similar waveforms. By using this representation, we discuss why the IEEE 802.11ad SC waveform can cause suboptimal performance in multipath channel and discuss how to improve it with UW DFT-s-OFDM. With comprehensive link-level simulations, we show that replacing the 802.11ad SC waveform with UW DFT-spread OFDM can result in 1 dB gain in peak throughput without affecting the IEEE 802.11ad packet structure. We also evaluate the cross links where the transmitter is UW-DFT-s-OFDM and the receiver is traditional SC-FDE or vice versa. We demonstrate that UW DFT-s-OFDM receiver can decode an IEEE 802.11ad SC waveform with a slight SNR loss while IEEE 802.11ad SC receiver can decode a UW DFT-spread OFDM waveform with an interference floor.;cs.IT
1801.09178;On the Dynamics of a Rolling Ball Actuated by Internal Point Masses;The motion of a rolling ball actuated by internal point masses that move inside the ball's frame of reference is considered. The equations of motion are derived by applying Euler-Poincar\'e's symmetry reduction method in concert with Lagrange-d'Alembert's principle, which accounts for the presence of the nonholonomic rolling constraint. As a particular example, we consider the case when the masses move along internal rails, or trajectories, of arbitrary shape and fixed within the ball's frame of reference. Our system of equations can treat most possible methods of actuating the rolling ball with internal moving masses encountered in the literature, such as circular motion of the masses mimicking swinging pendula or straight line motion of the masses mimicking magnets sliding inside linear tubes embedded within a solenoid. Moreover, our method can model arbitrary rail shapes and an arbitrary number of rails such as several ellipses and/or figure eights, which may be important for future designs of rolling ball robots. For further analytical study, we also reduce the system to a single differential equation when the motion is planar, that is, considering the motion of the rolling disk actuated by internal point masses, in which case we show that the results obtained from the variational derivation coincide with those obtained from Newton's second law. Finally, the equations of motion are solved numerically, illustrating a wealth of complex behaviors exhibited by the system's dynamics. Our results are relevant to the dynamics of nonholonomic systems containing internal degrees of freedom and to further studies of control of such systems actuated by internal masses.;math.DS
1801.09179;Hindman-like theorems with uncountably many colours and finite monochromatic sets;A particular case of the Hindman--Galvin--Glazer theorem states that, for every partition of an infinite abelian group $G$ into two cells, there will be an infinite $X\subseteq G$ such that the set of its finite sums $\{x_1+\cdots+x_n\big|n\in\mathbb N\wedge x_1,\ldots,x_n\in X\text{ are distinct}\}$ is monochromatic. It is known that the same statement is false, in a very strong sense, if one attempts to obtain an uncountable (rather than just infinite) $X$. On the other hand, a recent result of Komj\'ath states that, for partitions into uncountably many cells, it is possible to obtain monochromatic sets of the form $\mathrm{FS}(X)$, for $X$ of some prescribed finite size, when working with sufficiently large Boolean groups. In this paper, we provide a generalization of Komj\'ath's result, and we show that, in a sense, this generalization is the strongest possible.;math.LO
1801.09181;Generalized Lambert series, Raabe&#x27,s integral and a two-parameter generalization of Ramanujan&#x27,s formula for $&#x3b6,(2m+1)$;A comprehensive study of the generalized Lambert series $\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{n^{N-2h}\exp{(-an^{N}x)}}{1-\exp{(-n^{N}x)}}, 0&lt,a\leq 1,\ x&gt,0$, $N\in\mathbb{N}$ and $h\in\mathbb{Z}$, is undertaken. Two of the general transformations of this series that we obtain here lead to two-parameter generalizations of Ramanujan's famous formula for $\zeta(2m+1)$, $m&gt,0$ and the transformation formula for $\log\eta(z)$. Numerous important special cases of our transformations are derived. An identity relating $\zeta(2N+1), \zeta(4N+1),\cdots, \zeta(2Nm+1)$ is obtained for $N$ odd and $m\in\mathbb{N}$. Certain transcendence results of Zudilin- and Rivoal-type are obtained for odd zeta values and generalized Lambert series. A criterion for transcendence of $\zeta(2m+1)$ and a Zudilin-type result on irrationality of Euler's constant $\gamma$ are also given. New results analogous to those of Ramanujan and Klusch for $N$ even, and a transcendence result involving $\zeta\left(2m+1-\frac{1}{N}\right)$, are obtained.;math.NT
1801.09187;A model of Josephson Junctions on Boson Systems - Currents and Entropy Production Rate -;Non-equilibrium steady states (NESS), in the sense of D. Ruelle, of Boson systems with Bose--Einstein condensation (BEC) are investigated with the aid of the C^*-algebraic method. The model consists of a quantum particle and several bosonic reservoirs. We show that the mean entropy production rate is strictly positive, independent of phase differences provided that the temperatures or the chemical potentials of reservoirs are different. Moreover, Josephson currents occur without entropy production, if the temperatures and the chemical potentials of reservoirs are identical.;math-ph
1801.09188;On the quasisymmetric minimality of homogeneous perfect sets;Z. Wen and J. Wu introduced the notion of homogeneous perfect sets as a generalization of Cantor type sets and determined their exact Hausdorff dimension based on the length of their fundamental intervals and the gaps between them. In this paper, we considered the minimality of the homogeneous perfect sets with Hausdorff dimension 1 and proved they are 1-dimensional quasisymmetrically minimal under some conditions.;math.MG
1801.09190;A Stable Weak Galerkin Finite Element Method for Stokes Problem;We study the weak Galerkin finite element method for Stokes problem. A new weak Galerkin finite element velocity-pressure space pair is presented which satisfies the discrete inf-sup condition. Based on this space pair, we establish a stable weak Galerkin approximation scheme without adding any stability term or penalty term. Then, we further derive the optimal error estimates for velocity and pressure approximations, respectively. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the theoretical analysis.;math.NA
1801.09191;On projective varieties with strictly nef tangent bundles;In this paper, we study smooth complex projective varieties $X$ such that some exterior power $\bigwedge^r T_X$ of the tangent bundle is strictly nef. We prove that such varieties are rationally connected. We also classify the following two cases. If $T_X$ is strictly nef, then $X$ isomorphic to the projective space $\mathrm{P}^n$. If $\bigwedge^2 T_X$ is strictly nef and if $X$ has dimension at least $3$, then $X$ is either isomorphic to $\mathrm{P}^n$ or a quadric $\mathrm{Q}^n$.;math.AG
1801.09194;A Gale-Berlekamp permutation-switching problem in higher dimensions;Let an $n\times n$ array $\left( a_{ij}\right) $ of lights be given, each either on (when $a_{ij}=1$) or off (when $a_{ij}=-1$). For each row and each column there is a switch so that if the switch is pulled ($x_{i}=-1$ for row $i$ and $y_{j}=-1$ for column $j$) all of the lights in that line are switched: on to off or off to on. The unbalancing lights problem (Gale-Berlekamp switching game) consists in maximizing the difference between the lights on and off. We obtain the exact parameters for a generalization of the unbalancing lights problem in higher dimensions.;math.CO

Ordering of the return words to $w$ in this concatenation is coded by derivated word $d_{\bf u}(w)$. In 1998, Durand proved that a fixed point ${\bf u}$ of a primitive morphism has only finitely many derivated words $d_{\bf u}(w)$ and each derivated word $d_{\bf u}(w)$ is fixed by a primitive morphism as well. In our article we focus on Sturmian words fixed by a primitive morphism. We provide an algorithm which to a given Sturmian morphism $\psi$ lists the morphisms fixing the derivated words of the Sturmian word ${\bf u} = \psi({\bf u})$. We provide a sharp upper bound on length of the list.;math.CO
1801.09206;Finite Groups Having Nonnormal T.I. Subgroups;In the present paper, the structure of a finite group $G$ having a nonnormal T.I. subgroup $H$ which is also a Hall $\pi$-subgroup is studied. As a generalization of a result due to Gow, we prove that $H$ is a Frobenius complement whenever $G$ is $\pi$-separable. This is achieved by obtaining the fact that Hall T.I. subgroups are conjugate in a finite group. We also prove two theorems about normal complements one of which generalizes a classical result of Frobenius.;math.GR
1801.09209;Nash inequality for Diffusion Processes Associated with Dirichlet Distributions;For any $N\ge 2$ and $\alpha=(\alpha_1,\cdots, \alpha_{N+1})\in (0,\infty)^{N+1}$, let $\mu^{(N)}_{\alpha}$ be the Dirichlet distribution with parameter $\alpha$ on the set $\Delta^{ (N)}:= \{ x \in [0,1]^N:\ \sum_{1\le i\le N}x_i \le 1 \}.$ The multivariate Dirichlet diffusion is associated with the Dirichlet form <br />$${\scr E}_\alpha^{(N)}(f,f):= \sum_{n=1}^N \int_{ \Delta^{(N)}} \bigg(1-\sum_{1\le i\le N}x_i\bigg) x_n(\partial_n f)^2(x)\,\mu^{(N)}_\alpha(d x)$$ with Domain ${\scr D}({\scr E}_\alpha^{(N)})$ being the closure of $C^1(\Delta^{(N)})$. We prove the Nash inequality <br />$$\mu_\alpha^{(N)}(f^2)\le C {\scr E}_\alpha^{(N)}(f,f)^{\frac p{p+1} }\mu_\alpha^{(N)} (|f|)^{\frac 2 {p+1}},\ \ f\in {\scr D}({\scr E}_\alpha^{(N)}), \mu_\alpha^{(N)}(f)=0$$ for some constant $C&gt,0$ and <br />$p= (\alpha_{N+1}-1)^+ +\sum_{i=1}^N 1\lor (2\alpha_i),$ where the constant $p$ is sharp when $\max_{1\le i\le N} \alpha_i \le 1/2$ and $\alpha_{N+1}\ge 1$. This Nash inequality also holds for the corresponding Fleming-Viot process.;math.PR
1801.09211;Exact expansions of Hankel transforms and related integrals;The Hankel transform H_n[f(x)](q) = int_0^infinity xf(x)J_n(qx)dx is studied for integer n&gt,=-1 and positive parameter q. It is proved that the Hankel transform is given by uniformly and absolutely convergent series in reciprocal powers of q, provided special conditions on the function f(x) and its derivatives are imposed. It is necessary to underline that similar formulas obtained previously are in fact asymptotic expansions only valid when q tends to infinity. If one of the conditions is violated, our series become asymptotic series. The validity of the formulas is illustrated by a number of examples.;math.CA
1801.09213;Fr&#xe9,chet differentiability in Fr&#xe9,chet spaces, and differential equations with unbounded variable delay;We introduce and discuss Fr\'echet differentiability for maps between Fr\'echet spaces. For delay differential equations $x'(t)=f(x_t)$ we construct a continuous semiflow of continuously differentiable solution operators $x_0\mapsto x_t$, $t\ge0$, on submanifolds of the Fr\'echet space $C^1((-\infty,0],\mathbb{R}^n)$, and establish local invariant manifolds at stationary points by means of transversality and embedding properties. The results apply to examples with unbounded but locally bounded delay.;math.DS
1801.09214;Delay differential equations with differentiable solution operators on open domains in $C((-\infty,0],\mathbb{R}^n)$, and processes for Volterra integro-differential equations;For autonomous delay differential equations $x'(t)=f(x_t)$ we construct a continuous semiflow of continuously differentiable solution operators $x_0\mapsto x_t$, $t\ge0$, on open subsets of the Fr\'echet space $C((-\infty,0],\mathbb{R}^n)$. For nonautonomous equations this yields a continuous process of differentiable solution operators. As an application we obtain processes which incorporate all solutions of Volterra integro-differential equations $x'(t)=\int_0^tk(t,s)h(x(s))ds$;math.DS
1801.09219;The Zarankiewicz problem in 3-partite graphs;Let $F$ be a graph, $k \geq 2$ be an integer, and write $\mathrm{ex}_{ \chi \leq k } (n , F)$ for the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph that is $k$-partite and has no subgraph isomorphic to $F$. The function $\mathrm{ex}_{ \chi \leq 2} ( n , F)$ has been studied by many researchers. Finding $\mathrm{ex}_{ \chi \leq 2} (n , K_{s,t})$ is a special case of the Zarankiewicz problem. We prove an analogue of the K\"{o}v\'{a}ri-S\'{o}s-Tur\'{a}n Theorem for 3-partite graphs by showing \[ \mathrm{ex}_{ \chi \leq 3} (n , K_{s,t} ) \leq \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{1 - 1/s} \left( \frac{ t - 1}{2} + o(1) \right)^{1/s} n^{2 - 1/s} \] for $2 \leq s \leq t$. Using Sidon sets constructed by Bose and Chowla, we prove that this upper bound is asymptotically best possible in the case that $s = 2$ and $t \geq 3$ is odd, i.e., $\mathrm{ex}_{ \chi \leq 3} ( n , K_{2,2t+1} ) = \sqrt{ \frac{t}{3}} n^{3/2} + o(n^{3/2})$ for $t \geq 1$. In the cases of $K_{2,t}$ and $K_{3,3}$, we use a result of Allen, Keevash, Sudakov, and Verstra\"{e}te, to show that a similar upper bound holds for all $k \geq 3$, and gives a better constant when $s=t=3$. Lastly, we point out an interesting <br />connection between difference families from design theory and $\mathrm{ex}_{ \chi \leq 3 } (n ,C_4)$.;math.CO
1801.09220;The Methods of Layer Potentials for General Elliptic Homogenization Problems in Lipschitz Domains;In terms of layer potential methods, this paper is devoted to study the $L^2$ boundary value problems for nonhomogeneous elliptic operators with rapidly oscillating coefficients in a periodic setting. Under a low regularity assumption on the coefficients, we establish the solvability for Dirichlet, regular and Neumann problems in a bounded Lipschitz domain, as well as, the uniform nontangential maximal function estimates and square function estimates. The main difficulty is reflected in two aspects: (i) we can not treat the lower order terms as a compact perturbation to the leading term due to the low regularity assumption, (ii) the nonhomogeneous systems do not possess a scaling-invariant property in general. Although this work may be regarded as a follow-up to C. Kenig and Z. Shen's in \cite{SZW24}, we make an effort to find a clear way of how to handle the nonhomogeneous operators by using the known results of the homogenous ones. Also, we mention that the periodicity condition plays a key role in the scaling-invariant estimates.;math.AP
1801.09223;Probability Mass Exclusions and the Directed Components of Pointwise Mutual Information;This paper examines how an event from one random variable provides pointwise mutual information about an event from another variable via probability mass exclusions. We start by introducing probability mass diagrams, which provide a visual representation of how a prior distribution is transformed to a posterior distribution through exclusions. With the aid of these diagrams, we identify two distinct types of probability mass exclusions---namely informative and misinformative exclusions. Then, motivated by Fano's derivation of the pointwise mutual information, we propose four postulates which aim to decompose the pointwise mutual information into two separate informational components: a non-negative term associated with the informative exclusion and a non-positive term associated with the misinformative exclusions. This yields a novel derivation of a familiar decomposition of the pointwise mutual information into entropic components. We conclude by discussing the relevance of considering information in terms of probability mass exclusions to the ongoing effort to decompose multivariate information.;cs.IT
1801.09234;On $&#x3c3,$-quasinormal subgroups of finite groups;Let $G$ be a finite group and $\sigma =\{\sigma_{i} | i\in I\}$ some partition of the set of all primes $\Bbb{P}$, that is, $\sigma =\{\sigma_{i} | i\in I \}$, where $\Bbb{P}=\bigcup_{i\in I} \sigma_{i}$ and $\sigma_{i}\cap \sigma_{j}= \emptyset $ for all $i\ne j$. We say that $G$ is $\sigma$-primary if $G$ is a $\sigma _{i}$-group for some $i$. A subgroup $A$ of $G$ is said to be: ${\sigma}$-subnormal in $G$ if there is a subgroup chain $A=A_{0} \leq A_{1} \leq \cdots \leq A_{n}=G$ such that either $A_{i-1}\trianglelefteq A_{i}$ or $A_{i}/(A_{i-1})_{A_{i}}$ is $\sigma$-primary for all $i=1, \ldots, n$, modular in $G$ if the following conditions hold: (i) $\langle X, A \cap Z \rangle=\langle X, A \rangle \cap Z$ for all $X \leq G, Z \leq G$ such that $X \leq Z$, and (ii) $\langle A, Y \cap Z \rangle=\langle A, Y \rangle \cap Z$ for all $Y \leq G, Z \leq G$ such that $A \leq Z$. In this paper, a subgroup $A$ of $G$ is called $\sigma$-quasinormal in $G$ if $L$ is modular and ${\sigma}$-subnormal in $G$. We study $\sigma$-quasinormal subgroups of $G$. In particular, we prove that if a subgroup $H$ of $G$ is $\sigma$-quasinormal in $G$, then for every chief factor $H/K$ of $G$ between $H^{G}$ and $H_{G}$ the semidirect product $(H/K)\rtimes (G/C_{G}(H/K))$ is $\sigma$-primary.;math.GR
1801.09235;On one generalization of finite nilpotent groups;Let $\sigma =\{\sigma_{i} | i\in I\}$ be a partition of the set $\Bbb{P}$ of all primes and $G$ a finite group. A chief factor $H/K$ of $G$ is said to be $\sigma$-central if the semidirect product $(H/K)\rtimes (G/C_{G}(H/K))$ is a $\sigma_{i}$-group for some $i=i(H/K)$. $G$ is called $\sigma$-nilpotent if every chief factor of $G$ is $\sigma$-central. We say that $G$ is semi-${\sigma}$-nilpotent (respectively weakly semi-${\sigma}$-nilpotent) if the normalizer $N_{G}(A)$ of every non-normal (respectively every non-subnormal) $\sigma$-nilpotent subgroup $A$ of $G$ is $\sigma$-nilpotent. In this paper we determine the structure of finite semi-${\sigma}$-nilpotent and weakly semi-${\sigma}$-nilpotent groups.;math.GR
1801.09237;A Balian-Low Theorem for Subspaces;We extend the Balian-Low theorem to Gabor subspaces of $L^2(\mathbb R)$ by involving the concept of additional time-frequency shift invariance. We prove that if a Gabor system on a lattice of rational density is a Riesz sequence generating a subspace which is invariant under an additional time-frequency shift, then its generator cannot decay fast simultaneously in time and frequency.;math.FA
1801.09239;Vector fields on $\mathfrak{osp}_{2m-1|2n}(\mathbb C)$-flag supermanifolds;We compute the Lie superalgebras of holomorphic vector fields on isotropic flag supermanifolds of maximal type corresponding to the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}_{2m-1|2n}(\mathbb C)$.;math.RT
1801.09241;Virtually abelian subgroups of $IA_n(Z/3)$ are abelian;When studying subgroups of $Out(F_n)$, one often replaces a given subgroup $H$ with one of its finite index subgroups $H_0$ so that virtual properties of $H$ become actual properties of $H_0$. In many cases, the finite index subgroup is $H_0 = H \cap IA_n(Z/3)$. For which properties is this a good choice? Our main theorem states that being abelian is such a property. Namely, every virtually abelian subgroup of $IA_n(Z/3)$ is abelian.;math.GR
1801.09243;Motivic Intersection Complex of Certain Shimura varieties;Using a version of weight conservativity we demonstrate that for certain Shimura varieties (including all Shimura three-folds, most Shimura four-folds and the Siegel sixfold) the construction of the motivic intersection complex due to Wildeshaus compares with a motivic weight truncation in the sense of S. Morel. In particular it is defined up to a unique isomorphism, and satisfies the intrinsic characterization for an intermediate extension due to Wildeshaus.;math.AG
1801.09244;A periodic solution of period two of a delay differential equation;In this paper we prove that the following delay differential equation \[ \frac{d}{dt}x(t)=rx(t)\left(1-\int_{0}^{1}x(t-s)ds\right), \] has a periodic solution of period two for $r&gt,\frac{\pi^{2}}{2}$ (when the steady state, $x=1$, is unstable). In order to find the periodic solution, we study an integrable system of ordinary differential equations, following the idea by Kaplan and Yorke \cite{Kaplan=000026Yorke:1974}. The periodic solution is expressed in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions.;math.DS
1801.09245;Wavelet Analysis of the Besov Regularity of L&#xe9,vy White Noises;We characterize the local smoothness and the asymptotic growth rate of the L\'evy white noise. We do so by characterizing the weighted Besov spaces in which it is located. We extend known results in two ways. First, we obtain new bounds for the local smoothness via the Blumenthal-Getoor indices of the L\'evy white noise. We also deduce the critical local smoothness when the two indices coincide, which is true for symmetric-alpha-stable, compound Poisson, and symmetric-gamma white noises to name a few. Second, we express the critical asymptotic growth rate in terms of the moment properties of the L\'evy white noise. Previous analyses only provided lower bounds for both the local smoothness and the asymptotic growth rate. Showing the sharpness of these bounds requires us to determine in which Besov spaces a given L\'evy white noise is (almost surely) not. Our methods are based on the wavelet-domain characterization of Besov spaces and precise moment estimates for the wavelet coefficients of the L\'evy white noise.;math.PR
1801.09246;Topological properties of convolutor spaces via the short-time Fourier transform;We discuss the structural and topological properties of a general class of weighted $L^1$ convolutor spaces. Our theory simultaneously applies to weighted $\mathcal{D}'_{L^1}$ spaces as well as to convolutor spaces of the Gelfand-Shilov spaces $\mathcal{K}\{M_p\}$. In particular, we characterize the sequences of weight functions $(M_p)_{p \in \mathbb{N}}$ for which the space of convolutors of $\mathcal{K}\{M_p\}$ is ultrabornological, thereby generalizing Grothendieck's classical result for the space $\mathcal{O}'_{C}$ of rapidly decreasing distributions. Our methods lead to the first direct proof of the completeness of the space $\mathcal{O}_{C}$ of very slowly increasing smooth functions.;math.FA

1801.09252;End to End Performance Analysis of Relay Cooperative Communication Based on Parked Cars;Parking lots (PLs) are usually full with cars. If these cars are formed into a self-organizing vehicular network, they can be new kind of road side units (RSUs) in urban area to provide communication data forwarding between mobile terminals nearby and a base station. However cars in PLs can leave at any time, which is neglected in the existing studies. In this paper, we investigate relay cooperative communication based on parked cars in PLs. Taking the impact of the car's leaving behavior into consideration, we derive the expressions of outage probability in a two-hop cooperative communication and its link capacity. Finally, the numerical results show that the impact of a car's arriving time is greater than the impact of the duration the car has parked on outage probability.;cs.IT
1801.09256;Study on Energy Consumption and Coverage of Hierarchical Cooperation of Small Cell Base Stations in Heterogeneous Networks;The demand for communication services in the era of intelligent terminals is unprecedented and huge. To meet such development, modern wireless communications must provide higher quality services with higher energy efficiency in terms of system capacity and quality of service (QoS), which could be achieved by the high-speed data rate, the wider coverage and the higher band utilization. In this paper, we propose a way to offload users from a macro base station(MBS) with a hierarchical distribution of small cell base stations(SBS). The connection probability is the key indicator of the implementation of the unload operation. Furthermore, we measure the service performance of the system by finding the conditional probability-coverage probability with the certain SNR threshold as the condition, that is, the probability of obtaining the minimum communication quality when the different base stations are connected to the user. Then, user-centered total energy consumption of the system is respectively obtained when the macro base station(MBS) and the small cell base stations(SBS) serve each of the users. The simulation results show that the hierarchical SBS cooperation in heterogeneous networks can provide a higher system total coverage probability for the system with a lower overall system energy consumption than MBS.;cs.IT
1801.09265;The weakly dependent strong law of large numbers revisited;We give a short, self-contained, and elementary proof of the strong law of large numbers under a power law decay hypothesis for joint second moments. The result is related to the classical one by Lyons. However, we also provide a rate of convergence. Our proof does not use maximal inequalities and is instead inspired by the method of multiscale large versus small field decompositions in constructive quantum field theory.;math.PR
1801.09266;Reducible subgroups of exceptional algebraic groups;Let $G$ be a simple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field. A closed subgroup $H$ of $G$ is called $G$-completely reducible ($G$-cr) if, whenever $H$ is contained in a parabolic subgroup $P$ of $G$, it is contained in a Levi factor of $P$. In this paper we complete the classification of connected $G$-cr subgroups when $G$ has exceptional type, by determining the $L_{0}$-irreducible connected reductive subgroups for each simple classical factor $L_{0}$ of a Levi subgroup of $G$. As an illustration, we determine all reducible, $G$-cr semisimple subgroups when $G$ has type $F_4$ and various properties thereof. This work complements results of Lawther, Liebeck, Seitz and Testerman, and is vital in classifying non-$G$-cr reductive subgroups, a project being undertaken by the authors elsewhere.;math.GR

1801.09269;Wasserstein Riemannian Geometry of Positive Definite Matrices;The Wasserstein distance on multivariate non-degenerate Gaussian densities is a Riemannian distance. After reviewing the properties of the distance and the metric geodesic, we present an explicit form of the Riemannian metrics on positive-definite matrices and compute its tensor form with respect to the trace inner product. The tensor is a matrix which is the solution to a Lyapunov equation. We compute the explicit formula for the Riemannian exponential, the normal coordinates charts and the Riemannian gradient. Finally, the Levi-Civita covariant derivative is computed in matrix form together with the differential equation for the parallel transport. While all computations are given in matrix form, nonetheless we discuss also the use of a special moving frame.;math.ST
1801.09270;Duality and mapping tori in Heegaard Floer homology;We show that the graph TQFT for Heegaard Floer homology satisfies a strong version of Atiyah's duality axiom for a TQFT. As an application, we compute some Heegaard Floer mixed invariants of 4-dimensional mapping tori in terms of Lefschetz numbers on $HF^+$.;math.GT
1801.09276;Uniqueness of the blow-up at isolated singularities for the Alt-Caffarelli functional;In this paper we prove uniqueness of blow-ups and $C^{1,\log}$-regularity for the free-boundary of minimizers of the Alt-Caffarelli functional at points where one blow-up has an isolated singularity. We do this by establishing a (log-)epiperimetric inequality for the Weiss energy for traces close to that of a cone with isolated singularity, whose free-boundary is graphical and smooth over that of the cone in the sphere. With additional assumptions on the cone, we can prove a classical epiperimetric inequality which can be applied to deduce a $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity result. We also show that these additional assumptions are satisfied by the De Silva-Jerison-type cones, which are the only known examples of minimizing cones with isolated singularity. Our approach draws a connection between epiperimetric inequalities and the \L ojasiewicz inequality, and, to our knowledge, provides the first regularity result at singular points in the one-phase Bernoulli problem.;math.AP
1801.09279;Topological Poincar&#xe9, type inequalities and lower bounds on the infimum of the spectrum for graphs;We study topological Poincar\'e type inequalities on general graphs. We characterize graphs satisfying such inequalities and then turn to the best constants in these inequalities. Invoking suitable metrics we can interpret these constants geometrically as diameters and inradii. Moreover, we can relate them to spectral theory of Laplacians once a probability measure on the graph is chosen. More specifically, we obtain a variational characterization of these constants as infimum over spectral gaps of all Laplacians on the graphs associated to probability measures.;math.FA
1801.09282;Spectral Shape Preserving Approximation;We introduce an algorithm of joint approximation of a function and its first derivative by alternative orthogonal polynomials on the interval [0,1].The algorithm exhibits properties of shape preserving approximation for the function. A weak formulation of approximation is presented. An example on shape preserving extrapolation is given. The weak form is reduced for approximation on a discrete set of abscissas. <br />Also, we introduce a new system of orthogonal functions with nice properties - structured orthogonal polynomials - and show that the system can be employed for a different kind of joint approximation of a function and its first derivative and may have property of shape preserving approximation. In addition, we show that structured orthogonal polynomials generate wavelet functions <br />We complement these results with definition of structured semi-orthogonal polynomials and introduce wavelet basis functions.;math.NA

We prove that for every torsion free lattice $\Gamma\subset {\rm Isom} X$ any homology class in $H_1(\Gamma\backslash X,\mathbb F_2)$ has a representative cycle of total length $o_X({\rm Vol}(\Gamma\backslash X))$. As an application we show that $\dim_{\mathbb F_2} H_1(\Gamma\backslash X,\mathbb F_2)=o_X({\rm Vol}(\Gamma\backslash X)).$;math.AT

Along the way, we establish that certain normalized special values of $L$-functions are squares of rational numbers, a result that is of independent interest, and can be regarded as instances of the rank zero case of the Birch and Swinnerton-dyer conjecture modulo squares.;math.NT
1801.09296;The Gaussian Double-Bubble Conjecture;We establish the Gaussian Double-Bubble Conjecture: the least Gaussian-weighted perimeter way to decompose $\mathbb{R}^n$ into three cells of prescribed (positive) Gaussian measure is to use a tripod-cluster, whose interfaces consist of three half-hyperplanes meeting along an $(n-2)$-dimensional plane at $120^{\circ}$ angles (forming a tripod or "Y" shape in the plane). Moreover, we prove that tripod-clusters are the unique isoperimetric minimizers (up to null-sets).;math.FA
1801.09298;Lower bound for the perimeter density at singular points of a minimizing cluster in $\mathbb R^N$;In this paper we study the blow-ups of the singular points in the boundary of a minimizing cluster lying in the interface of more than two chambers. We establish a sharp lower bound for the perimeter density at those points and we prove that this bound is rigid, namely having the lowest possible density completely characterizes the blow-up.;math.AP

1801.09306;Optimal Beam Sweeping and Communication in Mobile Millimeter-Wave Networks;Millimeter-wave (mm-wave) communications incur a high beam alignment cost in mobile scenarios such as vehicular networks. Therefore, an efficient beam alignment mechanism is required to mitigate the resulting overhead. In this paper, a one-dimensional mobility model is proposed where a mobile user (MU), such as a vehicle, moves along a straight road with time-varying and random speed, and communicates with base stations (BSs) located on the roadside over the mm-wave band. To compensate for location uncertainty, the BS widens its transmission beam and, when a critical beamwidth is achieved, it performs beam-sweeping to refine the MU position estimate, followed by data communication over a narrow beam. The average rate and average transmission power are computed in closed form and the optimal beamwidth for communication, number of sweeping beams, and transmission power allocation are derived so as to maximize the average rate under an average power constraint. Structural properties of the optimal design are proved, and a bisection algorithm to determine the optimal sweeping -- communication parameters is designed. It is shown numerically that an adaptation of the IEEE 802.11ad standard to the proposed model exhibits up to 90% degradation in spectral efficiency compared to the proposed scheme.;cs.IT

1801.09316;Gelfand-Tsetlin Theory for Rational Galois Algebras;In the present paper we study Gelfand-Tsetlin modules defined in terms of BGG differential operators. The structure of these modules is described with the aid of the Postnikov-Stanley polynomials introduced in [PS09]. These polynomials are used to identify the action of the Gelfand-Tsetlin subalgebra on the BGG operators. We also provide explicit bases of the corresponding Gelfand-Tsetlin modules and prove a simplicity criterion for these modules. The results hold for modules defined over standard Galois orders of type $A$ - a large class of rings that include the universal enveloping algebra of $\mathfrak{gl} (n)$ and the finite $W$-algebras of type $A$.;math.RT

This strengthens and completes earlier work by the authors. We also show that a similar conclusion holds for quasisymmetries of the double of $S_p$ across the outer peripheral circle. Finally, as an application of the techniques developed in this paper, we prove that no standard square carpet $S_p$ is quasisymmetrically equivalent to the Julia set of a postcritically-finite rational map.;math.CV
1801.09324;Strong error analysis for stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithms;Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithms are key ingredients in a series of machine learning applications. In this article we perform a rigorous strong error analysis for SGD optimization algorithms. In particular, we prove for every arbitrarily small $\varepsilon \in (0,\infty)$ and every arbitrarily large $p\in (0,\infty)$ that the considered SGD optimization algorithm converges in the strong $L^p$-sense with order $\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon$ to the global minimum of the objective function of the considered stochastic approximation problem under standard convexity-type assumptions on the objective function and relaxed assumptions on the moments of the stochastic errors appearing in the employed SGD optimization algorithm. The key ideas in our convergence proof are, first, to employ techniques from the theory of Lyapunov-type functions for dynamical systems to develop a general convergence machinery for SGD optimization algorithms based on such functions, then, to apply this general machinery to concrete Lyapunov-type functions with polynomial structures, and, thereafter, to perform an induction argument along the powers appearing in the Lyapunov-type functions in order to achieve for every arbitrarily large $ p \in (0,\infty) $ strong $ L^p $-convergence rates. This article also contains an extensive review of results on SGD optimization algorithms in the scientific literature.;math.NA
1801.09326;Sparse and Low-rank Tensor Estimation via Cubic Sketchings;In this paper, we propose a general framework for sparse and low-rank tensor estimation from cubic sketchings. A two-stage non-convex implementation is developed based on sparse tensor decomposition and thresholded gradient descent, which ensures exact recovery in the noiseless case and stable recovery in the noisy case with high probability. The non-asymptotic analysis sheds light on an interplay between optimization error and statistical error. The proposed procedure is shown to be rate-optimal under certain conditions. As a technical by-product, novel high-order concentration inequalities are derived for studying high-moment sub-Gaussian tensors. An interesting tensor formulation illustrates the potential application to high-order interaction pursuit in high-dimensional linear regression.;math.ST

1801.09339;Liquid State Machine Learning for Resource and Cache Management in LTE-U Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Networks;In this paper, the problem of joint caching and resource allocation is investigated for a network of cache-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that service wireless ground users over the LTE licensed and unlicensed (LTE-U) bands. The considered model focuses on users that can access both licensed and unlicensed bands while receiving contents from either the cache units at the UAVs directly or via content server-UAV-user links. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem which jointly incorporates user association, spectrum allocation, and content caching. To solve this problem, a distributed algorithm based on the machine learning framework of liquid state machine (LSM) is proposed. Using the proposed LSM algorithm, the cloud can predict the users' content request distribution while having only limited information on the network's and users' states. The proposed algorithm also enables the UAVs to autonomously choose the optimal resource allocation strategies that maximize the number of users with stable queues depending on the network states. Based on the users' association and content request distributions, the optimal contents that need to be cached at UAVs as well as the optimal resource allocation are derived. Simulation results using real datasets show that the proposed approach yields up to 33.3% and 50.3% gains, respectively, in terms of the number of users that have stable queues compared to two baseline algorithms: Q-learning with cache and Q-learning without cache. The results also show that LSM significantly improves the convergence time of up to 33.3% compared to conventional learning algorithms such as Q-learning.;cs.IT
1801.09340;Relativistic Wave Equations on the lattice: an operational perspective;This paper presents an operational framework for the computation of the discretized solutions for relativistic equations of Klein-Gordon and Dirac type. The proposed method relies on the construction of an evolution-type operador from the knowledge of the \textit{Exponential Generating Function} (EGF), carrying a degree lowering operator $L_t=L(\partial_t)$. We also use certain operational properties of the discrete Fourier transform over the $n-$dimensional \textit{Brioullin zone} $Q_h=\left(-\frac{\pi}{h},\frac{\pi}{h}\right]^n$ -- a toroidal Fourier transform in disguise -- to describe the discrete counterparts of the continuum wave propagators, $\cosh(t\sqrt{\Delta-m^2})$ and $\dfrac{\sinh(t\sqrt{\Delta-m^2})}{\sqrt{\Delta-m^2}}$ respectively, as discrete convolution operators. In this way, a huge class of discretized time-evolution problems of differential-difference and difference-difference type may be studied in the spirit of hypercomplex variables.;math-ph
1801.09341;Two fixed point theorems in complete random normed modules and their applications to backward stochastic equations;This paper first proves two fixed point theorems in complete random normed modules, which are respectively the random generalizations of the classical Banach's contraction mapping principle and Browder--Kirk's fixed point theorem. As applications, the first is used to give the existence and uniqueness of solutions to various kinds of backward stochastic equations under $L^0$--Lipschitz assumptions and the second is used to establish the existence of solutions to backward stochastic equations of nonexpansive type.;math.FA
1801.09348;Strong Approximation of Stochastic Allen-Cahn Equation with White Noise;We establish an optimal strong convergence rate of a fully discrete numerical scheme for second order parabolic stochastic partial differential equations with monotone drifts, including the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation, driven by an additive space-time white noise. Our first step is to transform the original stochastic equation into an equivalent random equation whose solution possesses more regularity than the original one. Then we use the backward Euler in time and spectral Galerkin in space to fully discretize this random equation. By the monotone assumption, in combination with the factorization method and stochastic calculus in martingale-type 2 Banach spaces, we derive a uniform maximum norm estimation and a H\"older-type regularity for both stochastic and random equations. Finally, the strong convergence rate of the proposed fully discrete scheme under the $l_t^\infty L^2_\omega L^2_x \cap l_t^q L^q_\omega L^q_x$-norm is obtained. Several numerical experiments are carried out to verify the theoretical result.;math.NA

1801.09366;Linearized estimate of the backward error for the equality constrained indefinite least squares problem;In this note, we concentrate on the backward error of the equality constrained indefinite least squares problem. For the normwise backward error of the equality constrained indefinite least square problem, we adopt the linearization method to derive the tight estimate for the exact backward normwise error. The numerical examples show that the linearization estimate is effective for the normwise backward errors.;math.NA
1801.09369;Two results on cardinal invariants at uncountable cardinals;We prove two ZFC theorems about cardinal invariants above the continuum which are in sharp contrast to well-known facts about these same invariants at the continuum. It is shown that for an uncountable regular cardinal $\kappa$, $\mathfrak{b}(\kappa) = {\kappa}^{+}$ implies $\mathfrak{a}(\kappa) = {\kappa}^{+}$. This improves an earlier result of Blass, Hyttinen, and Zhang. It is also shown that if $\kappa \geq {\beth}_{\omega}$ is an uncountable regular cardinal, then $\mathfrak{d}(\kappa) \leq \mathfrak{r}(\kappa)$. This result partially dualizes an earlier theorem of the authors.;math.LO
1801.09374;On superspecial abelian surfaces over finite fields II;Extending the results of [Asian J. Math. 2019], in [Doc. Math. \textbf{21}, 2016] we calculated explicitly the number of <br />isomorphism classes of superspecial abelian surfaces over an arbitrary finite field of \textit{odd} degree over the prime field <br />$\mathbb{F}_p$. A key step was to reduce the calculation to the prime field case, and we calculated the number of <br />isomorphism classes in each isogeny class through a concrete lattice description. In the present paper we treat the \textit{even} <br />degree case by a different method. We first translate the problem by Galois cohomology into a <br />seemingly unrelated problem of computing conjugacy classes of elements of finite order in arithmetic <br />subgroups, which is of independent interest. We then explain how tocalculate the number of these classes for the arithmetic <br />subgroups concerned, and complete the computation in the case of rank two. This complements our earlier results and completes the explicit <br />calculation of superspecial abelian surfaces over finite fields.;math.NT
1801.09377;On the validity of linear response theory in high-dimensional deterministic dynamical systems;This theoretical work considers the following conundrum: linear response theory is successfully used by scientists in numerous fields, but mathematicians have shown that typical low-dimensional dynamical systems violate the theory's assumptions. Here we provide a proof of concept for the validity of linear response theory in high-dimensional deterministic systems for large-scale observables. We introduce an exemplary model in which observables of resolved degrees of freedom are weakly coupled to a large, inhomogeneous collection of unresolved chaotic degrees of freedom. By employing statistical limit laws we give conditions under which such systems obey linear response theory even if all the degrees of freedom individually violate linear response. We corroborate our result with numerical simulations.;math.DS
1801.09380;The impact of the Bohr topology on selective pseudocompactness;Recall that a space X is selectively pseudocompact if for every sequence (U_n) of non-empty open subsets of X one can choose a point x_n in U_n for all n such that the resulting sequence (x_n) has an accumulation point in X. This notion was introduced under the name strong pseudocompactness by Garc\'ia-Ferreira and Ortiz-Castillo, the present name is due to Dorantes-Aldama and the first author. In 2015, Garc\'ia-Ferreira and Tomita constructed a pseudocompact Boolean group that is not selectively pseudocompact. We prove that if the subgroup topology on every countable subgroup H of an infinite Boolean topological group G is finer than its maximal precompact topology (the so-called Bohr topology of H), then G is not selectively pseudocompact, and from this result we deduce that many known examples in the literature of pseudocompact Boolean groups automatically fail to be selectively pseudocompact. We also show that, under the Singular Cardinal Hypothesis, every infinite pseudocompact Boolean group admits a pseudocompact reflexive group topology which is not selectively pseudocompact.;math.GN
1801.09383;Wireless Powered Asynchronous Backscatter Networks with Sporadic Short Packets: Performance Analysis and Optimization;In the fifth generation era, the pervasive applications of Internet of Things and massive machine-type communications have initiated increasing research interests on the backscatter wireless powered communication (B-WPC) technique due to its ultra high energy efficiency and low cost. The ubiquitous B-WPC network is characterized by nodes with dynamic spatial positions and sporadic short packets, of which the performance has not been fully investigated. In this paper, we give a comprehensive analysis of a multi-antenna B-WPC network with sporadic short packets under a stochastic geometry framework. By exploiting a time-space Poisson point process model, the behavior of the network is well captured in a decentralized and asynchronous transmission way. We then analyze the energy and information outage performance in the energy harvest and backscatter modulation phases of the backscatter network, respectively. The optimal transmission slot length and division are obtained by maximizing the network-wide spatial throughput. Moreover, we find an interesting result that there exists the optimal tradeoff between the durations of the energy harvest and backscatter modulation phases for spatial throughput maximization. Numerical results are demonstrated to verify our analytical findings and show that this tradeoff region gets shrunk when the outage constraints become more stringent.;cs.IT
1801.09385;An example of birationally inequivalent projective symplectic varieties which are D-equivalent and L-equivalent;We give an example of a pair of projective symplectic varieties in arbitrarily large dimensions which are D-equivalent, L-equivalent, and birationally inequivalent.;math.AG
1801.09387;On the Quadratic Convergence of the Cubic Regularization Method under a Local Error Bound Condition;In this paper we consider the cubic regularization (CR) method for minimizing a twice continuously differentiable function. While the CR method is widely recognized as a globally convergent variant of Newton's method with superior iteration complexity, existing results on its local quadratic convergence require a stringent non-degeneracy condition. We prove that under a local error bound (EB) condition, which is much weaker a requirement than the existing non-degeneracy condition, the sequence of iterates generated by the CR method converges at least Q-quadratically to a second-order critical point. This indicates that adding a cubic regularization not only equips Newton's method with remarkable global convergence properties but also enables it to converge quadratically even in the presence of degenerate solutions. As a byproduct, we show that without assuming convexity, the proposed EB condition is equivalent to a quadratic growth condition, which could be of independent interest. To demonstrate the usefulness and relevance of our convergence analysis, we focus on two concrete nonconvex optimization problems that arise in phase retrieval and low-rank matrix recovery, respectively, and prove that with overwhelming probability, the sequence of iterates generated by the CR method for solving these two problems converges at least Q-quadratically to a global minimizer. We also present numerical results of the CR method when applied to solve these two problems to support and complement our theoretical development.;math.OC
1801.09391;Safeguarding Millimeter Wave Communications Against Randomly Located Eavesdroppers;Millimeter wave offers a sensible solution to the capacity crunch faced by 5G wireless communications. This paper comprehensively studies physical layer security in a multi-input single-output (MISO) millimeter wave system where multiple single-antenna eavesdroppers are randomly located. Concerning the specific propagation characteristics of millimeter wave, we investigate two secure transmission schemes, namely maximum ratio transmitting (MRT) beamforming and artificial noise (AN) beamforming. Specifically, we first derive closed-form expressions of the connection probability for both schemes. We then analyze the secrecy outage probability (SOP) in both non-colluding eavesdroppers and colluding eavesdroppers scenarios. Also, we maximize the secrecy throughput under a SOP constraint, and obtain optimal transmission parameters, especially the power allocation between AN and the information signal for AN beamforming. Numerical results are provided to verify our theoretical analysis. We observe that the density of eavesdroppers, the spatially resolvable paths of the destination and eavesdroppers all contribute to the secrecy performance and the parameter design of millimeter wave systems.;cs.IT
1801.09395;Global well-posedness of the 1D compressible Navier-Stokes equations with constant heat conductivity and nonnegative density;In this paper we consider the initial-boundary value problem to the one-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations for idea gases. Both the viscous and heat conductive coefficients are assumed to be positive constants, and the initial density is allowed to have vacuum. Global existence and uniqueness of strong solutions is established for any $H^2$ initial data, which generalizes the well-known result of Kazhikhov--Shelukhin (Kazhikhov, A. V., Shelukhin, V. V.: \emph{Unique global solution with respect to time of initial boundary value problems for one-dimensional equations of a viscous gas, J. Appl. Math. Mech., 41 (1977), 273--282.) to the case that with nonnegative initial density.;math.AP
1801.09396;A transmission problem on a polygonal partition: regularity and shape differentiability;We consider a transmission problem on a polygonal partition for the two-dimensional conductivity equation. For suitable classes of partitions we establish the exact behaviour of the gradient of solutions in a neighbourhood of the vertexes of the partition. This allows to prove shape differentiability of solutions and to establish an explicit formula for the shape derivative.;math.AP
1801.09398;Operational calculus for Fourier transform on the group $GL(2,R)$;Consider the Fourier transform on the group $GL(2,R)$ of real $2\times 2$-matrices. We show that Fourier-images of polynomial differential operators on $GL(2,R)$ are differential-difference operators with coefficients meromorphic in parameters of representations. Expressions for operators contain shifts in imaginary direction with respect to the integration contour in the Plancherel formula. We present explicit formulas for images of partial derivations and multiplications by coordinates.;math.RT
1801.09400;Curvature calculations for antitrees;In this article we prove that antitrees with suitable growth properties are examples of infinite graphs exhibiting strictly positive curvature in various contexts: in the normalized and non-normalized Bakry-\'Emery setting as well in the Ollivier-Ricci curvature case. We also show that these graphs do not have global positive lower curvature bounds, which one would expect in view of discrete analogues of the Bonnet-Myers theorem. The proofs in the different settings require different techniques.;math.CO
1801.09401;Natural density and probability, constructively;We give here a constructive account of the frequentist approach to probability, by means of natural density. Using this notion of natural density, we introduce some probabilistic versions of the Limited Principle of Omniscience. Finally we give an attempt general definition of probability structure which is pointfree and takes into account abstractely the process of probability assignment.;math.LO
1801.09404;The stabilization of the Frobenius--Hecke traces on the intersection cohomology of orthogonal Shimura varieties;The orthogonal Shimura varieties are associated to special orthogonal groups over $\mathbb Q$ of signature $(n,2)$ at infinity. We consider the intersection cohomology of their Baily--Borel compactifications, and prove a version of Morel's formula for the Frobenius--Hecke traces on it for almost all primes. Our main result is the stabilization of this formula. As an application, we compute the Hasse--Weil zeta function of the intersection cohomology in some special cases, using the recent work of Arthur and Ta\"ibi on the endoscopic classification of automorphic representations of special orthogonal groups.;math.NT
1801.09408;Convergence of a Finite-Volume Scheme for a Degenerate Cross-Diffusion Model for Ion Transport;An implicit Euler finite-volume scheme for a degenerate cross-diffusion system describing the ion transport through biological membranes is analyzed. The strongly coupled equations for the ion concentrations include drift terms involving the electric potential, which is coupled to the concentrations through the Poisson equation. The cross-diffusion system possesses a formal gradient-flow structure revealing nonstandard degen-eracies, which lead to considerable mathematical difficulties. The finite-volume scheme is based on two-point flux approximations with "double" upwind mobilities. It preserves the structure of the continuous model like nonnegativity, upper bounds, and entropy dis-sipation. The degeneracy is overcome by proving a new discrete Aubin-Lions lemma of "degenerate" type. Under suitable assumptions, the existence and uniqueness of bounded discrete solutions, a discrete entropy inequality, and the convergence of the scheme is proved. Numerical simulations of a calcium-selective ion channel in two space dimensions indicate that the numerical scheme is of first order.;math.NA
1801.09410;A free boundary problem with non local interaction;We prove local existence for classical solutions of a free boundary problem which arises in one of the biological selection models proposed by Brunet and Derrida, [2] and Durrett and Remenik, [14]. The problem we consider describes the limit evolution of branching brownian particles on the line with death of the leftmost particle at each creation time as studied in [12]. We use extensively results in [5] and [15].;math.PR
1801.09411;Hyperbolicity and Cubulability Are Preserved Under Elementary Equivalence;The following properties are preserved under elementary equivalence, among finitely generated groups: being hyperbolic (possibly with torsion), being hyperbolic and cubulable, and being a subgroup of a hyperbolic group. In other words, if a finitely generated group G has the same first-order theory as a group possessing one of the previous property, then G enjoys this property as well.;math.GR
1801.09416;Asymptotic behaviour of the Sudler product of sines for quadratic irrationals;We study the asymptotic behaviour of the sequence of sine products $P_n(\alpha) = \prod_{r=1}^n |2\sin \pi r \alpha|$ for real quadratic irrationals $\alpha$. In particular, we study the subsequence $Q_n(\alpha)=\prod_{r=1}^{q_n} |2\sin \pi r \alpha|$, where $q_n$ is the $n$th best approximation denominator of $\alpha$, and show that this subsequence converges to a periodic sequence whose period equals that of the continued fraction expansion of $\alpha$. This verifies a conjecture recently posed by Mestel and Verschueren.;math.NT
1801.09419;A notion of stability for k-means clustering;In this paper, we define and study a new notion of stability for the $k$-means clustering scheme building upon the notion of quantization of a probability measure. We connect this notion of stability to a geometric feature of the underlying distribution of the data, named absolute margin condition, inspired by recent works on the subject.;math.ST
1801.09422;On the first Zassenhaus conjecture and direct products;In this paper we study the behavior of the first Zassenhaus conjecture (ZC1) under direct products as well as the General Bovdi Problem (Gen-BP) which turns out to be a slightly weaker variant of (ZC1). Among others we prove that (Gen-BP) holds for Sylow tower groups, so in particular for the class of supersolvable groups. (ZC1) is established for a direct product of Sylow-by-abelian groups provided the normal Sylow subgroups form together a Hall subgroup. We also show (ZC1) for certain direct products with one of the factors a Frobenius group. We extend the classical HeLP method to group rings with coefficients from any ring of algebraic integers. This is used to study (ZC1) for the direct product $G \times A$, where $A$ is a finite abelian group and $G$ has order at most 95. For most of these groups we show that (ZC1) is valid and for all of them that (Gen-BP) holds. Moreover, we also prove that (Gen-BP) holds for the direct product of a Frobenius group with any finite abelian group.;math.RA
1801.09425;Jacob&#x27,s ladders and new families of $&#x3b6,$-kindred real continuous functions;In this paper we obtain, by our method of crossbreeding in certain set of $\zeta$-factorization formulas, the corresponding complete hybrid formulas. These are playing the role of criterion for selection of new families of $\zeta$-kindred real continuous functions.;math.CA
1801.09433;Self-duality of Markov processes and intertwining functions;We present a theorem which elucidates the connection between self-duality of Markov processes and representation theory of Lie algebras. In particular, we identify sufficient conditions such that the intertwining function between two representations of a certain Lie algebra is the self-duality function of a (Markov) operator. In concrete terms, the two representations are associated to two operators in interwining relation. The self-dual operator, which arise from an appropriate symmetric linear combination of them, is the generator of a Markov process. The theorem is applied to a series of examples, including Markov processes with a discrete state space (e.g. interacting particle systems) and Markov processes with continuous state space (e.g. diffusion processes). In the examples we use explicit representations of Lie algebras that are unitary equivalent. As a consequence, in the discrete setting self-duality functions are given by orthogonal polynomials whereas in the continuous context they are Bessel functions.;math.PR
1801.09435;Non-local elasticity theory as a continuous limit of 3D networks of pointwise interacting masses;Small oscillations of an elastic system of point masses (particles) with a nonlocal interaction are considered. We study the asymptotic behavior of the system, when number of particles tends to infinity, and the distances between them and the forces of interaction tends to zero. The first term of the asymptotic is described by the homogenized system of equations, which is a nonlocal model of oscillations of elastic medium.;math.AP
1801.09440;Multiplicative ergodic theorem for a non-irreducible random dynamical system;We study the asymptotic properties of the trajectories of a discrete-time random dynamical system in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. Under some natural assumptions on the model, we establish a multiplica-tive ergodic theorem with an exponential rate of convergence. The assumptions are satisfied for a large class of parabolic PDEs, including the 2D Navier--Stokes and complex Ginzburg--Landau equations perturbed by a non-degenerate bounded random kick force. As a consequence of this er-godic theorem, we derive some new results on the statistical properties of the trajectories of the underlying random dynamical system. In particular , we obtain large deviations principle for the occupation measures and the analyticity of the pressure function in a setting where the system is not irreducible. The proof relies on a refined version of the uniform Feller property combined with some contraction and bootstrap arguments.;math.AP
1801.09450;Allen-Cahn equation with strong irreversibility;This paper is concerned with a fully nonlinear variant of the Allen-Cahn equation with strong irreversibility, where each solution is constrained to be non-decreasing in time. Main purposes of the paper are to prove the well-posedness, smoothing effect and comparison principle, to provide an equivalent reformulation of the equation as a parabolic obstacle problem and to reveal long-time behaviors of solutions. More precisely, by deriving \emph{partial} energy-dissipation estimates, a global attractor is constructed in a metric setting, and it is also proved that each solution $u(x,t)$ converges to a solution of an elliptic obstacle problem as $t \to +\infty$.;math.AP
1801.09457;Analytical Study of a Class of Rational Difference Equations;We obtain the solution of the fourth order difference equation $$ x_{n+1}=\frac{ \alpha x_{n-3}}{A+B x_{n-1}x_{n-3}}$$ with the initial conditions, $x_{-3}=d,$ $x_{-2}=c,$ $x_{-1}=b,$ and $x_{0}=a$ are arbitrary nonzero real numbers, $\alpha$, $A$ and $B$ are arbitrary constants. The result is used to study the convergence of solutions, the existence of unbounded solutions and the convergence to periodic solutions. We illustrate the results by several numerical examples.;math.DS

In particular, a new approximation to the $\delta'$-interactions is obtained.;math.SP
1801.09470;The Poisson equation from non-local to local;We analyze the limit behavior as $s\to 1^-$ of the solution to the fractional Poisson equation $(-\Delta)^s u_s=f_s$, $x\in\Omega$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions $u_s\equiv 0$, $x\in\Omega^c$. We show that $\lim_{s\to 1^-} u_s =u$, with $-\Delta u =f$, $x\in\Omega$ and $u=0$, $x\in\partial\Omega$. Our results are complemented by a discussion on the rate of convergence and on extensions to the parabolic setting.;math.AP
1801.09478;Bounded multiplicative Toeplitz operators on sequence spaces;In this paper, we study the linear mapping which sends the sequence $x=(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ to $y=(y_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ where $y_n = \sum_{k=1}^\infty f(n/k)x_k$ for $f: \mathbb{Q}^+ \to \mathbb{C}$. This operator is the multiplicative analogue of the classical Toeplitz operator, and as such we denote the mapping by $\mathscr{M}_f$. We show that for $1 \leq p \leq q \leq \infty$, if $f \in \ell^r(\mathbb{Q}^+)$, then $\mathscr{M}_f:\ell^p \to \ell^q$ is bounded where $\frac{1}{r} = 1 - \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} $. Moreover, for the cases when $p=1$ with any $q$, $p=q$, and $q=\infty$ with any $p$, we find that the operator norm is given by $\|\mathscr{M}_f\|_{p,q} = \|f\|_{r,\mathbb{Q}^+}$ when $f \geq 0$. Finding a necessary condition and the operator norm for the remaining cases highlights an interesting connection between the operator norm of $\mathscr{M}_f$ and elements in $\ell^p$ that have a multiplicative structure, when considering $f:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{C}$. We also provide an argument suggesting that $f \in \ell^r$ may not be a necessary condition for boundedness when $1&lt,p&lt,q&lt,\infty$.;math.FA
1801.09480;Finite projective planes and the Delsarte LP-bound;We apply an improvement of the Delsarte LP-bound to give a new proof of the non-existence of finite projective planes of order 6, and uniqueness of finite projective planes of order 7. The proof is computer aided, and it is also feasible to apply to higher orders like 8, 9 and, with further improvements, possibly 10 and 12.;math.CO
1801.09481;Almost Optimal Scaling of Reed-Muller Codes on BEC and BSC Channels;Consider a binary linear code of length $N$, minimum distance $d_{\text{min}}$, transmission over the binary erasure channel with parameter $0 &lt, \epsilon &lt, 1$ or the binary symmetric channel with parameter $0 &lt, \epsilon &lt, \frac12$, and block-MAP decoding. It was shown by Tillich and Zemor that in this case the error probability of the block-MAP decoder transitions "quickly" from $\delta$ to $1-\delta$ for any $\delta&gt,0$ if the minimum distance is large. In particular the width of the transition is of order $O(1/\sqrt{d_{\text{min}}})$. We strengthen this result by showing that under suitable conditions on the weight distribution of the code, the transition width can be as small as $\Theta(1/N^{\frac12-\kappa})$, for any $\kappa&gt,0$, even if the minimum distance of the code is not linear. This condition applies e.g., to Reed-Mueller codes. Since $\Theta(1/N^{\frac12})$ is the smallest transition possible for any code, we speak of "almost" optimal scaling. We emphasize that the width of the transition says nothing about the location of the transition. Therefore this result has no bearing on whether a code is capacity-achieving or not. As a second contribution, we present a new estimate on the derivative of the EXIT function, the proof of which is based on the Blowing-Up Lemma.;cs.IT
1801.09483;Using B-spline frames to approximate solutions of acoustic scattering problems;Although frames, which are a generalization of bases, are important tools used in signal processing, their potential in other fields of engineering and applied mathematics (e.g. acoustics) has not been fully explored yet. Gabor frames, that are specific type of frames, are very well adapted to oscillating functions, and therefore have a great potential to efficiently represent functions in connection with the Helmholtz operator. In this paper representations of the solution of a scattering problem in 2D using Gabor frames based on B-splines as building blocks are investigated. Practical issues concerning the implementation of frames like the restriction of the frame elements to a finite interval and methods to determine the unknown coefficients for the representation, i.e. by using dual frames or by solving a least squares problem, are discussed. Numerical experiments are made comparing the different ways to determine the unknown expansion coefficients and the representations are compared in terms of their efficiency, i.e. the number of used frame coefficients versus the accuracy of the approximation. In all cases the coefficients calculated with a slightly modified orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm provide the best accuracy versus sparsity ratio.;math.NA
1801.09485;Ultra Reliable Communication via Opportunistic ARQ Transmission in Cognitive Networks;This paper presents a novel opportunistic spectrum sharing scheme that applies ARQ protocol to achieve ultra reliability in the finite blocklength regime. A primary user shares its licensed spectrum to a secondary user, where both communicate to the same base station. The base station applies ARQ with the secondary user, which possess a limited number of trials to transmit each packet. We resort to the interweave model in which the secondary user senses the primary user activity and accesses the channel with access probabilities which depend on the primary user arrival rate and the number of available trials. We characterize the secondary user access probabilities and transmit power in order to achieve target error constraints for both users. Furthermore, we analyze the primary user performance in terms of outage probability and delay. The results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the open loop and non-opportunistic scenarios in terms of secondary user transmit power saving and primary user reliability.;cs.IT
1801.09486;On the Effective Energy Efficiency of Ultra-reliable Networks in the Finite Blocklength Regime;Effective Capacity (EC) indicates the maximum communication rate subject to a certain delay constraint while effective energy efficiency (EEE) denotes the ratio between EC and power consumption. In this paper, we analyze the EEE of ultra-reliable networks operating in the finite blocklength regime. We obtain a closed form approximation for the EEE in Rayleigh block fading channels as a function of power, error probability, and delay. We show the optimum power allocation strategy for maximizing the EEE in finite blocklength transmission which reveals that Shannon's model underestimates the optimum power when compared to the exact finite blocklength model. Furthermore, we characterize the buffer constrained EEE maximization problem for different power consumption models. The results show that accounting for empty buffer probability (EBP) and extending the maximum delay tolerance jointly enhance the EC and EEE.;cs.IT
1801.09487;The Bulk-Edge Correspondence for Disordered Chiral Chains;We study one-dimensional insulators obeying a chiral symmetry in the single-particle picture. The Fermi level is assumed to lie in a mobility gap. Topological indices are defined for infinite (bulk) or half-infinite (edge) systems, and it is shown that for a given Hamiltonian with nearest neighbor hopping the two indices are equal. We also give a new formulation of the index in terms of the Lyapunov exponents of the zero energy Schr\"odinger equation, which illustrates the conditions for a topological phase transition occurring in the mobility gap regime.;math-ph
1801.09491;Estimates of Green and Martin kernels for Schr&#xf6,dinger operators with singular potential in Lipschitz domains;Consider operators of the form $L^{\gamma V}:=\Delta +\gamma V$ in a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^N$. Assume that $V\in C^1(\Omega)$ satisfies $|V(x)| \leq \bar a \,\mathrm{distance}\,(x,\partial\Omega)^{-2}$ for every $x\in \Omega$ and $\gamma$ is a number in a range $(\gamma_-,\gamma_+)$ described in the introduction. The model case is $V(x)= \mathrm{distance}\,(x,F)^{-2}$ where $F$ is a closed subset of $\partial\Omega$ and $\gamma&lt, c_H(V)=$ Hardy constant for $V$. We provide sharp two sided estimates of the Green and Martin kernel for $L^{\gamma V}$ in $\Omega$. In addition we establish a pointwise version of the 3G inequality.;math.AP
1801.09498;On Iwasawa theory of Rubin-Stark units and narrow class groups;Let $K$ be a totally real number field of degree $r$. Let $K_{\infty}$ denote the cyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-extension of $K$ and let $L_{\infty}$ be a finite extension of $K_{\infty}$, abelian over $K$. The goal of this paper is to compare the characteristic ideal of the $\chi$-quotient of the projective limit of the narrow class groups to the $\chi$-quotient of the projective limit of the $r$-th exterior power of totally positive units modulo a subgroup of Rubin-Stark units, for some $\overline{\mathbb{Q}_{2}}$-irreducible characters $\chi$ of $\mathrm{Gal}(L_{\infty}/K_{\infty})$.;math.NT
1801.09499;Efficient parameter estimation for a methane hydrate model with active subspaces;Methane gas hydrates have increasingly become a topic of interest because of their potential as a future energy resource. There are significant economical and environmental risks associated with extraction from hydrate reservoirs, so a variety of multiphysics models have been developed to analyze prospective risks and benefits. These models generally have a large number of empirical parameters which are not known a priori. Traditional optimization-based parameter estimation frameworks may be ill-posed or computationally prohibitive. Bayesian inference methods have increasingly been found effective for estimating parameters in complex geophysical systems. These methods often are not viable in cases of computationally expensive models and high-dimensional parameter spaces. Recently, methods have been developed to effectively reduce the dimension of Bayesian inverse problems by identifying low-dimensional structures that are most informed by data. Active subspaces is one of the most generally applicable methods of performing this dimension reduction. In this paper, Bayesian inference of the parameters of a state-of-the-art mathematical model for methane hydrates based on experimental data from a triaxial compression test with gas hydrate-bearing sand is performed in an efficient way by utilizing active subspaces. Active subspaces are used to identify low-dimensional structure in the parameter space which is exploited by generating a cheap regression-based surrogate model and implementing a modified Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Posterior densities having means that match the experimental data are approximated in a computationally efficient way.;math.NA
1801.09501;Non-Leaving-Face property for marked surfaces;We consider the polytope arising from a marked surface by flips of triangulations. Sleator, Tarjan and Thurston studied in 1988 the diameter of the associahedron, which is the polytope arising from a marked disc by flips of triangulations. They showed that every shortest path between two vertices in a face does not leave that face. We establish that same non-leaving-face property for all unpunctured marked surfaces.;math.CO
1801.09505;The number of homomorphisms from the Hawaiian earring group;We show a dichotomy for groups of cardinality less than continuum. The number of homomorphisms from the Hawaiian earring group to such a group $G$ is either the cardinality of $G$ in case $G$ is noncommutatively slender, or the number is $2^{2^{\aleph_0}}$ in case $G$ is not noncommutatively slender. An example of a noncommutatively slender group with nontrivial divisible element is exhibited.;math.GR
1801.09507;The exit time finite state projection scheme: bounding exit distributions and occupation measures of continuous-time Markov chains;We introduce the exit time finite state projection (ETFSP) scheme, a truncation-based method that yields approximations to the exit distribution and occupation measure associated with the time of exit from a domain (i.e., the time of first passage to the complement of the domain) of time-homogeneous continuous-time Markov chains. We prove that: (i) the computed approximations bound the measures from below, (ii) the total variation distances between the approximations and the measures decrease monotonically as states are added to the truncation, and (iii) the scheme converges, in the sense that, as the truncation tends to the entire state space, the total variation distances tend to zero. Furthermore, we give a computable bound on the total variation distance between the exit distribution and its approximation, and we delineate the cases in which the bound is sharp. We also revisit the related finite state projection scheme and give a comprehensive account of its theoretical properties. We demonstrate the use of the ETFSP scheme by applying it to two biological examples: the computation of the first passage time associated with the expression of a gene, and the fixation times of competing species subject to demographic noise.;math.PR
1801.09512;The Spherical Mean Transform with Data on a Parabola in the Plane;In this paper we deal with the problem of recovering functions from their spherical mean transform $\mathcal{R}$, which integrates functions on circles in the plane, in case where the centers of the circles of integration are located on a parabola $\mathcal{P}$ while their radii can be chosen arbitrarily. Using our data, on the values of $\mathcal{R}$ on $\mathcal{P}$, we show how to extract its values in the exterior of $\mathcal{P}$ in case where the functions in question have compact support inside $\mathcal{P}$. Hence, one can use known inversion formulas for $\mathcal{R}$ in the exterior of $\mathcal{P}$ in order to obtain a reconstruction formula.;math.AP
1801.09516;A Pascal-like Bound for the Number of Necklaces with Fixed Density;A bound resembling Pascal's identity is presented for binary necklaces with fixed density using Lyndon words with fixed density. The result is generalized to k-ary necklaces and Lyndon words with fixed content. The bound arises in the study of Nichols algebras of diagonal type.;math.CO
1801.09525;Grow-up for a quasilinear heat equation with a localized reaction;We study the behaviour of global solutions to the quasilinear heat equation with a reaction localized $$ u_t=(u^m)_{xx}+a(x) u^p, $$ $m, p&gt,0$ and $a(x)$ being the characteristic function of an interval. we prove that there exists $p_0=\max\{1,\frac{m+1}2\}$ such that all global solution are bounded if $p&gt,p_0$, while for $p\le p_0$ all the solution are global and unbounded. In the last case, we prove that if $p&lt,m$ the grow-up rate is different to the one obtained when $a(x)\equiv1$, while if $p&gt,m$ the grow-up rate coincides with that rate, but only inside the support of $a$, outside the interval the rate is smaller.;math.AP
1801.09527;A Local Approach for Information Transfer;In this work, a strategy to estimate the information transfer between the elements of a complex system, from the time series associated to the evolution of this elements, is presented. By using the nearest neighbors of each state, the local approaches of the deterministic dynamical rule generating the data and the probability density functions, both marginals and conditionals, necessaries to calculate some measures of information transfer, are estimated. The performance of the method using numerically simulated data and real signals is exposed.;cs.IT
1801.09531;Fekete-Szego Inequality for Analytic and Bi-univalent Functions Subordinate to Chebyshev Polynomials;In the present paper, a new subclass of analytic and bi-univalent functions by means of Chebyshev polynomials is introduced. Certain coefficient bounds for functions belong to this subclass are obtained. Furthermore, the Fekete-Szego problem in this subclass is solved.;math.CV
1801.09532;Quotient Categories and Phases;We study properties of a category after quotienting out a suitable chosen group of isomorphisms on each object. Coproducts in the original category are described in its quotient by our new weaker notion of a 'phased coproduct'. We examine these and show that any suitable category with them arises as such a quotient of a category with coproducts. Motivation comes from projective geometry, and also quantum theory where they describe superpositions in the category of Hilbert spaces and continuous linear maps up to global phase. The quotients we consider also generalise those induced by categorical isotropy in the sense of Funk et al.;math.CT
1801.09537;Positive-definiteness and integral representations for special functions;We characterize a holomorphic positive definite function $f$ defined on a horizontal strip of the complex plane as the Fourier-Laplace transform of a unique exponentially finite measure on $\mathbb{R}$. The classical theorems of Bochner on positive definite functions and of Widder on exponentially convex functions become special cases of this characterization: they are respectively the real and pure imaginary sections of the complex integral representation. We apply this representation to special cases, including the $\Gamma$, $\zeta$ and Bessel functions, and construct explicitly the corresponding measures, thus providing new insight into the nature of complex positive and co-positive definite functions: in the case of the zeta function this process leads to a new proof of an integral representation on the critical strip.;math.CV
1801.09538;Grow-up for a quasilinear heat equation with a localized reaction in higher dimensions;We study the behaviour of nonnegative solutions to the quasilinear heat equation with a reaction localized in a ball $$ u_t=\Delta u^m+a(x)u^p, $$ for $m&gt,0$, $0&lt,p\le\max\{1,m\}$, $a(x)=\mathds{1}_{B_L}(x)$, $0&lt,L&lt,\infty$ and $N\ge2$. We study when solutions, which are global in time, are bounded or unbounded. In particular we show that the precise value of the length $L$ plays a crucial role in the critical case $p=m$ for $N\ge3$. We also obtain the asymptotic behaviour of unbounded solutions and prove that the grow-up rate is different in most of the cases to the one obtained when $L=\infty$.;math.AP
1801.09539;Julia sets with a wandering branching point;According to the Thurston No Wandering Triangle Theorem, a branching point in a locally connected quadratic Julia set is either preperiodic or precritical. Blokh and Oversteegen proved that this theorem does not hold for higher degree Julia sets: there exist cubic polynomials whose Julia set is a locally connected dendrite with a branching point which is neither preperiodic nor precritical. In this article, we reprove this result, constructing such cubic polynomials as limits of cubic polynomials for which one critical point eventually maps to the other critical point which eventually maps to a repelling fixed point.;math.DS
1801.09540;Bayesian inverse problems with non-commuting operators;The Bayesian approach to ill-posed operator equations in Hilbert space recently gained attraction. In this context, and when the prior distribution is Gaussian, then two operators play a significant role, the one which governs the operator equation, and the one which describes the prior covariance. Typically it is assumed that these operators commute. Here we extend this analysis to non-commuting operators, replacing the commutativity assumption by a link condition. We discuss its relation to the commuting case, and we indicate that this allows to use interpolation type results to obtain tight bounds for the contraction of the posterior Gaussian distribution towards the data generating element.;math.ST
1801.09542;Quantized Constant Envelope Precoding with PSK and QAM Signaling;Coarsely quantized massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems are gaining more interest due to their power efficiency. We present a new precoding technique to mitigate the Multi-User Interference (MUI) and the quantization distortions in a downlink Multi-User (MU) MIMO system with coarsely Quantized Constant Envelope (QCE) signals at the transmitter. The transmit signal vector is optimized for every desired received vector taking into account the QCE constraint. The optimization is based on maximizing the safety margin to the decision thresholds of the receiver constellation modulation. Simulation results show a significant gain in terms of the uncoded Bit Error Ratio (BER) compared to the existing linear precoding techniques.;cs.IT
1801.09544;Moschovakis Extension of Represented Spaces;Given a represented space (in the sense of TTE theory), an appropriate representation is constructed for the Moschovakis extension of its carrier (with paying attention to the cases of effective topological spaces and effective metric spaces). Some results are presented about TTE computability in the represented space obtained in this way. For single-valued functions, we prove, roughly speaking, the computability of any function which is absolutely prime computable in some computable functions. A similar result holds for multi-valued functions, but with an analog of absolute prime computability. The formulation of this result makes use of the notion of computability in iterative combinatory spaces - a notion studied by the author in other publications.;math.LO
1801.09548;On the Sobolev-Poincare inequality of CR-manifolds;The purpose is to study the CR-manifold with a contact structure conformal to the Heisenberg group. In our previous work \cite{WY}, we have proved that if the $Q'$-curvature is nonnegative, and the integral of $Q'$-curvature is below the dimensional bound $c_1'$, then we have the isoperimetric inequality. In this paper, we manage to drop the condition on the nonnegativity of the $Q'$-curvature. We prove that the volume form $e^{4u}$ is a strong $A_\infty$ weight. As a corollary, we prove the Sobolev-Poincar\'e inequality on a class of CR-manifolds with integrable $Q'$-curvature.;math.DG
1801.09552;Automaton (Semi)groups (Basic Concepts);In this paper, we give an introduction to basic concepts of automaton semigroups. While we must note that this paper does not contain new results, it is focused on extended introduction in the subject and detailed examples.;math.GR
1801.09553;Extending the Algebraic Manipulability of Differentials;Treating differentials as independent algebraic units have a long history of use and abuse. It is generally considered problematic to treat the derivative as a fraction of differentials rather than as a holistic unit acting as a limit, though for practical reasons it is often done for the first derivative. However, using a revised notation for the second and higher derivatives will allow for the ability to treat differentials as independent units for a much larger number of cases.;math.GM
1801.09557;Families of Solutions of Algebraic Riccati Equations;We consider Homogeneous Algebraic Riccati Equations in the general situation when the matrix of the dynamics can be "mixed". We show that in this case the equation may have infinitely many families of solutions. An analysis of these families is carried over and explicit formulas are derived. We also derive sufficient conditions under which the union of the families covers the whole set of solutions.;math.OC
1801.09562;On interpolating sesqui-harmonic maps between Riemannian manifolds;Motivated from the action functional for bosonic strings with extrinsic curvature term we introduce an action functional for maps between Riemannian manifolds that interpolates between the actions for harmonic and biharmonic maps. Critical points of this functional will be called interpolating sesqui-harmonic maps. In this article we initiate a rigorous mathematical treatment of this functional and study various basic aspects of its critical points.;math.DG
1801.09564;The asymptotic behavior of primitive equations with multiplicative noise;This paper is concerned with the existence of invariant measure for 3D stochastic primitive equations driven by linear multiplicative noise under non-periodic boundary conditions. The common method is to apply Sobolev imbedding theorem to proving the tightness of the distribution of the solution. However, this method fails because of the non-linearity and non-periodic boundary conditions of the stochastic primitive equations. To overcome the difficulties, we show the existence of random attractor by proving the compact property and the regularity of the solution operator. Then we show the existence of invariant measure.;math.PR
1801.09565;Large deviations for nematic liquid crystals driven by pure jump noise;In this paper, we establish a large deviation principle for a stochastic evolution equation which describes the system governing the nematic liquid crystals driven by pure jump noise. The proof is based on the weak convergence approach.;math.PR
1801.09570;A compactness result for an elliptic equation in dimension 2;We give blow-up analysis for the solutions of an elliptic equation under some conditions. Also, we derive a compactness result for this equation.;math.AP
1801.09572;A new Cartan-type property and strict quasicoverings when $p=1$ in metric spaces;In a complete metric space that is equipped with a doubling measure and supports a Poincar\'e inequality, we prove a new Cartan-type property for the fine topology in the case $p=1$. Then we use this property to prove the existence of $1$-finely open \emph{strict subsets} and \emph{strict quasicoverings} of $1$-finely open sets. As an application, we study fine Newton-Sobolev spaces in the case $p=1$, that is, Newton-Sobolev spaces defined on $1$-finely open sets.;math.MG
1801.09575;Antipodal Point Arrangements on Spheres, Classification of Normal Systems and Very Generic Hyperplane Arrangements over Ordered Fields;For any positive integer $k$, we classify the antipodal point arrangements (Definitions $[2.1,3.1,3.2,5.1,5.2]$) on the sphere $\mathbb{PF}^{k+}_{\mathbb{F}}$ over an ordered field $\mathbb{F}$ (Definition $1.1$), up to an isomorphism, by associating a finite complete set of cycle invariants. The classification for dimension $k = 2$ is done in Theorem $3.7$ and the classification for dimension $k &gt, 2$ is done in first main Theorem $\Omega$. Very Generic Normal systems (Definitions $[1.2,1.4]$) arise as coarse invariants during classification of very generic hyperplane arrangements (Definition $[1.7,1.8,1.12]$), that is, they classify very generic hyperplane arrangements modulo translation of any hyperplane (Theorem $1.16$, Note $1.17$). Theorem $\Omega$ in turn classifies the normal system associated to a hyperplane arrangement (Definition $1.14$) up to an isomorphism via its antipodal point arrangement. With one more invariant, the concurrency arrangement sign function (Definition $1.18$), we completely classify the isomorphism classes of very generic hyperplane arrangements over an ordered field in Section $8$ in second main Theorem $\Sigma$. Finally in last Section $9$ we pose open Question $9.1$ about normal systems.;math.CO
1801.09578;Quantum Markov processes on graphs, monitoring and hitting times;We make use of matrix representations of completely positive maps in order to study open quantum dynamics on graphs, with emphasis on quantum walks and the associated trajectories obtained via a monitoring of the position. We discuss the discrete and continuous time setting and consider the statistics of particles located on a vertex with some internal degree of freedom. Other classes of semigroup generators, such as graph-induced generators are also considered. In the case of primitive quantum channels we present expressions of the mean hitting time for a particle to reach a vertex in terms of a quantum version of the fundamental matrix, thus extending recent results in the setting of open quantum random walks. An open quantum version of Kac's Lemma for the expected return time is discussed. By considering appropriate block matrix expressions we are able to make computations in terms of matrix-valued transition rates, in analogy with the notion of rates from classical continuous-time Markov chains. Also inspired by the classical case a recurrence criterion for the continuous time open walk setting is presented.;math-ph
1801.09580;Ends and simple coarse structures;This paper is devoted to introducing coarse structures in a very simple way, namely as an equivalence relation on the set of simple ends. As an application we show that Gromov boundary of every hyperbolic space is an example of a Higson corona and each Freundenthal compactification is an example of a Higson compactification.;math.MG
1801.09583;Almost sure rates of mixing for random intermittent maps;We consider a family $\mathcal F$ of maps with two branches and a common neutral fixed point $0$ such that the order of tangency at $0$ belongs to some interval $[\alpha_0, \alpha_1]\subset (0, 1)$. Maps in $\mathcal F$ do not necessarily share a common Markov partition. At each step a member of $\mathcal F$ is chosen independently with respect to the uniform distribution on $[\alpha_0, \alpha_1]$. We show that the construction of the random tower in Bahsoun-Bose-Ruziboev \cite{BBR} with \emph{general return time} can be carried out for random compositions of such maps. Thus their general results are applicable and gives upper bounds for the quenched decay of correlations of form $n^{1-1/\alpha_0+\delta}$ for any $\delta&gt,0$.;math.DS
1801.09586;A note on a Griffiths-type ring for complete intersections in Grassmannians;We calculate a Griffiths-type ring for smooth complete intersection in Grassmannians. This is the analogue of the classical Jacobian ring for complete intersections in projective space, and allows us to explicitly compute their Hodge groups.;math.AG
1801.09587;Finite Nocommutative Coverings and Flat Connections;Any flat connection on a principal fibre bundle comes from a linear representation of the fundamental group. The noncommutative analog of this fact is discussed here.;math.OA
1801.09590;Reflective modular forms: A Jacobi forms approach;We give an explicit formula to express the weight of $2$-reflective modular forms. We prove that there is no $2$-reflective lattice of signature $(2,n)$ when $n\geq 15$ and $n\neq 19$ except the even unimodular lattices of signature $(2,18)$ and $(2,26)$. As applications, we give a simple proof of Looijenga's theorem that the lattice $2U\oplus 2E_8(-1)\oplus\langle -2n\rangle$ is not $2$-reflective if $n&gt,1$. We also classify reflective modular forms on lattices of large rank and the modular forms with the simplest reflective divisors.;math.NT
1801.09591;A note on expansion in prime fields;Let $\beta,\epsilon \in (0,1]$, and $k \geq \exp(122 \max\{1/\beta,1/\epsilon\})$. We prove that if $A,B$ are subsets of a prime field $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$, and $|B| \geq p^{\beta}$, then there exists a sum of the form $$S = a_{1}B \pm \ldots \pm a_{k}B, \qquad a_{1},\ldots,a_{k} \in A,$$ with $|S| \geq 2^{-12}p^{-\epsilon}\min\{|A||B|,p\}$. <br />As a corollary, we obtain an elementary proof of the following sum-product estimate. For every $\alpha &lt, 1$ and $\beta,\delta &gt, 0$, there exists $\epsilon &gt, 0$ such that the following holds. If $A,B,E \subset \mathbb{Z}_{p}$ satisfy $|A| \leq p^{\alpha}$, $|B| \geq p^{\beta}$, and $|B||E| \geq p^{\delta}|A|$, then there exists $t \in E$ such that $$|A + tB| \geq c p^{\epsilon}|A|,$$ for some absolute constant $c &gt, 0$. A sharper estimate, based on the polynomial method, follows from recent work of Stevens and de Zeeuw.;math.CO
1801.09593;Purity of Crystalline Strata;Let $p$ be a prime. Let $n\in\mathbb N-\{0\}$. Let $\mathcal C$ be an $F^n$-crystal over a locally noetherian $\mathbb F_p$-scheme $S$. Let $(a,b)\in\mathbb N^2$. We show that the reduced locally closed subscheme of $S$ whose points are exactly those $x\in S$ such that $(a,b)$ is a break point of the Newton polygon of the fiber $\mathcal C_x$ of $\mathcal C$ at $x$ is pure in $S$, i.e., it is an affine $S$-scheme. This result refines and reobtains previous results of de Jong--Oort, Vasiu, and Yang. As an application, we show that for all $m\in \mathbb N$ the reduced locally closed subscheme of $S$ whose points are exactly those $x\in S$ for which the $p$-rank of $\mathcal C_x$ is $m$ is pure in $S$, the case $n=1$ was previously obtained by Deligne (unpublished) and the general case $n\ge 1$ refines and reobtains a result of Zink.;math.AG
1801.09595;Ground states of some coupled nonlocal fractional dispersive PDEs;We show the existence of ground state solutions to the following stationary system coming from some coupled fractional dispersive equations such as: nonlinear fractional Schr\"odinger (NLFS) equations (for dimension $n=1,\, 2,\, 3$) or NLFS and fractional Korteweg-de Vries equations (for $n=1$), $$ \left \{ \begin{array}{ll} (-\Delta)^{s} u+ \lambda_1 u &amp,= u_1^{3}+\beta uv,\quad u\in W^{s,2}(\mathbb{R}^n), (-\Delta)^{s} v + \lambda_2 v &amp,= \frac 12 v^{2}+\frac 12 \beta u^2,\quad v\in W^{s,2}(\mathbb{R}^n), \end{array} \right. $$ where $\lambda_j&gt,0$, $j=1,2$, $\beta\in \mathbb{R}$, $n=1,\, 2,\, 3$, and $\frac n4&lt, s&lt,1$. Precisely, we prove the existence of a positive radially symmetric ground state for any $\beta&gt,0$.;math.AP
1801.09599;A Partial Order on Bipartitions From the Generalized Springer Correspondence;In \cite{Lusztig}, Lusztig gives an explicit formula for the bijection between the set of bipartitions and the set $\mathcal{N}$ of unipotent classes in a spin group which carry irreducible local systems equivariant for the spin group but not equivariant for the special orthogonal group. The set $\mathcal{N}$ has a natural partial order and therefore induces a partial order on bipartitions. We use the explicit formula given in \cite{Lusztig} to prove that this partial order on bipartitions is the same as the dominance order appeared in Dipper-James-Murphy's work.;math.RT
1801.09600;Asymptotics of Cheeger constants and unitarisability of groups;Given a group $\Gamma$, we establish a connection between the unitarisability of its uniformly bounded representations and the asymptotic behaviour of the isoperimetric constants of Cayley graphs of $\Gamma$ for increasingly large generating sets. <br />The connection hinges on an analytic invariant ${\rm Lit}(\Gamma)\in [0, \infty]$ which we call the \emph{Littlewood exponent}. Finiteness, amenability, unitarisability and the existence of free subgroups are related respectively to the thresholds $0, 1, 2$ and $\infty$ for ${\rm Lit}(\Gamma)$. Using graphical small cancellation theory, we prove that there exist groups $\Gamma$ for which $1&lt,{\rm Lit}(\Gamma)&lt,\infty$. Further applications, examples and problems are discussed.;math.FA
1801.09603;A BDF2-Approach for the Non-linear Fokker-Planck Equation;We prove convergence of a variational formulation of the BDF2 method applied to the non-linear Fokker-Planck equation. Our approach is inspired by the JKO-method and exploits the differential structure of the underlying $L^2$-Wasserstein space. The technique presented here extends and strengthens the results of our own recent work on the BDF2 method for general metric gradient flows in the special case of the non-linear Fokker-Planck equation: firstly, we do not require uniform semi-convexity of the augmented energy functional, secondly, we prove strong instead of merely weak convergence of the time-discrete approximations, thirdly, we directly prove without using the abstract theory of curves of maximal slope that the obtained limit curve is a weak solution of the non-linear Fokker-Planck equation.;math.NA
1801.09607;Second Order Asymptotic Properties for the Tail Probability of the Number of Customers in the M/G/1 Retrial Queue;When an explicit expression for a probability distribution function $F(x)$ can not be found, asymptotic properties of the tail probability function $\bar{F}(x)=1-F(x)$ are very valuable, since they provide approximations or bounds for system performance, and approaches for computing probability distribution. In this paper, we study tail asymptotic properties for the number of the customers in the $M/G/1$ retrial queueing system. For queueing systems, studies on asymptotic tails have mainly concentrated on the first order asymptotic behavior. To best our knowledge, there is no second order tail asymptotic analysis for retrial queueing models with heavy-tailed service time. Second order asymptotic expansions provide the refined asymptotic results from the first order approximation, and are often more difficult to obtain as expected. The main contribution of this paper is the second order asymptotic analysis for the $M/G/1$ retrial queue.;math.PR
1801.09608;Higher rank isomonodromic deformations and W-algebras;We construct the general solution of a class of Fuchsian systems of rank $N$ as well as the associated isomonodromic tau functions in terms of semi-degenerate conformal blocks of $W_N$-algebra with central charge $c=N-1$. The simplest example is given by the tau function of the Fuji-Suzuki-Tsuda system, expressed as a Fourier transform of the 4-point conformal block with respect to intermediate weight. Along the way, we generalize the result of Bowcock and Watts on the minimal set of matrix elements of vertex operators of the $W_N$-algebra for generic central charge and prove several properties of semi-degenerate vertex operators and conformal blocks for $c=N-1$.;math-ph
1801.09609;Extremal Collections of $k$-Uniform Vectors;We show any matrix of rank $r$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ can have $\leq \binom{r}{k}(q-1)^k$ distinct columns of weight $k$ if $ k \leq O_q(\sqrt{\log r})$ (up to divisibility issues), and $\leq \binom{r}{k}(q-1)^{r-k}$ distinct columns of co-weight $k$ if $k \leq O_q(r^{2/3})$. This shows the natural examples consisting of only $r$ rows are optimal for both, and the proofs will recover some form of uniqueness of these examples in all cases.;math.CO
1801.09610;Global Sobolev inequalities and Degenerate P-Laplacian equations;We prove that a local, weak Sobolev inequality implies a global Sobolev estimate using existence and regularity results for a family of $p$-Laplacian equations. Given $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, let $\rho$ be a quasi-metric on $\Omega$, and let $Q$ be an $n\times n$ semi-definite matrix function defined on $\Omega$. For an open set $\Theta\Subset\Omega$, we give sufficient conditions to show that if the local weak Sobolev inequality % \[ \Big(\fint_B <br />|f|^{p\sigma}dx\Big)^\frac{1}{p\sigma} \leq C\Big[ r(B)\fint_B <br />|\sqrt{Q}\nabla f|^pdx + \fint_B <br />|f|^pdx\Big]^\frac{1}{p} \] holds for some $\sigma&gt,1$, all balls $B\subset \Theta$, and functions $f\in Lip_0(\Theta)$, then the global Sobolev inequality \[ \Big(\int_\Theta <br />|f|^{p\sigma}dx\Big)^\frac{1}{p\sigma} \leq C\Big(\int_\Theta <br />|\sqrt{Q}\nabla f(x)|^pdx\Big)^\frac{1}{p} \] also holds. Central to our proof is showing the existence and boundedness of solutions of the Dirichlet problem \[ \begin{cases} \mx_{p,\tau} u &amp, = \varphi \text{in} \Theta \\ u &amp, = 0 \text{in} \partial \Theta, \end{cases} \] where $\mx_{p,\tau}$ is a degenerate $p$-Laplacian operator with a zero order term: \[ \mx_{p,\tau} u = \text{div}\Big(\big|\sqrt{Q} \nabla u\big|^{p-2}Q\nabla u\Big) - \tau |u|^{p-2}u. \];math.AP
1801.09613;Scattering invariants in Euler&#x27,s two-center problem;The problem of two fixed centers was introduced by Euler as early as in 1760. It plays an important role both in celestial mechanics and in the microscopic world. In the present paper we study the spatial problem in the case of arbitrary (both positive and negative) strengths of the centers. Combining techniques from scattering theory and Liouville integrability, we show that this spatial problem has topologically non-trivial scattering dynamics, which we identify as scattering monodromy. The approach that we introduce in this paper applies more generally to scattering systems that are integrable in the Liouville sense.;math-ph
1801.09622;First-Order Least-Squares Method for the Obstacle Problem;We define and analyse a least-squares finite element method for a first-order reformulation of the obstacle problem. Moreover, we derive variational inequalities that are based on similar but non-symmetric bilinear forms. A priori error estimates including the case of non-conforming convex sets are given and optimal convergence rates are shown for the lowest-order case. We provide also a posteriori bounds that can be be used as error indicators in an adaptive algorithm. Numerical studies are presented.;math.NA

1801.09628;Secure Massive IoT Using Hierarchical Fast Blind Deconvolution;The Internet of Things and specifically the Tactile Internet give rise to significant challenges for notions of security. In this work, we introduce a novel concept for secure massive access. The core of our approach is a fast and low-complexity blind deconvolution algorithm exploring a bi-linear and hierarchical compressed sensing framework. We show that blind deconvolution has two appealing features: 1) There is no need to coordinate the pilot signals, so even in the case of collisions in user activity, the information messages can be resolved. 2) Since all the individual channels are recovered in parallel, and by assumed channel reciprocity, the measured channel entropy serves as a common secret and is used as an encryption key for each user. We will outline the basic concepts underlying the approach and describe the blind deconvolution algorithm in detail. Eventually, simulations demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to recover both channel and message. They also exhibit the inherent trade-offs of the scheme between economical recovery and secret capacity.;cs.IT
1801.09629;Algebraic Construction of Quasi-split Algebraic Tori;The main purpose of this work is to give a constructive proof for a particular case of the no-name lemma. Let $G$ be a finite group, $K$ be a field, $L$ be a permutation $G$-lattice and $K[L]$ be the group algebra of $L$ over $K$. The no-name lemma asserts that the invariant field of the quotient field of $K[L]$, $K(L)^G$ is a purely transcendental extension of $K^G$. In other words, there exist $y_1, \ldots , y_n$ which are algebraically independent over $K^G$ such that $K(L)^G \cong K^G(y_1, \ldots , y_n)$. We define elements $\lbrace y_1, \ldots, y_n \rbrace \subset K[L]^G$ with the desired properties, in the case when $G$ is the Galois group of a finite extension $\mathrm{Gal}(K/F)$, and $L$ is a sign permutation $G$-lattice.;math.AG
1801.09634;Parameter Estimation, Sensitivity Analysis and Optimal Control of a Periodic Epidemic Model with Application to HRSV in Florida;A state wide Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (HRSV) surveillance system was implemented in Florida in 1999 to support clinical decision-making for prophylaxis of premature infants. The research presented in this paper addresses the problem of fitting real data collected by the Florida HRSV surveillance system by using a periodic SEIRS mathematical model. A sensitivity and cost-effectiveness analysis of the model is done and an optimal control problem is formulated and solved with treatment as the control variable.;math.OC
1801.09635;The Functional Method for the Domain-Wall Partition Function;We review the (algebraic-)functional method devised by Galleas and further developed by Galleas and the author. We first explain the method using the simplest example: the computation of the partition function for the six-vertex model with domain-wall boundary conditions. At the heart of the method lies a linear functional equation for the partition function. After deriving this equation we outline its analysis. The result is a closed expression in the form of a symmetrized sum - or, equivalently, multiple-integral formula - that can be rewritten to recover Izergin's determinant. Special attention is paid to the relation with other approaches. In particular we show that the Korepin--Izergin approach can be recovered within the functional method. We comment on the functional method's range of applicability, and review how it is adapted to the technically more involved example of the elliptic solid-on-solid model with domain walls and a reflecting end. We present a new formula for the partition function of the latter, which was expressed as a determinant by Tsuchiya--Filali--Kitanine. Our result takes the form of a 'crossing-symmetrized' sum with $2^L$ terms featuring the elliptic domain-wall partition function, which appears to be new also in the limiting case of the six-vertex model. Further taking the rational limit we recover the expression obtained by Frassek using the boundary perimeter Bethe ansatz.;math-ph
1801.09640;True value of an integral in Gradshteyn and Ryzhik&#x27,s table;Victor Moll pointed out that entry 3.248.5 in the sixth edition of Gradshteyn and Ryzhik tables of integrals was incorrect. He asked some years ago what was the true value of this integral. I evaluate it in terms of two elliptic integrals. The evaluation is standard but involved, using real and complex analysis. I prove $$\int_0^{\infty}\frac{dx}{(1+x^2)^{3/2}[\varphi(x)+\sqrt{\varphi(x)}]^{1/2}}= \frac{\sqrt{3}-1}{\sqrt{2}}\Pi(\pi/2,k,3^{-1/2})-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}F(\alpha, 3^{-1/2}),$$ where $\varphi(x)=1+4x^2/2(1+x^2)^2$, $k=2-\sqrt{3}$, $\alpha=\arcsin\sqrt{k}$ and $F(\varphi,k)$, $\Pi(\varphi,n^2,k)$ the elliptic integrals of the first and third kind respectively.;math.CA
1801.09641;The K&#xe4,hler geometry of Bott manifolds;We study the K\"ahler geometry of stage n Bott manifolds, which can be viewed as $n$-dimensional generalizations of Hirzebruch surfaces. We show, using a simple induction argument and the generalized Calabi construction from [ACGT04,ACGT11], that any stage n Bott manifold $M_n$ admits an extremal K\"ahler metric. We also give necessary conditions for $M_n$ to admit a constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metric. We obtain more precise results for stage 3 Bott manifolds, including in particular some interesting relations with c-projective geometry and some explicit examples of almost K\"ahler structures. <br />To place these results in context, we review and develop the topology, complex geometry and symplectic geometry of Bott manifolds. In particular, we study the K\"ahler cone, the automorphism group and the Fano condition. We also relate the number of conjugacy classes of maximal tori in the symplectomorphism group to the number of biholomorphism classes compatible with the symplectic structure.;math.DG
1801.09644;$&#x3c3,$-locales and Booleanization in Formal Topology;A $\sigma$-frame is a poset with countable joins and finite meets in which binary meets distribute over countable joins. Aim of this paper is to show that $\sigma$-frames, actually $\sigma$-locales, can be seen as a branch of Formal Topology, that is, intuitionistic and predicative pointfree topology. Every $\sigma$-frame $L$ is the lattice of Lindel\"of elements (those for which each of their covers admits a countable subcover) of a formal topology of a specific kind which, in its turn, is a presentation of the free frame over $L$. We then give a constructive characterization of the smallest (strongly) dense $\sigma$-sublocale of a given $\sigma$-locale, thus providing a "$\sigma$-version" of a Boolean locale.;math.LO
1801.09647;Controllability, matching ratio and graph convergence;There is an important parameter in control theory which is closely related to the directed matching ratio of the network, as shown by Liu, Slotine and Barab\'asi (2011). We give proofs on two main statements of that paper on the directed matching ratio, which were based on numerical results and heuristics from statistical physics. First, we show that the directed matching ratio of directed random networks given by a fix sequence of degrees is concentrated around its mean. We also examine the convergence of the (directed) matching ratio of a random (directed) graph sequence that converges in the local weak sense, and generalize the result of Elek and Lippner (2009). We prove that the mean of the directed matching ratio converges to the properly defined matching ratio parameter of the limiting graph. We further show the almost sure convergence of the matching ratios for the most widely used families of scale-free networks, which was the main motivation of Liu, Slotine and Barab\'asi.;math.PR
1801.09648;Global Stability for Charged Scalar Fields in an Asymptotically Flat Metric in Harmonic Gauge;We prove global stability for the Charge-Scalar Field system on a background metric which is close to 1+3-dimensional Minkowski space. In particular, we consider a class of background metrics which satisfy certain estimates consistent with the behavior of small-data solutions to Einstein's Vacuum Equations in harmonic coordinates. Our results are analogous to results obtained in Minkowski space by Lindblad and Sterbenz. The proof relies on a single-parameter modification of the standard Lorentz fields which depends on the mass associated with the metric.;math.AP
1801.09649;A multi-scale limit of a randomly forced rotating $3$-D compressible fluid;We study a singular limit of a scaled compressible Navier--Stokes--Coriolis system driven by both a deterministic and stochastic forcing terms in three dimensions. If the Mach number is comparable to the Froude number with both proportional to say $\varepsilon\ll 1$, whereas the Rossby number scales like $\varepsilon^m$ for $m&gt,1$ large, then we show that any family of weak martingale solution to the $3$-D randomly forced rotating compressible equation (under the influence of a deterministic centrifugal force) converges in probability, as $\varepsilon\rightarrow0$, to the $2$-D incompressible Navier--Stokes system with a corresponding random forcing term.;math.AP
1801.09653;Stable day-to-day dynamics for departure time choice;In this paper we present a stable day-to-day dynamical system for drivers' departure time choice at a single bottleneck. We first define within-day traffic dynamics with the point queue model, costs, the departure time user equilibrium (DTUE), and the arrival time user equilibrium (ATUE). We then identify three behavioral principles: (i) Drivers choose their departure and arrival times in a backward fashion (backward choice principle), (ii) After choosing the arrival times, they update their departure times to balance the total costs (cost balancing principle), (iii) They choose their arrival times to reduce their scheduling costs or gain their scheduling payoffs (scheduling cost reducing or scheduling payoff gaining principle). In this sense, drivers' departure and arrival time choices are driven by their scheduling payoff choice. With a single tube or imaginary road model, we convert the nonlocal day-to-day arrival time shifting problem to a local scheduling payoff shifting problem. After introducing a new variable for the imaginary density, we apply the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model to describe the day-to-day dynamics of scheduling payoff choice and present splitting and cost balancing schemes to determine arrival and departure flow-rates accordingly. We also develop the corresponding discrete models for numerical solutions. We theoretically prove that the day-to-day stationary state of the LWR model leads to the scheduling payoff user equilibrium (SPUE), which is equivalent to both DTUE and ATUE and stable. We use one numerical example to demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of the new day-to-day dynamical model.;math.OC
1801.09657;Matrix Completion for Structured Observations;The need to predict or fill-in missing data, often referred to as matrix completion, is a common challenge in today's data-driven world. Previous strategies typically assume that no structural difference between observed and missing entries exists. Unfortunately, this assumption is woefully unrealistic in many applications. For example, in the classic Netflix challenge, in which one hopes to predict user-movie ratings for unseen films, the fact that the viewer has not watched a given movie may indicate a lack of interest in that movie, thus suggesting a lower rating than otherwise expected. We propose adjusting the standard nuclear norm minimization strategy for matrix completion to account for such structural differences between observed and unobserved entries by regularizing the values of the unobserved entries. We show that the proposed method outperforms nuclear norm minimization in certain settings.;math.NA
1801.09659;A geometric model for the derived category of gentle algebras;In this paper, we construct a geometric model for the bounded derived category of a gentle algebra. The construction is based on the ribbon graph associated to a gentle algebra by the third author, and is linked to partially wrapped Fukaya categories by the work of Haiden, Katzarkov and Kontsevich and to derived categories of coherent sheaves on nodal stacky curves by the work of Lekili and Polishchuk. The ribbon graph gives rise to an oriented surface with boundary and marked points in the boundary. We show that the homotopy classes of curves connecting marked points and of closed curves are in bijection with the isomorphism classes of indecomposable objects in the bounded derived category of the gentle algebra. Intersections of curves correspond to morphisms and resolving the crossings of curves gives rise to mapping cones. The Auslander-Reiten translate corresponds to rotating endpoints of curves along the boundary. Furthermore, we show that the surface encodes the derived invariant of Avella-Alaminos and Geiss.;math.RT
1801.09665;Cooperative repair: Constructions of optimal MDS codes for all admissible parameters;Two widely studied models of multiple-node repair in distributed storage systems are centralized repair and cooperative repair. The centralized model assumes that all the failed nodes are recreated in one location, while the cooperative one stipulates that the failed nodes may communicate but are distinct, and the amount of data exchanged between them is included in the repair bandwidth. <br />As our first result, we prove a lower bound on the minimum bandwidth of cooperative repair. We also show that the cooperative model is stronger than the centralized one, in the sense that any MDS code with optimal repair bandwidth under the former model also has optimal bandwidth under the latter one. These results were previously known under the additional "uniform download" assumption, which is removed in our proofs. <br />As our main result, we give explicit constructions of MDS codes with optimal cooperative repair for all possible parameters. More precisely, given any $n,k,h,d$ such that $2\le h \le n-d\le n-k$ we construct $(n,k)$ MDS codes over the field $F$ of size $|F|\ge (d+1-k)n$ that can optimally repair any $h$ erasures from any $d$ helper nodes. The repair scheme of our codes involves two rounds of communication. In the first round, each failed node downloads information from the helper nodes, and in the second one, each failed node downloads additional information from the other failed nodes. This implies that our codes achieve the optimal repair bandwidth using the smallest possible number of rounds.;cs.IT
1801.09666;Involutions of rank 2 Higgs bundle moduli spaces;We consider the moduli space of rank 2 Higgs bundles with fixed determinant over a smooth projective curve X of genus 2 over the complex numbers, and study involutions defined by tensoring the vector bundle with an element $\alpha$ of order 2 in the Jacobian of the curve, combined with multiplication of the Higgs field by $\pm 1$. We describe the fixed points of these involutions in terms of the Prym variety of the covering of $X$ defined by $\alpha$, and give an interpretation in terms of the moduli space of representations of the fundamental group.;math.AG
1801.09679;The Lyapunov dimension, convergency and entropy for a dynamical model of Chua memristor circuit;For the study of chaotic dynamics and dimension of attractors the concepts of the Lyapunov exponents was found useful and became widely spread. Such characteristics of chaotic behavior, as the Lyapunov dimension and the entropy rate, can be estimated via the Lyapunov exponents. In this work an analytical approach to the study of the Lyapunov dimension, convergency and entropy for a dynamical model of Chua memristor circuit is demonstrated.;math.DS
1801.09716;The structure of doubly non-commuting isometries;Suppose that $n\geq 1$ and that, for all $i$ and $j$ with $1\leq i,j\leq n$ and $i\neq j$, $z_{ij}\in{\mathbb T}$ are given such that $z_{ji}=\overline{z}_{ij}$ for all $i\neq j$. If $V_1,\dotsc, V_n$ are isometries on a Hilbert space such that $V_i^\ast V_j^{\phantom{\ast}}\!=\overline{z}_{ij} V_j^{\phantom{\ast}}\!V_i^\ast$ for all $i\neq j$, then $(V_1,\dotsc,V_n)$ is called an $n$-tuple of doubly non-commuting isometries. The generators of non-commutative tori are well-known examples. In this paper, we establish a simultaneous Wold decomposition for $(V_1,\dotsc,V_n)$. This decomposition enables us to classify such $n$-tuples up to unitary equivalence. We show that the joint listing of a unitary equivalence class of a representation of each of the $2^n$ non-commutative tori that are naturally associated with the structure constants is a classifying invariant. A dilation theorem is also established, showing that an $n$-tuple of doubly non-commuting isometries can be extended to an $n$-tuple of doubly non-commuting unitary operators on an enveloping Hilbert space.;math.OA
1801.09733;Semi-Fredholm and semi-Browder spectrums for the $&#x3b1,$-times integrated semigroups;In this paper, we describe the different spectrums of the {\alpha}-times integrated semigroups by the spectrums of their generators. Specially, essential ascent and descent, upper and lower semi-Fredholm and semi-Browder spectrums.;math.FA
1801.09735;On Bott-Morse Foliations and their Poisson Structures in Dimension 3;We show that a Bott-Morse foliation in dimension 3 admits a linear, singular, Poisson structure of rank 2 with Bott-Morse singularities. We provide the Poisson bivectors for each type of singular component, and compute the symplectic forms of the characteristic distribution.;math.SG
1801.09736;Boundary elements with mesh refinements for the wave equation;The solution of the wave equation in a polyhedral domain in $\mathbb{R}^3$ admits an asymptotic singular expansion in a neighborhood of the corners and edges. In this article we formulate boundary and screen problems for the wave equation as equivalent boundary integral equations in time domain, study the regularity properties of their solutions and the numerical approximation. Guided by the theory for elliptic equations, graded meshes are shown to recover the optimal approximation rates known for smooth solutions. Numerical experiments illustrate the theory for screen problems. In particular, we discuss the Dirichlet and Neumann problems, as well as the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator and applications to the sound emission of tires.;math.NA
1801.09743;Quasi-Fredholm, Saphar Spectra for Integrated Semigroup;In this paper, we show a spectral inclusion of integrated semigroups for Saphar, essentially Saphar and quasi-Fredholm spectra.;math.FA
1801.09745;The spectrum of the Schr&#xf6,dinger Hamiltonian for trapped particles in a cylinder with a topological defect perturbed by two attractive delta interactions;In this paper we exploit the technique used in \cite{A}-\cite{5b} to deal with delta interactions in a rigorous way in a curved spacetime represented by a cosmic string along the $z$ axis. This mathematical machinery is applied in order to study the discrete spectrum of a point-mass particle confined in an infinitely long cylinder with a conical defect on the $z$ axis and perturbed by two identical attractive delta interactions symmetrically situated around the origin. We derive a suitable approximate formula for the total energy. As a consequence, we found the existence of a mixing of states with positive or zero energy with the ones with negative energy (bound states). This mixture depends on the radius $R$ of the trapping cylinder. The number of quantum bound states is an increasing function of the radius $R$. It is also interesting to note the presence of states with zero total energy (quasi free states). Apart from the gravitational background, the model presented in this paper is of interest in the context of nanophysics and graphene modeling. In particular, the graphene with double layer in this framework, with the double layer given by the aforementioned delta interactions and the string on the $z-$axis modeling topological defects connecting the two layers. As a consequence of these setups, we obtain the usual mixture of positive and negative bound states present in the graphene literature.;math-ph
1801.09748;Stability of Periodic Travelling Flexural-Gravity Waves in Two Dimensions;In this work, we solve the Euler's equations for periodic waves travelling under a sheet of ice using a reformulation introduced in Ablowitz et al. (2006). These waves are referred to as flexural-gravity waves. We compare and contrast two models for the effect of the ice: a linear model and a nonlinear model. The benefit of this reformulation is that it facilitates the asymptotic analysis. We use it to derive the nonlinear Schrodinger equation that describes the modulational instability of periodic travelling waves. We compare this asymptotic result with numerical computation of stability using the Fourier-Floquet-Hill method and show how well these agree. We show that different models have different stability regimes for large values of the flexural rigidity parameter. Numerical computations are used to go beyond the modulational instability and show high frequency instabilities that are the same for both models for ice in the regime examined.;math.AP
1801.09752;Problem of Descent Spectrum Equality;Let $\mathcal{B}(X)$ be the algebra of all bounded operators acting on an infinite dimensional complex Banach space $X$. We say that an operator $T \in \mathcal{B}(X)$ satisfies the problem of descent spectrum equality, if the descent spectrum of $T$ as an operator coincides with the descent spectrum of $T$ as an element of the algebra of all bounded linear operators on $X$. In this paper we are interested in the problem of descent spectrum equality . Specifically, the problem is to consider the following question: Let $T \in \mathcal{B}(X)$ such that $\sigma(T)$ has non empty interior, under which condition on $T$ does $\sigma_{desc}(T)=\sigma_{desc}(T, \mathcal{B}(X))$ ?;math.SP
1801.09756;Counterexamples in Calculus of Variations in $L^\infty$ through the vectorial Eikonal equation;We show that for any regular bounded domain $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb R^n$, $n=2,3$, there exist infinitely many global diffeomorphisms equal to the identity on $\partial \Omega$ which solve the Eikonal equation. We also provide explicit examples of such maps on annular domains. This implies that the $\infty$-Laplace system arising in vectorial Calculus of Variations in $L^\infty$ does not suffice to characterise either limits of $p$-Harmonic maps as $p\to \infty$, or absolute minimisers in the sense of Aronsson.;math.AP
1801.09764;Essential Descent Spectrum Equality;A bounded operator $T$ in a Banach space $X$ is said to satisfy the essential descent spectrum equality, if the descent spectrum of $T$ as an operator on $X$ coincides with the essential descent spectrum of $T$. In this note, we give some conditions under which the equality $\sigma_{desc}(T) = \sigma^e_{desc}(T)$ holds for a single operator $T$.;math.SP
1801.09766;Couniversal spaces which are equivariant commutative ring spectra;The note identifies which which couniversal spaces have suspension spectra equivalent to commutative orthogonal ring G-spectra for a compact Lie group G. These are precisely those whose cofamily is closed under passage to finite index subgroups. Equivalently these are the couniversal spaces admitting an action of an equivariant E infinity operad.;math.AT
1801.09767;What Is the Fractional Laplacian?;The fractional Laplacian in R^d has multiple equivalent characterizations. Moreover, in bounded domains, boundary conditions must be incorporated in these characterizations in mathematically distinct ways, and there is currently no consensus in the literature as to which definition of the fractional Laplacian in bounded domains is most appropriate for a given application. The Riesz (or integral) definition, for example, admits a nonlocal boundary condition, where the value of a function u(x) must be prescribed on the entire exterior of the domain in order to compute its fractional Laplacian. In contrast, the spectral definition requires only the standard local boundary condition. These differences, among others, lead us to ask the question: "What is the fractional Laplacian?" We compare several commonly used definitions of the fractional Laplacian (the Riesz, spectral, directional, and horizon-based nonlocal definitions), and we use a joint theoretical and computational approach to examining their different characteristics by studying solutions of related fractional Poisson equations formulated on bounded domains. <br />In this work, we provide new numerical methods as well as a self-contained discussion of state-of-the-art methods for discretizing the fractional Laplacian, and we present new results on the differences in features, regularity, and boundary behaviors of solutions to equations posed with these different definitions. We present stochastic interpretations and demonstrate the equivalence between some recent formulations. Through our efforts, we aim to further engage the research community in open problems and assist practitioners in identifying the most appropriate definition and computational approach to use for their mathematical models in addressing anomalous transport in diverse applications.;math.NA
1801.09778;Diffeomorphic registration of discrete geometric distributions;This paper proposes a new framework and algorithms to address the problem of diffeomorphic registration on a general class of geometric objects that can be described as discrete distributions of local direction vectors. It builds on both the large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) model and the concept of oriented varifolds introduced in previous works like [Kaltenmark 2017]. Unlike previous approaches in which varifold representations are only used as surrogates to define and evaluate fidelity terms, the specificity of this paper is to derive direct deformation models and corresponding matching algorithms for discrete varifolds. We show that it gives on the one hand an alternative numerical setting for curve and surface matching but that it can also handle efficiently more general shape structures, including multi-directional objects or multi-modal images represented as distributions of unit gradient vectors.;math.OC
1801.09786;An Algorithm to Decompose Permutation Representations of Finite Groups: Polynomial Algebra Approach;We describe an algorithm for splitting permutation representations of finite group over fields of characteristic zero into irreducible components. The algorithm is based on the fact that the components of the invariant inner product in invariant subspaces are operators of projection into these subspaces. An important element of the algorithm is the calculation of Gr\"obner bases of polynomial ideals. A preliminary implementation of the algorithm splits representations up to dimensions of tens of thousands. Some examples of computations are given in appendix.;math.RT
1801.09787;Kaleidoscopic groups: permutation groups constructed from dendrite homeomorphisms;Given a transitive permutation group, a fundamental object for studying its higher transitivity properties is the permutation action of its isotropy subgroup. We reverse this relationship and introduce a universal construction of infinite permutation groups that takes as input a given system of imprimitivity for its isotropy subgroup. <br />This produces vast families kaleidoscopic groups. We investigate their algebraic properties, such as simplicity and oligomorphy, their homological properties, such as acyclicity or contrariwise large Schur multipliers, their topological properties, such as unique polishability. <br />Our construction is carried out within the framework of homeomorphism groups of topological dendrites.;math.GR
1801.09789;Preserving of the unconditional basis property under non-self-adjoint perturbations of self-adjoint operators;Let $T$ be a self-adjoint operator in a Hilbert space $H$ with domain $\mathcal D(T)$. Assume that the spectrum of $T$ is confined in the union of disjoint intervals $\Delta_k =[\alpha_{2k-1},\alpha_{2k}]$, $k\in \mathbb{Z}$, and $$ \alpha_{2k+1}-\alpha_{2k} \geq b|\alpha_{2k+1}+\alpha_{2k}|^p\quad \text{ for some }\,b&gt,0,\,p\in[0,1). $$ Suppose that a linear operator $B$ in $H$ is $p$-subordinated to $T$, i.e. $\mathcal D(B) \supset\mathcal D(T)$ and $\|Bx\| \leq b'\,\|Tx\|^p\|x\|^{1-p} +M\|x\| \text{\, for all } x\in \mathcal D(T)$, with some $b'&gt,0$ and $M\geq 0$. Then the spectrum of the perturbed operator $A=T+B$ lies in the union of a rectangle in $\mathbb{C}$ and double parabola $P_{p,h} = \bigl\{\lambda \in \mathbb{C}\,\bigl|\,|\mathop{\rm Im} \lambda|\leq h|\mathop{\rm Re} \lambda|^p\bigr\}$, provided that $h&gt,b'$. The vertical strips $\Omega_k =\{\lambda\in\mathbb{C}|\,|r_k-{\rm Re}\,\lambda|\leq \delta r_k^p\}$, $r_k =(\alpha_{2k}+\alpha_{2k+1})/2$, belong to the resolvent set of $T$, provided that $\delta &lt,b -b'$ and $ |k|\geq N$ for $N$ large enough. For $|k|\ge N+1$, denote by $\Pi_k$ the curvilinear trapezoid formed by the lines ${\rm Re}\,\lambda = r_{k-1}$, ${\rm Re}\,\lambda = r_{k}$, and the boundary of the parabola $P_{p,h}$. Assume that $Q_0$ is the Riesz projection corresponding to the (bounded) part of the spectrum of $T$ that lies outside $\bigcup_{|k|\geq N+1}\Pi_k$. And let $Q_k$, $|k|\ge N+1$, be the Riesz projection for the part of the spectrum of $T$ confined within $\Pi_k$. Main result of the work consists in proving that the system of the invariant subspaces $Q_k(H)$, $|k|\geq N+1$, together with the invariant subspace $Q_0(H)$ forms an unconditional basis of subspaces in the space $H$.;math.SP
1801.09792;Time domain boundary elements for dynamic contact problems;This article considers a unilateral contact problem for the wave equation. The problem is reduced to a variational inequality for the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator for the wave equation on the boundary, which is solved in a saddle point formulation using boundary elements in the time domain. As a model problem, also a variational inequality for the single layer operator is considered. A priori estimates are obtained for Galerkin approximations both to the variational inequality and the mixed formulation in the case of a flat contact area, where the existence of solutions to the continuous problem is known. Numerical experiments demonstrate the performance of the proposed mixed method. They indicate the stability and convergence beyond flat geometries.;math.NA
1801.09793;K&#xe4,hler fibrations in quantum information theory;We discuss the fibre bundle of co-adjoint orbits of compact Lie groups, and show how it admits a compatible K\"ahler structure. The case of the unitary group allows us to reformulate the geometric framework of quantum information theory. In particular, we show that the Fisher information tensor gives rise to a structure that is sufficiently close to a K\"ahler structure to generalise some classical result on co-adjoint orbits.;math-ph
1801.09796;Communication-Efficient Search for an Approximate Closest Lattice Point;We consider the problem of finding the closest lattice point to a vector in n-dimensional Euclidean space when each component of the vector is available at a distinct node in a network. Our objectives are (i) minimize the communication cost and (ii) obtain the error probability. The approximate closest lattice point considered here is the one obtained using the nearest-plane (Babai) algorithm. Assuming a triangular special basis for the lattice, we develop communication-efficient protocols for computing the approximate lattice point and determine the communication cost for lattices of dimension n&gt,1. Based on available parameterizations of reduced bases, we determine the error probability of the nearest plane algorithm for two dimensional lattices analytically, and present a computational error estimation algorithm in three dimensions. For dimensions 2 and 3, our results show that the error probability increases with the packing density of the lattice.;cs.IT
1801.09799;Matrix Completion for Low-Observability Voltage Estimation;With the rising penetration of distributed energy resources, distribution system control and enabling techniques such as state estimation have become essential to distribution system operation. However, traditional state estimation techniques have difficulty coping with the low-observability conditions often present on the distribution system due to the paucity of sensors and heterogeneity of measurements. To address these limitations, we propose a distribution system state estimation algorithm that employs matrix completion (a tool for estimating missing values in low-rank matrices) augmented with noise-resilient power flow constraints. This method operates under low-observability conditions where standard least-squares-based methods cannot operate, and flexibly incorporates any network quantities measured in the field. We empirically evaluate our method on the IEEE 33- and 123-bus test systems, and find that it provides near-perfect state estimation performance (within 1\% mean absolute percent error) across many low-observability data availability regimes.;math.OC
1801.09800;Reducing triangular systems of ODEs with rational coefficients, with applications to coupled Regge-Wheeler equations;We concisely summarize a method of finding all rational solutions to an inhomogeneous rational ODE system of arbitrary order (but solvable for its highest order terms) by converting it into a finite dimensional linear algebra problem. This method is then used to solve the problem of conclusively deciding when certain rational ODE systems in upper triangular form can or cannot be reduced to diagonal form by differential operators with rational coefficients. As specific examples, we consider systems of coupled Regge-Wheeler equations, which have naturally appeared in previous work on vector and tensor perturbations on the Schwarzschild black hole spacetime.

1801.09806;A proof of Jones&#x27, conjecture;In this paper, we prove that Wright's equation $y'(t) = - \alpha y(t-1) \{1 + y(t)\}$ has a unique slowly oscillating periodic solution for parameter values $\alpha \in (\tfrac{\pi}{2}, 1.9]$, up to time translation. This result proves Jones' Conjecture formulated in 1962, that there is a unique slowly oscillating periodic orbit for all $ \alpha &gt, \tfrac{\pi}{2}$. Furthermore, there are no isolas of periodic solutions to Wright's equation, all periodic orbits arise from Hopf bifurcations.;math.DS
1801.09813;Subgraph counts for dense random graphs with specified degrees;We prove two estimates for the expectation of the exponential of a complex function of a random permutation or subset. Using this theory, we find asymptotic expressions for the expected number of copies and induced copies of a given graph in a uniformly random graph with degree sequence $(d_1,\ldots,d_n)$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. We also determine the expected number of spanning trees in this model. The range of degrees covered includes $d_j = \lambda n + O(n^{1/2+\varepsilon})$ for some $\lambda$ bounded away from $0$ and $1$.;math.CO
1801.09815;A brief survey on singularities of geodesic flows in smooth signature changing metrics on 2-surfaces;We present a survey on generic singularities of geodesic flows in smooth signature changing metrics (often called pseudo-Riemannian) in dimension 2. Generically, a pseudo-Riemannian metric on a 2-manifold $S$ changes its signature (degenerates) along a curve $S_0$, which locally separates $S$ into a Riemannian ($R$) and a Lorentzian ($L$) domain. The geodesic flow does not have singularities over $R$ and $L$, and for any point $q \in R \cup L$ and every tangential direction $p$ there exists a unique geodesic passing through the point $q$ with the direction $p$. On the contrary, geodesics cannot pass through a point $q \in S_0$ in arbitrary tangential directions, but only in some admissible directions, the number of admissible directions is 1 or 2 or 3. We study this phenomenon and the local properties of geodesics near $q \in S_0$.;math.DG
1801.09817;Model-assisted inference for treatment effects using regularized calibrated estimation with high-dimensional data;Consider the problem of estimating average treatment effects when a large number of covariates are used to adjust for possible confounding through outcome regression and propensity score models. The conventional approach of model building and fitting iteratively can be difficult to implement, depending on ad hoc choices of what variables are included. In addition, uncertainty from the iterative process of model selection is complicated and often ignored in subsequent inference about treatment effects. We develop new methods and theory to obtain not only doubly robust point estimators for average treatment effects, which remain consistent if either the propensity score model or the outcome regression model is correctly specified, but also model-assisted confidence intervals, which are valid when the propensity score model is correctly specified but the outcome regression model may be misspecified. With a linear outcome model, the confidence intervals are doubly robust, that is, being also valid when the outcome model is correctly specified but the propensity score model may be misspecified. Our methods involve regularized calibrated estimators with Lasso penalties, but carefully chosen loss functions, for fitting propensity score and outcome regression models. We provide high-dimensional analysis to establish the desired properties of our methods under comparable conditions to previous results, which give valid confidence intervals when both the propensity score and outcome regression are correctly specified. We present a simulation study and an empirical application which confirm the advantages of the proposed methods compared with related methods based on regularized maximum likelihood estimation.;math.ST
1801.09818;On the crossroads of enumerative geometry and geometric representation theory;The subjects in the title are interwoven in many different and very deep ways. I recently wrote several expository accounts [64-66] that reflect a certain range of developments, but even in their totality they cannot be taken as a comprehensive survey. In the format of a 30-page contribution aimed at a general mathematical audience, I have decided to illustrate some of the basic ideas in one very interesting example - that of HilbpC2, nq, hoping to spark the curiosity of colleagues in those numerous fields of study where one should expect applications.;math.RT
1801.09820;A consequence of the growth of rotation sets for families of diffeomorphisms of the torus;In this paper we consider $C^\infty $-generic families of area-preserving diffeomorphisms of the torus homotopic to the identity and their rotation sets. Let $f_t:\rm{T^2\rightarrow T^2}$ be such a family, $\widetilde{f}_t:\rm I\negthinspace R^2 \rightarrow \rm I\negthinspace R^2$ be a fixed family of lifts and $\rho (\widetilde{f}_t)$ be their rotation sets, which we assume to have interior for $t$ in a certain open interval $I.$ We also assume that some rational point $(\frac pq,\frac rq)\in \partial \rho (\widetilde{f}_{\overline{t}})$ for a certain parameter $\overline{t}\in I$ and we want to understand consequences of the following hypothesis: For all $t&gt,\overline{t},$ $t\in I,$ $(\frac pq,\frac rq)\in int(\partial \rho (\widetilde{f}_t)).$ <br />Under these very natural assumptions, we prove that there exists a $f_{\overline{t}}^q$-fixed hyperbolic saddle $P_{\overline{t}}$ such that its rotation vector is $(\frac pq,\frac rq)$ and, there exists a sequence $t_i&gt,\overline{t},$ $t_i\rightarrow \overline{t},$ such that if $P_t$ is the continuation of $P_{\overline{t}}$ with the parameter, then $W^u(\widetilde{P}_{t_i})$ (the unstable manifold) has quadratic tangencies with $W^s(\widetilde{P}_{t_i})+(c,d)$ (the stable manifold translated by $(c,d)),$ where $\widetilde{P}_{t_i}$ is any lift of $P_{t_i}$ to the plane, in other words, $\widetilde{P}_{t_i}$ is a fixed point for $(\widetilde{f}_{t_i})^q-(p,r),$ and $(c,d)\neq (0,0)$ are certain integer vectors such that $W^u(\widetilde{P}_{\overline{t}})$ do not intersect $W^s(\widetilde{P}_{\overline{t}})+(c,d).$ And these tangencies become transverse as $t$ increases.;math.DS
1801.09825;On the global stability of departure time user equilibrium: A Lyapunov approach;In (Jin, 2018), a new day-to-day dynamical system was proposed for drivers' departure time choice at a single bottleneck. Based on three behavioral principles, the nonlocal departure and arrival times choice problems were converted to the local scheduling payoff choice problem, whose day-to-day dynamics are described by the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model on an imaginary road of increasing scheduling payoff. Thus the departure time user equilibrium (DTUE), the arrival time user equilibrium (ATUE), and the scheduling payoff user equilibrium (SPUE) are uniquely determined by the stationary state of the LWR model, which was shown to be locally, asymptotically stable with analysis of the discrete approximation of the LWR model and through a numerical example. In this study attempt to analytically prove the global stability of the SPUE, ATUE, and DTUE. We first generalize the conceptual models for arrival time and scheduling payoff choices developed in (Jin, 2018) for a single bottleneck with a generalized scheduling cost function, which includes the cost of the free-flow travel time. Then we present the LWR model for the day-to-day dynamics for the scheduling payoff choice as well as the SPUE. We further formulate a new optimization problem for the SPUE and demonstrate its equivalent to the optimization problem for the ATUE in (Iryo and Yoshii, 2007). Finally we show that the objective functions in the two optimization formulations are equal and can be used as the potential function for the LWR model and prove that the stationary state of the LWR model, and therefore, the SPUE, DTUE, and ATUE, are globally, asymptotically stable, by using Lyapunov's second method. Such a globally stable behavioral model can provide more efficient departure time and route choice guidance for human drivers and connected and autonomous vehicles in more complicated networks.;math.OC
1801.09826;Manhattan Curves for Hyperbolic Surfaces with Cusps;In this paper, we study an interesting curve, so-called the Manhattan curve, associated with a pair of boundary-preserving Fuchsian representations of a (non-compact) surface, especially representations corresponding to Riemann surfaces with cusps. Using Thermodynamic Formalism (for countable Markov shifts), we prove the analyticity of the Manhattan curve. Moreover, we derive several dynamical and geometric rigidity results, which generalize results of Marc Burger and Richard Sharp for convex-cocompact Fuchsian representations.;math.DS
1801.09828;Regularity and continuity of the multilinear strong maximal operators;Let $m\ge 1$, in this paper, our object of investigation is the regularity and and continuity properties of the following multilinear strong maximal operator $${\mathscr{M}}_{\mathcal{R}}(\vec{f})(x)=\sup_{\substack{R \ni x R\in\mathcal{R}}}\prod\limits_{i=1}^m\frac{1}{|R|}\int_{R}|f_i(y)|dy,$$ where $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\mathcal{R}$ denotes the family of all rectangles in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with sides parallel to the axes. When $m=1$, denote $\mathscr{M}_{\mathcal{R}}$ by $\mathcal {M}_{\mathcal{R}}$.Then, $\mathcal {M}_{\mathcal{R}}$ coincides with the classical strong maximal function initially studied by Jessen, Marcinkiewicz and Zygmund. We showed that ${\mathscr{M}}_{\mathcal{R}}$ is bounded and continuous from the Sobolev spaces $W^{1,p_1}(\mathbb{R}^d)\times \cdots\times W^{1,p_m}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ to $W^{1,p} (\mathbb{R}^d)$, from the Besov spaces $B_{s}^{p_1,q} (\mathbb{R}^d)\times\cdots\times B_s^{p_m,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ to $B_s^{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)$, from the Triebel-Lizorkin spaces $F_{s}^{p_1,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)\times\cdots\times F_s^{p_m,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ to $F_s^{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)$. As a consequence, we further showed that ${\mathscr{M}}_{\mathcal{R}}$ is bounded and continuous from the fractional Sobolev spaces $W^{s,p_1}(\mathbb{R}^d)\times \cdots\times W^{s,p_m}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ to $W^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for $0&lt,s\leq 1$ and $1&lt,p&lt,\infty$. As an application, we obtain a weak type inequality for the Sobolev capacity, which can be used to prove the $p$-quasicontinuity of $\mathscr{M}_{\mathcal{R}}$. The discrete type of the strong maximal operators has also been considered. We showed that this discrete type of the maximal operators enjoys somewhat unexpected regularity properties.;math.CA
1801.09832;Characterizations for inner functions in certain function spaces;For $\frac12&lt,p&lt,\infty$, $0&lt,q&lt,\infty$ and a certain two-sided doubling weight $\omega$, we characterize those inner functions $\Theta$ for which $$\|\Theta'\|_{A^{p,q}_\omega}^q=\int_0^1 \left(\int_0^{2\pi} |\Theta'(re^{i\theta})|^p d\theta\right)^{q/p} <br />\omega(r)\,dr&lt,\infty.$$ Then we show a modified version of this result for $p\ge q$. Moreover, two additional characterizations for inner functions whose derivative belongs to the Bergman space $A_\omega^{p,p}$ are given.;math.CV
1801.09836;On conormal and oblique derivative problem for elliptic equations with Dini mean oscillation coefficients;We show that weak solutions to conormal derivative problem for elliptic equations in divergence form are continuously differentiable up to the boundary provided that the mean oscillations of the leading coefficients satisfy the Dini condition, the lower order coefficients satisfy certain suitable conditions, and the boundary is locally represented by a $C^1$ function whose derivatives are Dini continuous. We also prove that strong solutions to oblique derivative problem for elliptic equations in nondivergence form are twice continuously differentiable up to the boundary if the mean oscillations of coefficients satisfy the Dini condition and the boundary is locally represented by a $C^1$ function whose derivatives are double Dini continuous. This in particular extends a result of M. V. Safonov (Comm. Partial Differential Equations 20:1349--1367, 1995);math.AP
1801.09837;Splitting Localization and Prediction Numbers;In this paper the work done by Newelski and Roslanowski is revisited to solve a question done by Blass about one of the possible evasion and prediction numbers. This led to define a variation of the $k$-localization property (the $(k+1)^{\omega}$-localization property) and the use of a forcing notion with accelerating trees.;math.LO
1801.09840;A time-optimal algorithm for solving (block-)tridiagonal linear systems of dimension N on a distributed computer of N nodes;We are concerned with the fastest possible direct numerical solution algorithm for a thin-banded or tridiagonal linear system of dimension $N$ on a distributed computing network of $N$ nodes that is connected in a binary communication tree. Our research is driven by the need for faster ways of numerically solving discretized systems of coupled one-dimensional black-box boundary-value problems. <br />Our paper presents two major results: First, we provide an algorithm that achieves the optimal parallel time complexity for solving a tridiagonal linear system and thin-banded linear systems. Second, we prove that it is impossible to improve the time complexity of this method by any polynomial degree. <br />To solve a system of dimension $m\cdot N$ and bandwidth $m \in \Omega(N^{1/6})$ on $2 \cdot N-1$ computing nodes, our method needs time complexity $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)^2 \cdot m^3)$.;math.NA
1801.09842;Fu-Yau Hessian Equations;We solve the Fu-Yau equation for arbitrary dimension and arbitrary slope $\alpha'$. Actually we obtain at the same time a solution of the open case $\alpha'&gt,0$, an improved solution of the known case $\alpha'&lt,0$, and solutions for a family of Hessian equations which includes the Fu-Yau equation as a special case. The method is based on the introduction of a more stringent ellipticity condition than the usual $\Gamma_k$ admissible cone condition, and which can be shown to be preserved by precise estimates with scale.;math.DG
1801.09843;Well-posedness of a non-local abstract Cauchy problem with a singular integral;A non-local abstract Cauchy problem with a singular integral is studied, which is a closed system of two evolution equations for a real-valued function and a function-valued function. By proposing an appropriate Banach space, the well-posedness of the evolution system is proved under some boundedness and smoothness conditions on the coefficient functions. Furthermore, an isomorphism is established to extend the result to a partial integro-differential equation with singular convolution kernel, which is a generalized form of the stationary Wigner equation. Our investigation considerably improves the understanding of the open problem concerning the well-posedness of the stationary Wigner equation with inflow boundary conditions.;math-ph
1801.09846;Antenna Selection for Large-Scale MIMO Systems with Low-Resolution ADCs;One way to reduce the power consumption in large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is to employ low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). In this paper, we investigate antenna selection for large-scale MIMO receivers with low-resolution ADCs, thereby providing more flexibility in resolution and number of ADCs. To incorporate quantization effects, we generalize an existing objective function for a greedy capacity-maximization antenna selection approach. The derived objective function offers an opportunity to select an antenna with the best tradeoff between the additional channel gain and increase in quantization error. Using the generalized objective function, we propose an antenna selection algorithm based on a conventional antenna selection algorithm without an increase in overall complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional algorithm in achievable capacity for the same number of antennas.;cs.IT
1801.09849;A characterization of nonnegativity relative to proper cones;Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix with real entries. Given two proper cones $K_1$ and $K_2$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{R}^m$, respectively, we say that $A$ is nonnegative if $A(K_1) \subseteq K_2$. $A$ is said to be semipositive if there exists a $x \in K_1^\circ$ such that $Ax \in K_2^\circ$. We prove that $A$ is nonnegative if and only if $A+B$ is semipositive for every semipositive matrix $B$. Applications of the above result are also brought out.;math.FA
1801.09850;Sparsity in Max-Plus Algebra and Systems;We study sparsity in the max-plus algebraic setting. We seek both exact and approximate solutions of the max-plus linear equation with minimum cardinality of support. In the former case, the sparsest solution problem is shown to be equivalent to the minimum set cover problem and, thus, NP-complete. In the latter one, the approximation is quantified by the $\ell_{1}$ residual error norm, which is shown to have supermodular properties under some convex constraints, called lateness constraints. Thus, greedy approximation algorithms of polynomial complexity can be employed for both problems with guaranteed bounds of approximation. We also study the sparse recovery problem and present conditions, under which, the sparsest exact solution solves it. Through multi-machine interactive processes, we describe how the present framework could be applied to two practical discrete event systems problems: resource optimization and structure-seeking system identification. We also show how sparsity is related to the pruning problem. Finally, we present a numerical example of the structure-seeking system identification problem and we study the performance of the greedy algorithm via simulations.;math.OC
1801.09852;Big polynomial rings and Stillman&#x27,s conjecture;The purpose of this paper is to prove that certain limits of polynomial rings are themselves polynomial rings, and show how this observation can be used to deduce some interesting results in commutative algebra. In particular, we give two new proofs of Stillman's conjecture. The first is similar to that of Ananyan-Hochster, though more streamlined, in particular, it establishes the existence of small subalgebras. The second proof is completely different, and relies on a recent noetherianity result of Draisma.;math.AC
1801.09863;Burnside groups and $n$-moves for links;Let $n$ be a positive integer. M. K. Dabkowski and J. H. Przytycki introduced the $n$th Burnside group of links which is preserved by $n$-moves, and proved that for any odd prime $p$ there exist links which are not equivalent to trivial links up to $p$-moves by using their $p$th Burnside groups. This gives counterexamples for the Montesinos-Nakanishi $3$-move conjecture. In general, it is hard to distinguish $p$th Burnside groups of a given link and a trivial link. We give a necessary condition for which $p$th Burnside groups are isomorphic to those of trivial links. The necessary condition gives us an efficient way to distinguish $p$th Burnside groups of a given link and a trivial link. As an application, we show that there exist links, each of which is not equivalent to a trivial link up to $p$-moves for any odd prime $p$.;math.GT
1801.09867;An iterative support shrinking algorithm for $\ell_{p}$-$\ell_{q}$ minimization;We present an iterative support shrinking algorithm for $\ell_{p}$-$\ell_{q}$ minimization~($0 &lt,p &lt, 1 \leq q &lt, \infty $). This algorithm guarantees the nonexpensiveness of the signal support set and can be easily implemented after being proximally linearized. The subproblem can be very efficiently solved due to its convexity and reducing size along iteration. We prove that the iterates of the algorithm globally converge to a stationary point of the $\ell_{p}$-$\ell_{q}$ objective function. In addition, we show a lower bound theory for the iteration sequence, which is more practical than the lower bound results for local minimizers in the literature.;math.NA

1801.09871;An infinite family of subcubic graphs with unbounded packing chromatic number;Recently, Balogh, Kostochka and Liu in [Packing chromatic number of cubic graphs, Discrete Math.~341 (2018) 474--483] answered in negative the question that was posed in several earlier papers whether the packing chromatic number is bounded in the class of graphs with maximum degree $3$. In this note, we present an explicit infinite family of subcubic graphs with unbounded packing chromatic number.;math.CO
1801.09875;Boundary effect in competition processes;This paper studies the long-term behaviour of a continuous time Markov chain formed by two non-negative integer valued components that evolve subject to a competitive interaction. In the absence of interaction the Markov chain is just a pair of independent linear birth processes with immigration. Interactions of interest include, as a special case, the famous Lotka-Volterra interaction. The Markov chain with another special case of interaction can be interpreted as an urn model with ball removals and is reminiscent, in a sense, of Friedman's urn model. We show that, with probability one, eventually one of the components of the process tends to infinity, while the other component oscillates between values $0$ and $1$ (between values $0$ and $2$ in a special case).;math.PR
1801.09880;An application of collapsing levels to the representation theory of affine vertex algebras;We discover a large class of simple affine vertex algebras $V_{k} (\mathfrak g)$, associated to basic Lie superalgebras $\mathfrak g$ at non-admissible collapsing levels $k$, having exactly one irreducible $\mathfrak g$-locally finite module in the category ${\mathcal O}$. In the case when $\mathfrak g$ is a Lie algebra, we prove a complete reducibility result for $V_k(\mathfrak g)$-modules at an arbitrary collapsing level. We also determine the generators of the maximal ideal in the universal affine vertex algebra $V^k (\mathfrak g)$ at certain negative integer levels. Considering some conformal embeddings in the simple affine vertex algebras $V_{-1/2} (C_n)$ and $V_{-4}(E_7)$, we surprisingly obtain the realization of non-simple affine vertex algebras of types $B$ and $D$ having exactly one non-trivial ideal.;math.RT
1801.09883;Comparison of robustness of statistical procedures for network structure analysis;Different network structures are compiared with respect to degree of robustnes of identification statistical procedures. It is shown that threshold (market) graph, cliques and independent sets in the threshold (market) graphs are preferable network structure from this point of view.;math.ST
1801.09884;Estimation of conditional extreme risk measures from heavy-tailed elliptical random vectors;In this work, we focus on some conditional extreme risk measures estimation for elliptical random vectors. In a previous paper, we proposed a methodology to approximate extreme quantiles, based on two extremal parameters. We thus propose some estimators for these parameters, and study their asymptotic properties in the case of heavy-tailed distributions. Thereafter, from these parameters, we construct extreme conditional quantiles estimators, and give their consistency properties. Using recent results on the asymptotic relationship between quantiles and other risk measures, we deduce estimators for extreme conditional Lp-quantiles and Haezendonck-Goovaerts risk measures. In order to test the efficiency of our estimators, we propose a simulation study. A financial data example is also proposed.;math.ST
1801.09886;Positivity preserving along a flow over projective bundle;In this paper, we introduce a flow over the projective bundle $p:P(E^*)\to M$, which is a natural generalization of both Hermitian-Yang-Mills flow and K\"ahler-Ricci flow. We prove that the semipositivity of curvature of the hyperplane line bundle $\mathcal{O}_{P(E^*)}(1)$ is preserved along this flow under the null eigenvector assumption. As applications, we prove that the semipositivity is preserved along the this flow if the base manifold $M$ is a curve, which implies that the Griffiths semipositivity is preserved along the Hermitian-Yang-Mills flow over a curve. And we also reprove that the nonnegativity of holomorphic bisectional curvature is preserved under K\"ahler-Ricci flow.;math.DG

1801.09888;SIR Coverage Analysis in Cellular Networks with Temporal Traffic: A Stochastic Geometry Approach;The bloom in mobile applications not just bring in enjoyment to daily life, but also imposes more complicated traffic situation on wireless network. A complete understanding of the impact from traffic profile is thus essential for network operators to respond adequately to the surge in data traffic. In this paper, based on stochastic geometry and queuing theory, we develop a mathematical framework that captures the interplay between the spatial location of base stations (BSs), which determines the magnitude of mutual interference, and their temporal traffic dy- namic. We derive a tractable expression for the SIR distribution, and verify its accuracy via simulations. Based on our analysis, we find that i) under the same configuration, when traffic condition changes from light to heavy, the corresponding SIR requirement can differ by more than 10 dB for the network to maintain coverage, ii) the SIR coverage probability varies largely with traffic fluctuation in the sub-medium load regime, whereas in scenario with very light traffic load, the SIR outage probability increases linearly with the packet arrival rate, iii) the mean delay, as well as coverage probability of cell edge user equipments (UEs) are vulnerable to the traffic fluctuation, thus confirms its appeal for traffic-aware communication technology.;cs.IT
1801.09889;Variational and viscosity operators for the evolutive Hamilton-Jacobi equation;We study the Cauchy problem for the first order evolutive Hamilton-Jacobi equation with a Lipschitz initial condition. The Hamiltonian is not necessarily convex in the momentum variable and not a priori compactly supported. We build and study an operator giving a variational solution of this problem, and get local Lipschitz estimates on this operator. Iterating this variational operator we obtain the viscosity operator and extend the estimates to the viscosity framework. We also check that the construction of the variational operator gives the Lax-Oleinik semigroup if the Hamiltonian is convex or concave in the momentum variable.;math.SG
1801.09890;Almost cosymplectic statistical manifolds;This paper is a study of almost contact statistical manifolds. Especially this study is focused on almost cosymplectic statistical manifolds. We obtained basic properties of such manifolds. It is proved a characterization theorem and a corollary for the almost cosymplectic statistical manifold with Kaehler leaves. We also study curvature properties of an almost cosymplectic statistical manifold. Moreover, examples are constructed.;math.DG
1801.09894;Bayesian inverse problems with unknown operators;We consider the Bayesian approach to linear inverse problems when the underlying operator depends on an unknown parameter. Allowing for finite dimensional as well as infinite dimensional parameters, the theory covers several models with different levels of uncertainty in the operator. Using product priors, we prove contraction rates for the posterior distribution which coincide with the optimal convergence rates up to logarithmic factors. In order to adapt to the unknown smoothness, an empirical Bayes procedure is constructed based on Lepski's method. The procedure is illustrated in numerical examples.;math.ST
1801.09895;One of the Odd Zeta Values from $&#x3b6,(5)$ to $&#x3b6,(25)$ Is Irrational. By Elementary Means;Available proofs of result of the type 'at least one of the odd zeta values $\zeta(5),\zeta(7),\dots,\zeta(s)$ is irrational' make use of the saddle-point method or of linear independence criteria, or both. These two remarkable techniques are however counted as highly non-elementary, therefore leaving the partial irrationality result inaccessible to general mathematics audience in all its glory. Here we modify the original construction of linear forms in odd zeta values to produce, for the first time, an elementary proof of such a result - a proof whose technical ingredients are limited to the prime number theorem and Stirling's approximation formula for the factorial.;math.NT
1801.09904;Taylor series for generalized Lambert W functions;The Lambert W function gives the solutions of a simple exponential polynomial. The generalized Lambert W function was defined by Mez\"{o} and Baricz, and has found applications in delay differential equations and physics. In this article we describe an even more general function, the inverse of a product of powers of linear functions and one exponential term. We show that the coefficients of the Taylor series for these functions can be described by multivariable hypergeometric functions of the parameters. We also present a surprising conjecture for the radius of convergence of the Taylor series, with a rough proof.;math.CA
1801.09906;Ito&#x27,s Formula for Gaussian Processes with Stochastic Discontinuities;We introduce a Skorokhod type integral and prove an Ito formula for a wide class of Gaussian processes which may exhibit stochastic discontinuities. Our Ito formula unifies and extends the classical one for general (i.e., possibly discontinuous) Gaussian martingales in the sense of Ito integration and the one for stochastically continuous Gaussian non-martingales in the Skorokhod sense, which was first derived in Alos et al. (Ann. Probab. 29, 2001). A main observation is that the jump terms, which appear in the general Gaussian Ito formula, only depend on the deterministic times of stochastic discontinuities and not on the random pathwise jump times of the process.;math.PR
1801.09909;Properties of additive functionals of Brownian motion with resetting;We study the distribution of additive functionals of reset Brownian motion, a variation of normal Brownian motion in which the path is interrupted at a given rate and placed back to a given reset position. Our goal is two-fold: (1) For general functionals, we derive a large deviation principle in the presence of resetting and identify the large deviation rate function in terms of a variational formula involving large deviation rate functions without resetting. (2) For three examples of functionals (positive occupation time, area and absolute area), we investigate the effect of resetting by computing distributions and moments, using a formula that links the generating function with resetting to the generating function without resetting.;math.PR
1801.09911;A Dynamic Process Interpretation of the Sparse ERGM Reference Model;Exponential family random graph models (ERGMs) can be understood in terms of a set of structural biases that act on an underlying reference distribution. This distribution determines many aspects of the behavior and interpretation of the ERGM families incorporating it. One important innovation in this area has been the development of an ERGM reference model that produces realistic behavior when generalized to sparse networks of varying size. Here, we show that this model can be derived from a latent dynamic process in which tie formation takes place within small local settings between which individuals move. This derivation provides one possible micro-process interpretation of the sparse ERGM reference model, and sheds light on the conditions under which constant mean degree scaling can emerge.;math.ST
1801.09916;Input / Output Stability of a Damped String Equation coupled with Ordinary Differential System;The input/output stability of an interconnected system composed of an ordinary differential equation and a damped string equation is studied. Issued from the literature on time-delay systems, an exact stability result is firstly derived using pole locations. Then, based on the Small-Gain theorem and on the Quadratic Separation framework, some robust stability criteria are provided. The latter follows from a projection of the infinite dimensional state on an orthogonal basis of Legendre polynomials. Numerical examples comparing these results with the ones in the literature are proposed and a comparison of its efficiency is made.;math.OC
1801.09921;On the properties of the $(p,&#x3bd,)$-extension of the Whittaker function $M_{&#x3ba,,&#x3bc,}(z)$;In this paper, we obtain a $(p,\nu)$-extension of the Whittaker function $M_{\kappa,\mu}(z)$ by using the extended confluent hypergeometric function of the first kind $\Phi_{p,\nu}(b,c,z)$ introduced in Parmar et al. [J. Classical Anal. 11 (2017) 81--106]. Also, we derive some of the main properties of this function, namely several integral representations, a summation formula, the analogue of Kummer's transformation formula, an asymptotic representation, the Mellin transform, a differential formula and some inequalities.;math.CA
1801.09922;Modern Regularization Methods for Inverse Problems;Regularization methods are a key tool in the solution of inverse problems. They are used to introduce prior knowledge and make the approximation of ill-posed (pseudo-)inverses feasible. In the last two decades interest has shifted from linear towards nonlinear regularization methods even for linear inverse problems. The aim of this paper is to provide a reasonably comprehensive overview of this development towards modern nonlinear regularization methods, including their analysis, applications, and issues for future research. <br />In particular we will discuss variational methods and techniques derived from those, since they have attracted particular interest in the last years and link to other fields like image processing and compressed sensing. We further point to developments related to statistical inverse problems, multiscale decompositions, and learning theory.;math.NA
1801.09923;Analytical modeling and analysis of interleaving on correlated wireless channels;Interleaving is a mechanism universally used in wireless access technologies to alleviate the effect of channel correlation. In spite of its wide adoption, to the best of our knowledge, there are no analytical models proposed so far. In this paper we fill this void proposing three different models of interleaving. Two of these models are based on numerical algorithms while one of them allows for closed-form expression for packet error probability. Although we use block codes with hard decoding to specify the models our modeling principles are applicable to all forward error correction codes as long as there exists a functional relationship (possibly, probabilistic) between the number of incorrectly received bits in a codeword and the codeword error probability. We evaluate accuracy of our models showing that the worst case prediction is limited by 50\% across a wide range of input parameters. Finally, we study the effect of interleaving in detail demonstrating how it varies with channel correlation, bit error rate and error correction capability. Numerical results reported in this paper allows to identify the optimal value of the interleaving depth that need to be used for a channel with a given degree of correlation. The reference implementations of the models are available [1].;cs.IT
1801.09924;Toda hierarchies and their applications;The 2D Toda hierarchy occupies a central position in the family of integrable hierarchies of the Toda type. The 1D Toda hierarchy and the Ablowitz-Ladik (aka relativistic Toda) hierarchy can be derived from the 2D Toda hierarchy as reductions. These integrable hierarchies have been applied to various problems of mathematics and mathematical physics since 1990s. A recent example is a series of studies on models of statistical mechanics called the melting crystal model. This research has revealed that the aforementioned two reductions of the 2D Toda hierarchy underlie two different melting crystal models. Technical clues are a fermionic realization of the quantum torus algebra, special algebraic relations therein called shift symmetries, and a matrix factorization problem. The two melting crystal models thus exhibit remarkable similarity with the Hermitian and unitary matrix models for which the two reductions of the 2D Toda hierarchy play the role of fundamental integrable structures.;math-ph
1801.09925;Multiplicity results for $(p,\, q)$ fractional elliptic equations involving critical nonlinearities;In this paper we prove the existence of infinitely many nontrivial solutions for the class of $(p,\, q)$ fractional elliptic equations involving concave-critical nonlinearities in bounded domains in $\mathbb{R}^N$. Further, when the nonlinearity is of convex-critical type, we establish the multiplicity of nonnegative solutions using variational methods. In particular, we show the existence of at least $cat_{\Omega}(\Omega)$ nonnegative solutions.;math.AP
1801.09928;Invariable generation of permutation and linear groups;A subset $\left\{x_{1},x_{2},\hdots,x_{d}\right\}$ of a group $G$ \emph{invariably generates} $G$ if $\left\{x_{1}^{g_{1}},x_{2}^{g_{2}},\hdots,x_{d}^{g_{d}}\right\}$ generates $G$ for every $d$-tuple $(g_{1},g_{2}\hdots,g_{d})\in G^{d}$. We prove that a finite completely reducible linear group of dimension $n$ can be invariably generated by $\left\lfloor \frac{3n}{2}\right\rfloor$ elements. We also prove tighter bounds when the field in question has order $2$ or $3$. Finally, we prove that a transitive [respectively primitive] permutation group of degree $n\geq 2$ [resp. $n\geq 3$] can be invariably generated by $O\left(\frac{n}{\sqrt{\log{n}}}\right)$ [resp. $O\left(\frac{\log{n}}{\sqrt{\log{\log{n}}}}\right)$] elements.;math.GR
1801.09930;Trace class groups: the case of semi-direct products;In this paper we continue the study of groups of trace class and consider in particular the case of semi-direct products. One of the highlights is the theorem saying that the semi-direct product of a semisimple Lie group G and its Lie algebra is a trace class group if and only if G is compact.;math.RT
1801.09933;Nonlinear stability of 2-solitons of the Sine-Gordon equation in the energy space;In this article we prove that 2-soliton solutions of the sine-Gordon equation (SG) are orbitally stable in the natural energy space of the problem. The solutions that we study are the {\it 2-kink, kink-antikink and breather} of SG. In order to prove this result, we will use B\"acklund transformations implemented by the Implicit Function Theorem. These transformations will allow us to reduce the stability of the three solutions to the case of the vacuum solution, in the spirit of previous results by Alejo and the first author, which was done for the case of the scalar modified Korteweg-de Vries equation. However, we will see that SG presents several difficulties because of its vector valued character. Our results improve those in Alejo et al., and give a first rigorous proof of the stability in the energy space of SG 2-solitons.;math.AP
1801.09934;The Necklace Process: A Generating Function Approach;The "necklace process", a procedure constructing necklaces of black and white beads by randomly choosing positions to insert new beads (whose color is uniquely determined based on the chosen location), is revisited. This article illustrates how, after deriving the corresponding bivariate probability generating function, the characterization of the asymptotic limiting distribution of the number of beads of a given color follows as a straightforward consequence within the analytic combinatorics framework.;math.PR
1801.09935;On series of translates of positive functions III;Suppose $\Lambda$ is a discrete infinite set of nonnegative real numbers. We say that $ {\Lambda}$ is of type 1 if the series $s(x)=\sum_{\lambda\in\Lambda}f(x+\lambda)$ satisfies a zero-one law. This means that for any non-negative measurable $f: { {\mathbb R}}\to [0,+ {\infty})$ either the convergence set $C(f, {\Lambda})=\{x: s(x)&lt,+ {\infty} \}= { {\mathbb R}}$ modulo sets of Lebesgue zero, or its complement the divergence set $D(f, {\Lambda})=\{x: s(x)=+ {\infty} \}= { {\mathbb R}}$ modulo sets of measure zero. If $ {\Lambda}$ is not of type 1 we say that $ {\Lambda}$ is of type 2. In this paper we show that there is a universal $ {\Lambda}$ with gaps monotone decreasingly converging to zero such that for any open subset $G \subset { {\mathbb R}}$ one can find a characteristic function $f_{G}$ such that $G \subset D(f_G, {\Lambda})$ and $C(f_G, {\Lambda})= { {\mathbb R}} {\setminus} G$ modulo sets of measure zero. We also consider the question whether $C(f, {\Lambda})$ can contain non-degenerate intervals for continuous functions when $D(f, {\Lambda})$ is of positive measure. The above results answer some questions raised in a paper of Z. Buczolich, J-P. Kahane, and D. Mauldin.;math.CA
1801.09939;Macdonald Polynomials of Type $C_n$ with One-Column Diagrams and Deformed Catalan Numbers;We present an explicit formula for the transition matrix $\mathcal{C}$ from the type $C_n$ degeneration of the Koornwinder polynomials $P_{(1^r)}(x\,|\,a,-a,c,-c\,|\,q,t)$ with one column diagrams, to the type $C_n$ monomial symmetric polynomials $m_{(1^{r})}(x)$. The entries of the matrix $\mathcal{C}$ enjoy a set of three term recursion relations, which can be regarded as a $(a,c,t)$-deformation of the one for the Catalan triangle or ballot numbers. Some transition matrices are studied associated with the type $(C_n,C_n)$ Macdonald polynomials $P^{(C_n,C_n)}_{(1^r)}(x\,|\,b,q,t)= P_{(1^r)}\big(x\,|\,b^{1/2},-b^{1/2},q^{1/2}b^{1/2},-q^{1/2}b^{1/2}\,|\,q,t\big)$. It is also shown that the $q$-ballot numbers appear as the Kostka polynomials, namely in the transition matrix from the Schur polynomials $P^{(C_n,C_n)}_{(1^r)}(x\,|\,q,q,q)$ to the Hall-Littlewood polynomials $P^{(C_n,C_n)}_{(1^r)}(x\,|\,t,0,t)$.;math.QA
