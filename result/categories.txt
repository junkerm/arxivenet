1801.00020;K-theory and actions on Euclidean retracts;This note surveys axiomatic results for the Farrell-Jones Conjecture in terms of actions on Euclidean retracts and applications of these to GL_n(Z), relative hyperbolic groups and mapping class groups.;math.KT
1801.00023;Exceptional sets for nonuniformly hyperbolic diffeomorphisms;For a surface diffeomorphism, a compact invariant locally maximal set $W$ and some subset $A\subset W$ we study the $A$-exceptional set, that is, the set of points whose orbits do not accumulate at $A$. We show that if the Hausdorff dimension of $A$ is smaller than the Hausdorff dimension $d$ of some ergodic hyperbolic measure, then the topological entropy of the exceptional set is at least the entropy of this measure and its Hausdorff dimension is at least $d$. Particular consequences occur when there is some a priori defined hyperbolic structure on $W$ and, for example, if there exists an SRB measure.;math.DS
1801.00024;On the topological equivalence of S-metric and cone S-metric spaces;The aim of this paper is to establish the equivalence between the concepts of an $S$-metric space and a cone $S$-metric space using\ some topological approaches. We introduce a new notion of $TVS$-cone $S$-metric space using some facts about topological vector spaces. We see that the known results on cone $S$-metric spaces (or $N$-cone metric spaces) can be directly obtained from the studies on $S$-metric spaces.;math.GN
1801.00028;Smooth quotients of abelian varieties by finite groups;We give a complete classification of smooth quotients of abelian varieties by finite groups that fix the origin. In the particular case where the action of the group $G$ on the tangent space at the origin of the abelian variety $A$ is irreducible, we prove that $A$ is isomorphic to the self-product of an elliptic curve and $A/G\simeq \mathbb P^n$. In the general case, assuming $\dim(A^G)=0$, we prove that $A/G$ is isomorphic to a direct product of projective spaces.;math.AG
1801.00029;Graded Expectations: Betti numbers and anti-lecture hall compositions of random threshold graphs;This paper examines the one-to-one-to-one correspondence between threshold graphs, Betti numbers of quotients of polynomial rings by 2-linear ideals, and anti-lecture hall compositions. In particular, we establish new explicit combinatorial mappings between each of these classes of objects and calculate the expected values of the Betti numbers and anti-lecture hall composition corresponding to a random threshold graph.;math.CO
1801.00032;On uniqueness of end sums and 1-handles at infinity;For oriented manifolds of dimension at least 4 that are simply connected at infinity, it is known that end summing is a uniquely defined operation. Calcut and Haggerty showed that more complicated fundamental group behavior at infinity can lead to nonuniqueness. The present paper examines how and when uniqueness fails. Examples are given, in the categories TOP, PL and DIFF, of nonuniqueness that cannot be detected in a weaker category (including the homotopy category). In contrast, uniqueness is proved for Mittag-Leffler ends, and generalized to allow slides and cancellation of (possibly infinite) collections of 0- and 1-handles at infinity. Various applications are presented, including an analysis of how the monoid of smooth manifolds homeomorphic to R^4 acts on the smoothings of any noncompact 4-manifold.;math.GT
1801.00033;Concerning $q$-summable Szlenk index;For each ordinal $\xi$ and each $1\leqslant q&lt,\infty$, we define the notion of $\xi$-$q$-summable Szlenk index. When $\xi=0$ and $q=1$, this recovers the usual notion of summable Szlenk index. We define for an arbitrary weak$^*$-compact set a transfinite, asymptotic analogue $\alpha_{\xi,p}$ of the martingale type norm of an operator. We prove that this quantity is determined by norming sets and determines $\xi$-Szlenk power type and $\xi$-$q$-summability of Szlenk index. This fact allows us to prove that the behavior of operators under the $\alpha_{\xi,p}$ seminorms passes in the strongest way to injective tensor products of Banach spaces. Furthermore, we combine this fact with a result of Schlumprecht to prove that a separable Banach space with good behavior with respect to the $\alpha_{\xi,p}$ seminorm can be embedded into a Banach space with a shrinking basis and the same behavior under $\alpha_{\xi,p}$, and in particular it can be embedded into a Banach space with a shrinking basis and the same $\xi$-Szlenk power type. Finally, we completely elucidate the behavior of the $\alpha_{\xi,p}$ seminorms under $\ell_r$ direct sums. This allows us to give an alternative proof of a result of Brooker regarding Szlenk indices of $\ell_p$ and $c_0$ direct sums of operators.;math.FA
1801.00034;Mean field matching and TSP in pseudo-dimension 1;Recent work on optimization problems in random link models has verified several conjectures originating in statistical physics and the replica and cavity methods. In particular the numerical value 2.0415 for the limit length of a traveling salesman tour in a complete graph with uniform $[0,1]$ edge lengths has been established. <br />In this paper we show that the crucial integral equation obtained with the cavity method has a unique solution, and that the limit ground state energy obtained from this solution agrees with the rigorously derived value. Moreover, the method by which we establish uniqueness of the solution turns out to yield a new completely rigorous derivation of the limit.;math.PR
1801.00037;On linear sections of the spinor tenfold, I;We discuss the geometry of transverse linear sections of the spinor tenfold $X$, the connected component of the orthogonal Grassmannian of 5-dimensional isotropic subspaces in a 10-dimensional vector space equipped with a non-degenerate quadratic form. In particular, we show that as soon as the dimension of a linear section of $X$ is at least 5, its integral Chow motive is of Lefschetz type. We discuss classification of smooth linear sections of $X$ of small codimension, in particular we check that there is a unique isomorphism class of smooth hyperplane sections and exactly two isomorphism classes of smooth linear sections of codimension 2. Using this, we define a natural quadratic line complex associated with a linear section of $X$. We also discuss the Hilbert schemes of linear spaces and quadrics on $X$ and its linear sections.;math.AG
1801.00038;Identifiability of two-component skew normal mixtures with one known component;We give sufficient identifiability conditions for estimating mixing proportions in two-component mixtures of skew normal distributions with one known component. We consider the univariate case as well as two multivariate extensions: a multivariate skew normal distribution (MSN) by Azzalini and Dalla Valle (1996) and the canonical fundamental skew normal distribution (CFUSN) by Arellano-Valle and Genton (2005). The characteristic function of the CFUSN distribution is additionally derived.;math.ST
1801.00039;Inverse scattering for the massive Thirring model;We consider the massive Thirring model in the laboratory coordinates and explain how the inverse scattering transform can be developed with the Riemann-Hilbert approach. The key ingredient of our method is to transform the corresponding spectral problem to the equivalent forms: one is suitable for the spectral parameter at the origin and the other one is suitable for the spectral parameter at infinity. Global solutions to the massive Thirring model are recovered from the reconstruction formulae at the origin and at infinity.;math.AP
1801.00043;Network Deployment for Maximal Energy Efficiency in Uplink with Multislope Path Loss;This work aims to design the uplink (UL) of a cellular network for maximal energy efficiency (EE). Each base station (BS) is randomly deployed within a given area and is equipped with $M$ antennas to serve $K$ user equipments (UEs). A multislope (distance-dependent) path loss model is considered and linear processing is used, under the assumption that channel state information is acquired by using pilot sequences (reused across the network). Within this setting, a lower bound on the UL spectral efficiency and a realistic circuit power consumption model are used to evaluate the network EE. Numerical results are first used to compute the optimal BS density and pilot reuse factor for a Massive MIMO network with three different detection schemes, namely, maximum ratio combining, zero-forcing (ZF) and multicell minimum mean-squared error. The numerical analysis shows that the EE is a unimodal function of BS density and achieves its maximum for a relatively small density of BS, irrespective of the employed detection scheme. This is in contrast to the single-slope (distance-independent) path loss model, for which the EE is a monotonic non-decreasing function of BS density. Then, we concentrate on ZF and use stochastic geometry to compute a new lower bound on the spectral efficiency, which is then used to optimize, for a given BS density, the pilot reuse factor, number of BS antennas and UEs. Closed- form expressions are computed from which valuable insights into the interplay between optimization variables, hardware characteristics, and propagation environment are obtained.;cs.IT
1801.00044;Cyclic descents for near-hook and two-row shapes;A notion of cyclic descents on standard Young tableaux (SYT) of rectangular shape was introduced by Rhoades, and extended to certain skew shapes by the last two authors. The cyclic descent set restricts to the usual descent set when the largest value is ignored, and has the property that the number of SYT of a given shape with a given cyclic descent set $D$ is invariant under cyclic shifts of the entries of $D$. Following these results, the existence of cyclic descent sets for standard Young tableaux of any skew shape other than a ribbon was conjectured by the authors, and recently proved by Adin, Reiner and Roichman. Unfortunately, the proof does not provide a natural definition of the cyclic descent set for a specific tableau. <br />In this paper we explicitly describe cyclic descent sets and resulting generating functions for SYT of (possibly skew) shapes which either have exactly two rows or are near-hooks, i.e., are one cell away from a hook. Our definition provides a constructive combinatorial proof of the existence of cyclic descent sets for these shapes, and coincides with that of Rhoades for two-row rectangular shapes. We also show that cyclic descent sets for near-hook shaped tableaux are unique.;math.CO
1801.00045;Webs of type Q;We introduce web supercategories of type Q. We describe the structure of these categories and show they have a symmetric braiding. The main result of the paper shows these diagrammatically defined monoidal supercategories provide combinatorial models for the monoidal supercategories generated by the supersymmetric tensor powers of the natural supermodule for the Lie superalgebra of type Q.;math.RT
1801.00051;Stability Analysis of Coupled Structural Acoustics PDE Models under Thermal Effects and with no Additional Dissipation;In this study we consider a coupled system of partial differential equations (PDE's) which describes a certain structural acoustics interaction. One component of this PDE system is a wave equation, which serves to model the interior acoustic wave medium within a given three dimensional chamber $% \Omega $. This acoustic wave equation is coupled on a boundary interface ($% \Gamma _{0}$) to a two dimensional system of thermoelasticity: this thermoelastic PDE comprises a structural beam or plate equation, which governs the vibrations of flexible wall portion $\Gamma _{0}$ of the chamber $\Omega $, the elastic dynamics is coupled to a heat equation which also evolves on $\Gamma _{0}$, and which imparts a thermal damping onto the entire structural acoustic system. As we said, the interaction between the wave and thermoelastic PDE components takes place on the boundary interface $% \Gamma _{0}$, and involves coupling boundary terms which are above the level of finite energy. We analyze the stability properties of this coupled structural acoustics PDE model, in the absence of \ any additive feedback dissipation on the hard walls $\Gamma _{1}$ of the boundary $\partial \Omega $. Under a certain geometric assumption on $\Gamma _{1}$, an assumption which has appeared in the literature in conection with structural acoustic flow, and which allows for the invocation of a recently derived microlocal boundary trace estimate, we show that classical solutions of this thermally damped structural acoustics PDE decay uniformly to zero, with a rational rate of decay.;math.AP
1801.00053;From analytical mechanical problems to rewriting theory through M. Janet;This note surveys the historical background of the Gr\"obner basis theory for D-modules and linear rewriting theory. The objective is to present a deep interaction of these two fields largely developed in algebra throughout the twentieth century. We recall the work of M. Janet on the algebraic analysis on linear partial differential systems that leads to the notion of involutive division. We present some generalizations of the division introduced by M. Janet and their relations with Gr\"obner basis theory.;math.HO
1801.00057;Preservation of Trees by semidirect Products;We show that the semidirect product of a group $C$ by $A*_D B$ is isomorphic to the free product of $A\rtimes C$ and $B\rtimes C$ amalgamated at $D\rtimes C$, where $A$, $B$ and $C$ are arbitrary groups. Moreover, we apply this theorem to prove that any group $G$ that acts without inversion on a tree $T$ that possesses a segment $\Gamma$ for its quotient graph, such that, if the stabilizers of the vertex set $\{\,P,Q\,\}$ and edge $y$ of a lift of $\, \Gamma$ in $T$ are of the form $G_{P}\!\rtimes H$, $G_{Q}\!\rtimes H$ and $G_{y}\! \rtimes H$, then $G$ is isomorphic to the semidirect product of $H$ by $(\,G_P \,*_{G_y} \,G_Q \,)$. <br />Using our results we conclude with a non-standard verification of the isomorphism between $GL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ and the free product of the dihedral groups $D_4$ and $D_6$ amalgamated at their Klein-four group.;math.GR
1801.00058;A simple mathematical model for unemployment: a case study in Portugal with optimal control;We propose a simple mathematical model for unemployment. Despite its simpleness, we claim that the model is more realistic and useful than recent models available in the literature. A case study with real data from Portugal supports our claim. An optimal control problem is formulated and solved, which provides some non-trivial and interesting conclusions.;math.OC
1801.00066;Normally hyperbolic surfaces based finite-time transient stability monitoring of power system dynamics;In this paper, we develop a methodology for finite time rotor angle stability analysis using the theory of normal hyperbolic surfaces. The proposed method would bring new insights to the existing techniques, which are based on asymptotic analysis. For the finite time analysis we have adopted the Theory of normally hyperbolic surfaces. We have connected the repulsion rates of the normally hyperbolic surfaces, to the finite time stability. Also, we have characterized the region of stability over finite time window. The parallels have been drawn with the existing tools for asymptotic analysis. Also, we have proposed a model free method for online stability monitoring.;math.OC
1801.00068;Contingency Analysis of Power Networks : A System Theoretic Approach;In this work, we have proposed a system theoretic method to compute sensitivities of different lines for $N-k$ contingency analysis in power network. We have formulated the $N-k$ contingency analysis as the stability problem of power network with uncertain links. We have derived a necessary condition for stochastic stability of the power network with the link uncertainty. The necessary condition is then used to rank order the contingencies. We have shown due to interaction between different uncertainties the ranking can substantially change. The state of the art $N-k$ contingency analysis does not consider the possibility of interference between link uncertainties and rank the links according to the severity of $N-1$ contingencies. We have presented simulation results for New England $39$ bus system as a support of our claim.;math.OC
1801.00070;Sum of squares certificates for stability of planar, homogeneous, and switched systems;We show that existence of a global polynomial Lyapunov function for a homogeneous polynomial vector field or a planar polynomial vector field (under a mild condition) implies existence of a polynomial Lyapunov function that is a sum of squares (sos) and that the negative of its derivative is also a sum of squares. This result is extended to show that such sos-based certificates of stability are guaranteed to exist for all stable switched linear systems. For this class of systems, we further show that if the derivative inequality of the Lyapunov function has an sos certificate, then the Lyapunov function itself is automatically a sum of squares. These converse results establish cases where semidefinite programming is guaranteed to succeed in finding proofs of Lyapunov inequalities. Finally, we demonstrate some merits of replacing the sos requirement on a polynomial Lyapunov function with an sos requirement on its top homogeneous component. In particular, we show that this is a weaker algebraic requirement in addition to being cheaper to impose computationally.;math.OC
1801.00072;Invariant submanifolds for affine control systems;Given an affine control system $\dot{\mathbf x} = f({\mathbf x}) + \sum_{j=1}^m g_j({\mathbf x}) u_j$ we present an algorithmic process of construction of submanifolds that are invariant under controls assuming that the linear span of $f, g_1, \ldots, g_m$ has constant rank. We use the method of reduction of Pfaffian systems to a largest integrable subsystem and finding the first integrals and the generalized first integrals for the vector fields.;math.DS
1801.00079;HDG-POD Reduced Order Model of the Heat Equation;We propose a new hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) model order reduction technique based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). We consider the heat equation as a test problem and prove error bounds that converge to zero as the number of POD modes increases. We present 2D and 3D numerical results to illustrate the convergence analysis.;math.NA
1801.00081;Validity of formal expansions for singularly perturbed competition-diffusion systems;We consider a two-species competition-diffusion system involving a small parameter $\varepsilon&gt,0$ and discuss the validity of formal asymptotic expansions of solutions near the sharp interface limit $\varepsilon\approx0$. We assume that the corresponding ODE system has two stable equilibria. As in the scalar Allen--Cahn equation, it is known that the motion of the sharp interfaces of such systems is governed by the mean curvature flow with a driving force. The formal expansion also suggests that the profile of the transition layers converges to that of a traveling wave solution as $\varepsilon\rightarrow0$. In this paper, we rigorously verify this latter ansatz for a large class of initial data. <br />The proof relies on a rescaling argument, the super--subsolution method and a Liouville type theorem for eternal solutions of parabolic systems. Roughly speaking, the Liouville type theorem states that any eternal solution that lies between two traveling waves is itself a traveling wave. The same Liouville type theorem was established for the scalar Allen--Cahn equation by Berestycki and Hamel. In view of their importance, we prove the Liouville type theorems in a rather general framework, not only for two-species competition-diffusion systems but also for $m$-species cooperation-diffusion systems possibly with time periodic or spatially periodic coefficients.;math.AP
1801.00082;An HDG Method for Distributed Control of Convection Diffusion PDEs;We propose a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method to approximate the solution of a distributed optimal control problem governed by an elliptic convection diffusion PDE. We derive optimal a priori error estimates for the state, adjoint state, their fluxes, and the optimal control. We present 2D and 3D numerical experiments to illustrate our theoretical results.;math.NA
1801.00088;On optimal periodic dividend and capital injection strategies for spectrally negative L&#xe9,vy models;De Finetti's optimal dividend problem has recently been extended to the case dividend payments can only be made at Poisson arrival times. This paper considers the version with bail-outs where the surplus must be nonnegative uniformly in time. For a general spectrally negative L\'evy model, we show the optimality of a Parisian-classical reflection strategy that pays the excess above a given barrier at each Poisson arrival times and also reflects from below at zero in the classical sense.;math.PR
1801.00089;Essential dimension of finite groups in prime characteristic;Given a finite smooth group scheme $G$ over a field of characteristic $p &gt, 0$, we show that the essential dimension of $G$ at $p$ is $0$ when $p$ does not divide the order of $G$, and $1$ when it does.;math.GR
1801.00097;Hidden constructions in abstract algebra. Krull Dimension of distributive lattices and commutative rings;We present constructive versions of Krull's dimension theory for commutative rings and distributive lattices. The foundations of these constructive versions are due to Joyal, Espa\~nol and the authors. We show that the notion of Krull dimension has an explicit computational content in the form of existence (or lack of existence) of some algebraic identities. We can then get an explicit computational content where abstract results about dimensions are used to show the existence of concrete elements. This can be seen as a partial realisation of Hilbert's program for classical abstract commutative algebra.;math.AC
1801.00099;Null structures and degenerate dispersion relations in two space dimensions;Motivated by water-wave problems, in this paper we consider a class of nonlinear dispersive PDEs in 2D with cubic nonlinearities, whose dispersion relations are radial and have vanishing Guassian curvature on a circle. For such a model we identify certain null structures for the cubic nonlinearity, which suffice in order to guarantee global scattering solutions for the small data problem. Our null structures in the power-type nonlinearity are weak, and only eliminate the worst nonlinear interaction. Such null structures arise naturally in some water-wave problems.;math.AP
1801.00104;Global attractors for the damped nonlinear wave equation in unbounded domains;The existence of a global attractor for wave equations in unbounded domains is a challenging problem due to the non-compactness of the Sobolev embeddings. To overcome this difficulty, some authors have worked with weighted Sobolev spaces which restrict the choice of the initial data. Using the "tail estimation method" introduced by B. Wang for reaction diffusion equations, we establish in this paper the existence of a global attractor for two wave equations in the traditional Hilbert spaces $\displaystyle H^1(\Omega)\times L^2(\Omega)$ where $\Omega$ is an unbounded domain of $\R^N$. The first equation, with a mass term is studied in the whole space $\R^N$ and the second one without mass term is considered in a domain bounded in only one direction so that Poincar\'e inequality will hold.;math.AP
1801.00106;Content Placement in Cache Networks Using Graph-Coloring;Small cell densification is one of the effective ideas addressing the demand for higher capacity in cellular networks. The major problem faced in such networks is the wireless backhaul link and its limited capacity. Caching most popular files in the memories of small cells base station (SBSs) is an effective solution to this problem. One of the main challenges in caching is choosing the files that are going to be stored in the memory of SBS. In this paper, we model the described caching problem as a graph. This graph is divided into four sub-graphs including placement, access, SBSs and delivery graphs. By making some modifications to the SBS graph, we convert it to a graph that can be colored. Coloring of the generated graph is NP-hard and we use an algorithm proposed in graph-coloring area to color it. To overcome the complexity of above coloring technique, we then propose a simple graph-coloring method based on two point processes, Matern Core-type I and II. We model our network with a new weighted graph which simply can be colored and after that the files are cached accordingly. We evaluate the performance of our proposed methods through simulations. Our results show that by employing out proposed method in a typical considered SBSs network, the load on the macro base station can be reduced by around $25 \%$, at the distribution parameter of popularity of files equals to $0.6$, compared to conventional policy which caches the most popular content every where.;cs.IT
1801.00107;Quasi-units as orthogonal projections;The notion of quasi-unit has been introduced by Yosida in unital Riesz spaces. Later on, a fruitful potential theoretic generalization was obtained by Arsove and Leutwiler. Due to the work of Eriksson and Leutwiler, this notion also turned out to be an effective tool by investigating the extreme structure of operator segments. This paper has multiple purposes which are interwoven, and are intended to be equally important. On the one hand, we identify quasi-units as orthogonal projections acting on an appropriate auxiliary Hilbert space. As projections form a lattice and are extremal points of the effect algebra, we conclude the same properties for quasi-units. Our second aim is to apply these results for nonnegative sesquilinear forms. Constructing an order preserving bijection between operator- and form segments, we provide a characterization of being extremal in the convexity sense, and we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the greatest lower bound of two forms. Closing the paper we revisit some statements by using the machinery developed by Hassi, Sebesty\'en, and de Snoo. It will turn out that quasi-units are exactly the closed elements with respect to the antitone Galois connection induced by parallel addition and subtraction.;math.FA
1801.00109;Finite field analogue of restriction theorem for general measures;We study restriction problem in vector spaces over finite fields. We obtain finite field analogue of Mockenhaupt-Mitsis-Bak-Seenger restriction theorem, and we show that the range of the exponentials is sharp.;math.CA
1801.00111;Inverting non-invertible trees;If a graph has a non-singular adjacency matrix, then one may use the inverse matrix to define a (labeled) graph that may be considered to be the inverse graph to the original one. It has been known that an adjacency matrix of a tree is non-singular if and only if the tree has a unique perfect matching, in this case the determinant of the matrix turns out to be $\pm 1$ and the inverse of the tree was shown to be `switching-equivalent' to a simple graph [C. Godsil, Inverses of Trees, Combinatorica 5 (1985), 33--39]. Using generalized inverses of symmetric matrices (that coincide with Moore-Penrose, Drazin, and group inverses in the symmetric case) we prove a formula for determining a `generalized inverse' of a tree.;math.CO
1801.00113;A generalization of Neumann&#x27,s Question;Let $G$ be a group, $m\geq2$ and $n\geq1$. We say that $G$ is an $\mathcal{T}(m,n)$-group if for every $m$ subsets $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_m$ of $G$ of cardinality $n$, there exists $i\neq j$ and $x_i \in X_i, x_j \in X_j$ such that $x_ix_j=x_jx_i$. In this paper, we give some examples of finite and infinite non-abelian $\mathcal{T}(m,n)$-groups and we discuss finiteness and commutativity of such groups. We also show solvability length of a solvable $\mathcal{T}(m,n)$-group is bounded in terms of $m$ and $n$.;math.GR
1801.00117;A New Sparsification and Reconstruction Strategy for Compressed Sensing Photoacoustic Tomography;Compressed sensing (CS) is a promising approach to reduce the number of measurements in photoacoustic tomography (PAT) while preserving high spatial resolution. This allows to increase the measurement speed and to reduce system costs. Instead of collecting point-wise measurements, in CS one uses various combinations of pressure values at different sensor locations. Sparsity is the main condition allowing to recover the photoacoustic (PA) source from compressive measurements. In this paper we introduce a new concept enabling sparse recovery in CS PAT. Our approach is based on the fact that the second time derivative applied to the measured pressure data corresponds to the application of the Laplacian to the original PA source. As typical PA sources consist of smooth parts and singularities along interfaces the Laplacian of the source is sparse (or at least compressible). To efficiently exploit the induced sparsity we develop a reconstruction framework to jointly recover the initial and the modified sparse source. Reconstruction results with simulated as well as experimental data are given.;math.NA
1801.00120;Asymptotic expansion of Skorohod integrals;Asymptotic expansion of the distribution of a perturbation $Z_n$ of a Skorohod integral jointly with a reference variable $X_n$ is derived. We introduce a second-order interpolation formula in frequency domain to expand a characteristic functional and combine it with the scheme developed in the martingale expansion. The second-order interpolation and Fourier inversion give asymptotic expansion of the expectation $E[f(Z_n,X_n)]$ for differentiable functions $f$ and also measurable functions $f$. In the latter case, the interpolation method connects the two non-degeneracies of variables for finite $n$ and $\infty$. Random symbols are used for expressing the asymptotic expansion formula. Quasi tangent, quasi torsion and modified quasi torsion are introduced in this paper. We identify these random symbols for a certain quadratic form of a fractional Brownian motion and for a quadratic from of a fractional Brownian motion with random weights. For a quadratic form of a Brownian motion with random weights, we observe that our formula reproduces the formula originally obtained by the martingale expansion.;math.PR
1801.00121;Resource Allocation for Downlink NOMA Systems: Key Techniques and Open Issues;This article presents advances in resource allocation (RA) for downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems, focusing on user pairing (UP) and power allocation (PA) algorithms. The former pairs the users to obtain the high capacity gain by exploiting the channel gain difference between the users, while the later allocates power to users in each cluster to balance system throughput and user fairness. Additionally, the article introduces the concept of cluster fairness and proposes the divideand- next largest difference-based UP algorithm to distribute the capacity gain among the NOMA clusters in a controlled manner. Furthermore, performance comparison between multiple-input multiple-output NOMA (MIMO-NOMA) and MIMO-OMA is conducted when users have pre-defined quality of service. Simulation results are presented, which validate the advantages of NOMA over OMA. Finally, the article provides avenues for further research on RA for downlink NOMA.;cs.IT
1801.00123;Frobenius manifolds and quantum groups;We introduce isomonodromy Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) connections with respect to the quantum Stokes matrices, and prove that the classical limit of the KZ type connections gives rise to the Dubrovin connections of semisimple Frobenius manifolds and flat F-manifolds.;math-ph
1801.00124;Escaping Fatou components of transcendental self-maps of the punctured plane;We study the iteration of transcendental self-maps of $\mathbb{C}^*:=\mathbb{C}\setminus \{0\}$, that is, holomorphic functions $f:\mathbb{C}^*\to\mathbb{C}^*$ for which both zero and infinity are essential singularities. We use approximation theory to construct functions in this class with escaping Fatou components, both wandering domains and Baker domains, that accumulate to $\{0,\infty\}$ in any possible way under iteration. We also give the first explicit examples of transcendental self-maps of $\mathbb{C}^*$ with Baker domains and with wandering domains. In doing so, we developed a sufficient condition for a function to have a simply connected escaping wandering domain. Finally, we remark that our results also provide new examples of entire functions with escaping Fatou components.;math.DS
1801.00131;On the structure of zero-sum free set with minimum subset sums in abelian groups;Let $G$ be an additive abelian group and $S\subset G$ a subset. Let $\Sigma(S)$ denote the set of group elements which can be expressed as a sum of a nonempty subset of $S$. We say $S$ is zero-sum free if $0 \not\in \Sigma(S)$. It was conjectured by R.B.~Eggleton and P.~Erd\"{o}s in 1972 and proved by W.~Gao et. al. in 2008 that $|\Sigma(S)|\geq 19$ provided that $S$ is a zero-sum free subset of an abelian group $G$ with $|S|=6$. In this paper, we determined the structure of zero-sum free set $S$ where $|S|=6$ and $|\Sigma(S)|=19$.;math.CO
1801.00137;Frequency-driven market mechanisms for optimal dispatch in power networks;This paper studies real-time bidding mechanisms for economic dispatch and frequency regulation in electrical power networks. We consider a market administered by an independent system operator (ISO) where a group of strategic generators participate in a Bertrand game of competition. Generators bid prices at which they are willing to produce electricity. Each generator aims to maximize their profit, while the ISO seeks to minimize the total generation cost and to regulate the frequency of the system. We consider a continuous-time bidding process coupled with the swing dynamics of the network through the use of frequency as a feedback signal for the negotiation process. We analyze the stability of the resulting interconnected system, establishing frequency regulation and the convergence to a Nash equilibrium and optimal generation levels. The results are verified in the IEEE 14-bus benchmark case.;math.OC

We show that, contrary to the autonomous systems on the compact interval, positivity of topological sequence entropy and occurrence of Li-Yorke chaos are not equivalent, more precisely, neither of the two possible implications is true.;math.DS
1801.00140;Moment measures and stability for Gaussian inequalities;Let $\gamma$ be the standard Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and let $\mathcal{P}_{\gamma}$ be the space of probability measures that are absolutely continuous with respect to $\gamma$. We study lower bounds for the functional $\mathcal{F}_{\gamma}(\mu) = {\rm Ent}(\mu) - \frac{1}{2} W^2_2(\mu, \nu)$, where $\mu \in \mathcal{P}_{\gamma}, \nu \in \mathcal{P}_{\gamma}$, ${\rm Ent}(\mu) = \int \log\bigl( \frac{\mu}{\gamma}\bigr) d \mu$ is the relative Gaussian entropy, and $W_2$ is the quadratic Kantorovich distance. The minimizers of $\mathcal{F}_{\gamma}$ are solutions to a dimension-free Gaussian analog of the (real) K\"ahler-Einstein equation. We show that $\mathcal{F}_{\gamma}(\mu) $ is bounded from below under the assumption that the Gaussian Fisher information of $\nu$ is finite and prove a priori estimates for the minimizers. Our approach relies on certain stability estimates for the Gaussian log-Sobolev and Talagrand transportation inequalities.;math.FA
1801.00143;Paired wreaths: towards a 2-categorical atlas of cross products;After we introduced biwreaths and biwreath-like objects in our previous paper, in the present one we define paired wreaths. In a paired wreath there is a monad $B$ and a comonad $F$ over the same 0-cell in a 2-category $\K$, so that $F$ is a left wreath around $B$ and $B$ is a right cowreath around $F$, and moreover, $FB$ is a bimonad in $\K$. The corresponding 1-cell $FB$ in the setting of a biwreath and a biwreath-like object was not necessarilly a bimonad. We obtain a 2-categorical version of the Radford biproduct and Sweedler's crossed (co)product, that are on one hand, both a biwreath and a biwreath-like object, respectively, and on the other hand, they are also paired wreaths. We show that many known crossed (bi)products in the literature are special cases of paired wreaths, including cocycle cross product bialgebras of Bespalov and Drabant in braided monoidal categories. This is a part of a project of constructing a kind of a 2-categorical atlas of all the known crossed (bi)products. We introduce a Hopf datum in $\K$ which contains part of the structure of a paired wreath. We define Yang-Baxter equations and naturality conditions of certain distributive laws in $\K$ and study when Hopf data are paired wreaths. From the notion of a Hopf datum new definitions of Yetter-Drinfel`d modules, (co)module (co)monads, 2-(co)cycles and (co)cycle twisted (co)actions in a 2-categorical setting are suggested.;math.QA
1801.00144;Ground-state energy of one-dimensional free Fermi gases in the thermodynamic limit;We study the ground-state energy of one-dimensional, non-interacting fermions subject to an external potential in the thermodynamic limit. To this end, we fix some (Fermi) energy $\nu&gt,0$, confine fermions with total energy below $\nu$ inside the interval $[-L,L]$ and study the shift of the ground-state energy due to the potential $V$ in the thermodynamic limit $L\to\infty$. We show that the difference $\mathcal{E}_L(\nu)$ of the two ground-state energies with and without potential can be decomposed into a term of order one (leading to the Fumi-term) and a term of order $1/L$, which yields the so-called finite size energy. We compute both terms for all possible boundary conditions explicitly and express them through the scattering data of the one-particle Schr\"odinger operator $-\Delta +V$ on $L^2(\mathbb R)$.;math-ph
1801.00145;Dynamic Interference Steering in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks;With the development of diverse wireless communication technologies, interference has become a key impediment in network performance, thus making effective interference management (IM) essential to accommodate a rapidly increasing number of subscribers with diverse services. Although there have been numerous IM schemes proposed thus far, none of them are free of some form of cost. It is, therefore, important to balance the benefit brought by and cost of each adopted IM scheme by adapting its operating parameters to various network deployments and dynamic channel conditions. <br />We propose a novel IM scheme, called dynamic interference steering (DIS), by recognizing the fact that interference can be not only suppressed or mitigated but also steered in a particular direction. Specifically, DIS exploits both channel state information (CSI) and the data contained in the interfering signal to generate a signal that modifies the spatial feature of the original interference to partially or fully cancel the interference appearing at the victim receiver. By intelligently determining the strength of the steering signal, DIS can steer the interference in an optimal direction to balance the transmitter's power used for IS and the desired signal's transmission. DIS is shown via simulation to be able to make better use of the transmit power, hence enhancing users' spectral efficiency (SE) effectively.;cs.IT
1801.00149;Inverse Exponential Decay: Stochastic Fixed Point Equation and ARMA Models;We study solutions to the stochastic fixed point equation $X\stackrel{d}{=}AX+B$ when the coefficients are nonnegative and $B$ is an "inverse exponential decay" (IED) random variable. We provide theorems on the left tail of $X$ which complement well-known tail results of Kesten and Goldie. We generalize our results to ARMA processes with nonnegative coefficients whose noise terms are from the IED class. We describe the lower envelope for these ARMA processes.;math.PR
1801.00150;On a scenario of onset of strongly dissipative mixed dynamics;In this paper we present the scenario of the occurrence of strongly dissipative mixed dynamics in two-dimensional reversible diffeomorphisms, using as an example the system describing a motion of two point vortices under the influence of wave perturbation and shear flow. For mixed dynamics of this type the chaotic attractor intersects with the chaotic repeller, but their intersection forms a "thin" set. The main stage of this scenario is the appearance of homoclinic structures for a symmetric saddle orbit which arise after crisis of a homoclinic attractor and repeller.;math.DS
1801.00151;Monads on projective varieties;We generalise Fl\o{}ystad's theorem on the existence of monads on the projective space to a larger set of projective varieties. We consider a variety $X$, a line bundle $L$ on $X$, and a base-point-free linear system of sections of $L$ giving a morphism to the projective space whose image is either arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay (ACM), or linearly normal and not contained in a quadric. We give necessary and sufficient conditions on integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ for a monad of type \[ 0\to(L^\vee)^a\to\mathcal{O}_{X}^{\,b}\to L^c\to0 \] to exist. We show that under certain conditions there exists a monad whose cohomology sheaf is simple. We furthermore characterise low-rank vector bundles that are the cohomology sheaf of some monad as above. <br />Finally, we obtain an irreducible family of monads over the projective space and make a description on how the same method could be used on an ACM smooth projective variety $X$. We establish the existence of a coarse moduli space of low-rank vector bundles over an odd-dimensional $X$ and show that in one case this moduli space is irreducible.;math.AG

1801.00156;Higher topological Hochschild homology of periodic complex K-theory;We describe the topological Hochschild homology of the periodic complex $K$-theory spectrum, $THH(KU)$, as a commutative $KU$-algebra: it is equivalent to $KU[K(\mathbb{Z},3)]$ and to $F(\Sigma KU_{\mathbb{Q}})$, where $F$ is the free commutative $KU$-algebra functor on a $KU$-module. Moreover, $F(\Sigma KU_{\mathbb{Q}})\simeq KU \vee \Sigma KU_{\mathbb{Q}}$, a square-zero extension. In order to prove these results, we first establish that topological Hochschild homology commutes, as an algebra, with localization at an element. <br />Then, we prove that $THH^n(KU)$, the $n$-fold iteration of $THH(KU)$, i.e. $T^n\otimes KU$, is equivalent to $KU[G]$ where $G$ is a certain product of integral Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces, and to a free commutative $KU$-algebra on a rational $KU$-module. We prove that $S^n \otimes KU$ is equivalent to $KU[K(\mathbb{Z},n+2)]$ and to $F(\Sigma^n KU_{\mathbb{Q}})$. We describe the topological Andr\'e-Quillen homology of $KU$.;math.AT
1801.00157;On the uniqueness of solutions to quadratic BSDEs with non-convex generators;In this paper we prove some uniqueness results for quadratic backward stochastic differential equations without any convexity assumptions on the generator. The bounded case is revisited while some new results are obtained in the unbounded case when the terminal condition and the generator depend on the path of a forward stochastic differential equation. Some of these results are based on strong estimates on $Z$ that are interesting on their own and could be applied in other situations.;math.PR
1801.00158;Symmetry breaking for representations of rank one orthogonal groups II;For a pair $(G,G')=(O(n+1,1), O(n,1))$ of reductive groups, we investigate intertwining operators (symmetry breaking operators) between principal series representations $I_\delta(V,\lambda)$ of $G$, and $J_\epsilon(W,\nu)$ of the subgroup $G'$. The representations are parametrized by finite-dimensional representations $V,W$ of $O(n)$ respectively of $O(n-1)$, characters $\delta$, $\varepsilon$ of O(1), and $\lambda, \nu \in C$. <br />The multiplicty [V:W] of W occurring in the restriction $V|_{O(n-1)}$ is either 0 or 1. If $[V:W] \ne 0$ then we construct a holomorphic family of symmetry breaking operators and prove that dim $Hom_{G'}(I_{\delta}(V, \lambda)|_{G'}, J_{\epsilon}(W, \nu))$ is nonzero for all the parameters $\lambda$, $\nu$ and $\delta$, $\epsilon$, whereas if [V:W] = 0 there may exist sporadic differential symmetry breaking operators. <br />We propose a "classification scheme" to find all matrix-valued symmetry breaking operators explicitly,and carry out this program completely when V and W are exterior tensor representations. In conformal geometry, our results yield the complete classification of conformal covariant operators from differential forms on a Riemannian manifold X to those on a submanifold Y in the model space $(X, Y) = (S^n, S^{n-1})$. <br />We use these results to determine symmetry breaking operators for any pair of irreducible representations of G and the subgroup $G'$ with trivial infinitesimal character. Furthermore we prove the multiplicity conjecture by Gross and Prasad for tempered principal series representations of $(SO(n+1,1),SO(n,1))$ and also for 3 tempered representations $\Pi, \pi, \varpi$ of $SO(2m+2,1)$, $SO(2m+1,1)$ and $SO(2m,1)$ with trivial infinitesimal character. In connection to automorphic form theory, we apply our main results to find "periods" of irreducible representations of the Lorentz group having nonzero (g, K)-cohomologies.;math.RT
1801.00163;On the cone of $f$-vectors of cubical polytopes;What is the minimal closed cone containing all $f$-vectors of cubical $d$-polytopes? We construct cubical polytopes showing that this cone, expressed in the cubical $g$-vector coordinates, contains the nonnegative $g$-orthant, thus verifying one direction of the Cubical Generalized Lower Bound Conjecture of Babson, Billera and Chan. Our polytopes also show that a natural cubical analogue of the simplicial Generalized Lower Bound Theorem does not hold.;math.CO
1801.00167;A Concentration Inequality for Random Polytopes, Dirichlet-Voronoi Tiling Numbers and the Geometric Balls and Bins Problem;Our main contribution is a concentration inequality for the symmetric volume difference of a $ C^2 $ convex body with positive Gaussian curvature and a circumscribed random polytope with a restricted number of facets, for any probability measure on the boundary with a positive density function. We also show that the Dirichlet-Voronoi tiling numbers satisfy $ \text{div}_{n-1} = (2\pi e)^{-1}(n+\ln n) + O(1)$, which improves a classical result of Zador by a factor of $o(n)$. In addition, we provide a remarkable open problem which is the natural geometric generalization of the famous and fundamental "balls and bins" problem from probability. This problem is tightly connected to the optimality of random polytopes in high dimensions.;math.MG
1801.00170;Robust affine control of linear stochastic systems;In this work we provide a computationally tractable procedure for designing affine control policies, applied to constrained, discrete-time, partially observable, linear systems subject to set bounded disturbances, stochastic noise and potentially Markovian switching over a finite horizon. <br />We investigate the situation when performance specifications are expressed via averaged quadratic inequalities on the random state-control trajectory. Our methodology also applies to steering the density of the state-control trajectory under set bounded uncertainty. Our developments are based on expanding the notion of affine policies that are functions of the so-called "purified outputs", to the class of Markov jump linear systems. This re-parametrization of the set of policies, induces a bi-affine structure in the state and control variables that can further be exploited via robust optimization techniques, with the approximate inhomogeneous $S$-lemma being the cornerstone. Tractability is understood in the sense that for each type of performance specification considered, an explicit convex program for selecting the parameters specifying the control policy is provided. <br />Our contributions to the existing literature on the subject of robust constrained control lies in the fact that we are addressing a wider class of systems than the ones already studied, by including Markovian switching, and the consideration of quadratic inequalities rather than just linear ones. Our work expands on the previous investigations on finite horizon covariance control by addressing the robustness issue and the possibility that the full state may not be available, therefore enabling the steering of the state-control trajectory density in the presence of disturbances under partial observation.;math.OC
1801.00172;The Allocation of a Variable Series Reactor Considering AC Constraints and Contingencies;The Variable Series Reactors (VSRs) can efficiently control the power flow through the adjustment of the line reactance. When they are appropriately allocated in the power network, the transmission congestion and generation cost can be reduced. This paper proposes a planning model to optimally allocate VSRs considering AC constraints and multi-scenarios including base case and contingencies. The planning model is originally a non-convex large scale mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is generally intractable. The proposed Benders approach decomposes the MINLP model into a mixed integer linear program (MILP) master problem and a number of nonlinear subproblems. Numerical case studies based on IEEE 118-bus demonstrate the high performance of the proposed approach.;math.OC
1801.00177;Conservation of energy for the Euler-Korteweg equations;In this article we study the principle of energy conservation for the Euler-Korteweg system. We formulate an Onsager-type sufficient regularity condition for weak solutions of the Euler-Korteweg system to conserve the total energy. The result applies to the system of Quantum Hydrodynamics.;math.AP
1801.00179;n-Arc Connected Graphs;Given a graph G, of arbitrary size and unbounded vertex degree, denote by |G| the one-complex associated with $G$. The topological space |G| is n-arc connected (n-ac) if every set of no more than n points of |G| are contained in an arc (a homeomorphic copy of the closed unit interval). <br />For any graph G, we show the following are equivalent: (i) |G| in 7-ac, (ii) |G| is n-ac for all n, and (iii) G is a subdivision of one of nine graphs. A graph G has |G| 6-ac if and only if either G is one of the nine 7-ac graphs, or, after suppressing all degree-2-vertices, the graph G is 3-regular, 3-connected, and removing any 6 edges does not disconnect G into 4 or more components. <br />Similar combinatorial characterizations of graphs G such that |G| is n-ac for n=3, 4 and 5 are given. Together these results yield a complete classification of n-ac graphs, for all n.;math.CO
1801.00186;Norm Estimates for $k$-Plane Transforms and Geometric Inequalities;The article is devoted to remarkable interrelation between the norm estimates for $k$-plane transforms in weighted and unweighted $L^p$ spaces and geometric integral inequalities for cross-sections of measurable sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We also consider more general $j$-plane to $k$-plane transforms on affine Grassmannians and their compact modifications. The article contains a series of new integral-geometric inequalities with sharp constants, explicit equalities, conjectures, and open problems.;math.MG
1801.00188;Coefficients of Gaussian Polynomials Modulo $N$;The $q$-analogue of the binomial coefficient, known as a $q$-binomial coefficient, is typically denoted $\left[{n \atop k}\right]_q$. These polynomials are important combinatorial objects, often appearing in generating functions related to permutations and in representation theory. Stanley conjectured that the function $f_{k,R}(n) = \#\left\{i : [q^{i}] \left[{n \atop k}\right]_q \equiv R \pmod{N}\right\}$ is quasipolynomial for $N=2$. We generalize, showing that this is in fact true for any integer $N\in \mathbb{N}$ and determine a quasi-period $\pi'_N(k)$ derived from the minimal period $\pi_N(k)$ of partitions with at most $k$ parts modulo $N$.;math.CO
1801.00191;Categorical diagonalization of full twists;We conjecture that the complex of Soergel bimodules associated with the full twist braid is categorically diagonalizable, for any finite Coxeter group. This utilizes the theory of categorical diagonalization introduced earlier by the authors. We prove our conjecture in type $A$, and as a result we obtain a categorification of the Young idempotents.;math.RT
1801.00193;Free resolutions of orbit closures of Dynkin quivers;We use the Kempf-Lascoux-Weyman geometric technique in order to determine the minimal free resolutions of some orbit closures of quivers. As a consequence, we obtain that for Dynkin quivers orbit closures of 1-step representations are normal with rational singularities. For Dynkin quivers of type $A$, we describe explicit minimal generators of the defining ideals of orbit closures of 1-step representations. Using this, we provide an algorithm for type $A$ quivers for describing an efficient set of generators of the defining ideal of the orbit closure of any representation.;math.AG
1801.00195;Mittag-Leffler function and fractional differential equations;We adopt a procedure of operational-umbral type to solve the $(1+1)$-dimensional fractional Fokker-Planck equation in which time fractional derivative of order $\alpha$ ($0 &lt, \alpha &lt, 1$) is in the Riemann-Liouville sense. The technique we propose merges well documented operational methods to solve ordinary FP equation and a redefinition of the time by means of an umbral operator. We show that the proposed method allows significant progress including the handling of operator ordering.;math-ph
1801.00197;A Priori Error Estimates for Finite Element Approximations to Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami Operator;Elliptic partial differential equations on surfaces play an essential role in geometry, relativity theory, phase transitions, materials science, image processing, and other applications. They are typically governed by the Laplace-Beltrami operator. We present and analyze approximations by Surface Finite Element Methods (SFEM) of the Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalue problem. As for SFEM for source problems, spectral approximation is challenged by two sources of errors: the geometric consistency error due to the approximation of the surface and the Galerkin error corresponding to finite element resolution of eigenfunctions. We show that these two error sources interact for eigenfunction approximations as for the source problem. The situation is different for eigenvalues, where a novel situation occurs for the geometric consistency error: The degree of the geometric error depends on the choice of interpolation points used to construct the approximate surface. Thus the geometric consistency term can sometimes be made to converge faster than in the eigenfunction case through a judicious choice of interpolation points.;math.NA
1801.00199;Existence and concentration results for some fractional Schr&#xf6,dinger equations in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ with magnetic fields;We consider some nonlinear fractional Schr\"odinger equations with magnetic field and involving continuous nonlinearities having subcritical, critical or supercritical growth. Under a local condition on the potential, we use minimax methods to investigate the existence and concentration of nontrivial weak solutions.;math.AP
1801.00200;Decomposition matrices for the generic Hecke algebras on 3 strands in characteristic 0;We classify all the decomposition matrices of the generic Hecke algebras on 3 strands in characteristic 0. These are the generic Hecke algebras associated to the exceptional complex reflection groups $G_4$, $G_8$ and $G_{16}$. We prove that for every choice of the parameters that define these algebras, all ordinary representations are obtained as modular reductions of irreducible representations.;math.RT
1801.00204;Filled Julia set of some class of H&#xe9,non-like map;In this work we consider a class of endomorphisms of $\mathbb{R}^2$ defined by $f(x,y)=(xy+c,x)$, where $c\in\mathbb{R}$ is a real number and we prove that when $-1&lt,c&lt,0$, the forward filled Julia set of $f$ is the union of stable manifolds of fixed and $3-$periodic points of $f$. We also prove that the backward filled Julia set of $f$ is the union of unstable manifolds of the saddle fixed and $3-$periodic points of $f$.;math.DS
1801.00207;The $Z$-Dirac and massive Laplacian operators in the $Z$-invariant Ising model;Consider an elliptic parameter $k$, we introduce a family of $Z^u$-Dirac operators $(\mathsf{K}(u))_{u\in\Re(\mathbb{T}(k))}$, relate them to the $Z$-massive Laplacian of [BdTR17b], and extend to the full $Z$-invariant case the results of Kenyon [Ken02] on discrete holomorphic and harmonic functions, which correspond to the case $k=0$. We prove, in a direct statistical mechanics way, how and why the $Z^u$-Dirac and $Z$-massive Laplacian operators appear in the $Z$-invariant Ising model, considering the case of infinite and finite isoradial graphs. More precisely, consider the dimer model on the Fisher graph ${\mathsf{G}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathrm{F}}}$ arising from a $Z$-invariant Ising model. We express coefficients of the inverse Fisher Kasteleyn operator as a function of the inverse $Z^u$-Dirac operator and also as a function of the $Z$-massive Green function, in particular this proves a (massive) random walk representation of important observables of the Ising model. We prove that the squared partition function of the Ising model is equal, up to a constant, to the determinant of the $Z$-massive Laplacian operator with specific boundary conditions, the latter being the partition function of rooted spanning forests. To show these results, we relate the inverse Fisher Kasteleyn operator and that of the dimer model on the bipartite graph ${\mathsf{G}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathrm{Q}}}$ arising from the XOR-Ising model, and we prove matrix identities between the Kasteleyn matrix of ${\mathsf{G}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathrm{Q}}}$ and the $Z^u$-Dirac operator, that allow to reach inverse matrices as well as determinants.;math-ph
1801.00208;KP theory, plabic networks in the disk and rational degenerations of M--curves;We complete the program of Ref. [3,5] of connecting totally non-negative Grassmannians to the reality problem in KP finite-gap theory via the assignment of real regular divisors on rational degenerations of M-curves for the class of real regular multi-line soliton solutions of KP II equation whose asymptotic behavior has been combinatorially characterized by Chakravarthy, Kodama and Williams. We use the plabic networks in the disk introduced by Postnikov to parametrize positroid cells in totally nonnegative Grassmannians. The boundary of the disk corresponds to the rational curve associated to the soliton data in the direct spectral problem, and the bicolored graph is the dual of a reducible curve G which is the rational degeneration of a regular M-curve whose genus g equals the number of faces of the network diminished by one. We assign systems of edge vectors to the planar bicolored networks. The system of relations satisfied by them has maximal rank and may be reformulated in the form of edge signatures.. We prove that the components of the edge vectors are rational in the edge weights with subtraction free denominators and provide their explicit expressions in terms of conservative and edge flows. The edge vectors rule the value of the KP wave function at the double points of G, whereas the signatures at the vertices rule the position of the divisor in the ovals. We prove that the divisor satisfies the conditions of Dubrovin-Natanzon for real finite-gap solutions: there is exactly one divisor point in each oval except for the one containing the essential singularity of the wave function. The divisor may be explicitly computed using the linear relations at the vertices of the network. We explain the role of moves and reductions in the transformation of both the curve and the divisor for given soliton data, and apply our construction to some examples.;math-ph
1801.00210;A study of elliptic gamma function and allies;We study analytic and arithmetic properties of the elliptic gamma function $$ \prod_{m,n=0}^\infty\frac{1-x^{-1}q^{m+1}p^{n+1}}{1-xq^mp^n}, \qquad |q|,|p|&lt,1, $$ in the regime $p=q$, in particular, its connection with the elliptic dilogarithm and a formula of S. Bloch. We further extend the results to more general products by linking them to non-holomorphic Eistenstein series and, via some formulae of D. Zagier, to elliptic polylogarithms.;math.NT
1801.00212;Benford&#x27,s Law Beyond Independence: Tracking Benford Behavior in Copula Models;Benford's law describes a common phenomenon among many naturally occurring data sets and distributions in which the leading digits of the data are distributed with the probability of a first digit of $d$ base $B$ being $\log_{B}{\frac{d+1}{d}}$. As it often successfully detects fraud in medical trials, voting, science and finance, significant effort has been made to understand when and how distributions exhibit Benford behavior. Most of the previous work has been restricted to cases of independent variables, and little is known about situations involving dependence. We use copulas to investigate the Benford behavior of the product of $n$ dependent random variables. We develop a method for approximating the Benford behavior of a product of $n$ dependent random variables modeled by a copula distribution $C$ and quantify and bound a copula distribution's distance from Benford behavior. We then investigate the Benford behavior of various copulas under varying dependence parameters and number of marginals. Our investigations show that the convergence to Benford behavior seen with independent random variables as the number of variables in the product increases is not necessarily preserved when the variables are dependent and modeled by a copula. Furthermore, there is strong indication that the preservation of Benford behavior of the product of dependent random variables may be linked more to the structure of the copula than to the Benford behavior of the marginal distributions.;math.PR
1801.00214;Partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms homotopic to the identity on 3-manifolds;We announce some results towards the classification of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms on 3-manifolds, and outline the proofs in the case when the diffeomorphism is dynamically coherent. Detailed proofs are long and technical and will appear later.;math.DS
1801.00219;Liftings of pseudo-reflection groups of toric quotients of Krull schemes;Let $G$ be an affine algebraic group with a reductive identity component $G^{0}$ acting regularly on an affine Krull scheme $X = {Spec} (R)$ over an algebraically closed field. Let $T$ be an algebraic subtorus of $G$ and suppose that ${Q}(R)^{T}= {Q}(R^{T})$ of quotient fields. We will show: If $G$ is the centralizer of $T$ in $G$, then the pseudo-reflections of the action of $G$ on $R^{T}$ can be lifted to those on $R$.;math.GR
1801.00222;Limitation of SDMA in Ultra-Dense Small Cell Networks;Benefitting from multi-user gain brought by multi-antenna techniques, space division multiple access (SDMA) is capable of significantly enhancing spatial throughput (ST) in wireless networks. Nevertheless, we show in this letter that, even when SDMA is applied, ST would diminish to be zero in ultra-dense networks (UDN), where small cell base stations (BSs) are fully densified. More importantly, we compare the performance of SDMA, single-user beamforming (SU-BF) (one user is served in each cell) and full SDMA (the number of served users equals the number of equipped antennas). Surprisingly, it is shown that SU-BF achieves the highest ST and critical density, beyond which ST starts to degrade, in UDN. The results in this work could shed light on the fundamental limitation of SDMA in UDN.;cs.IT

1801.00226;Quantifier elimination on some pseudo-algebraically closed valued fields;Adjoining to the language of rings the function symbols for splitting coefficients, the function symbols for relative $p$-coordinate functions, and the division predicate for a valuation, some theories of pseudo-algebraically closed non-trivially valued fields admit quantifier elimination. It is also shown that in the same language the theory of pseudo-algebraically closed non-trivially valued fields of a given exponent of imperfection does not admit quantifier elimination, due to Galois theoretic obstructions.;math.LO
1801.00229;On counting certain abelian varieties over finite fields;This paper contains two parts toward studying abelian varieties from the classification point of view. In a series of papers, the current authors and T.-C. Yang obtain explicit formulas for the numbers of superspecial abelian surfaces over finite fields. In this paper, we give an explicit formula for the size of the isogeny class of simple abelian surfaces with real Weil number $\sqrt{q}$. This establishes a key step that one may extend our previous explicit calculations of superspecial abelian surfaces to those of supersingular abelian surfaces.The second part is to introduce the notion of genera and ideal complexes of abelian varieties with additional structures in a general setting. The purpose is to generalize the results of Yu on abelian varieties with additional structures to similitude classes, which establishes more results on the connection between geometrically defined and arithmetically defined masses for further investigation.;math.NT
1801.00230;Idempotents in Tangle Categories Split;In this paper we use 3-manifold techniques to illuminate the structure of the category of tangles.

1801.00231;Mean-Square Approximation of Iterated Ito and Stratonovich Stochastic Integrals of Multiplicities 1 to 6 from the Taylor-Ito and Taylor-Stratonovich Expansions Using Legendre Polynomials;The article is devoted to the practical material on expansions and mean-square approximations of specific iterated Ito and Stratonovich stochastic integrals of multiplicities 1 to 6 with respect to components of the multidimensional Wiener process on the base of the method of generalized multiple Fourier series. More precisely, we used the multiple Fourier--Legendre series converging in the sense of norm in the space $L_2([t, T]^k)$ $(k=1,\ldots,6)$ for approximation of iterated Ito and Stratonovich stochastic integrals. The considered iterated Ito and Stratonovich stochastic integrals are part of the stochastic Taylor expansions (Taylor-Ito and Taylor-Stratonovich expansions). Therefore, the results of the article can be useful for construction of the high-order strong numerical methods for Ito stochastic differential equations. Expansions of iterated Ito and Stratonovich stochastic integrals of multiplicities 1 to 6 using Legendre polynomials are derived. The convergence with probability 1 of the mentioned method of generalized multiple Fourier series is proved for iterated Ito stochastic integrals of multiplicities $k$ $(k\in\mathbb{N})$ for the cases of multiple Fourier-Legendre series and multiple trigonometric Fourier series.;math.PR
1801.00232;Stabilization of the weakly coupled wave-plate system with one internal damping;This paper is addressed to a stabilization problem of a system coupled by a wave and a Euler-Bernoulli plate equation. Only one equation is supposed to be damped. Under some assumption about the damping and the coupling terms, it is shown that sufficiently smooth solutions of the system decay logarithmically at infinity without any geometric conditions on the effective damping domain. The proofs of these decay results rely on the interpolation inequalities for the coupled elliptic-parabolic systems and make use of the estimate of the resolvent operator for the coupled system. The main tools to derive the desired interpolation inequalities are global Carleman estimates.;math.OC
1801.00234;Unstable modes in projection-based reduced-order models: How many can there be, and what do they tell you?;Projection methods provide an appealing way to construct reduced-order models of large-scale linear dynamical systems: they are intuitively motivated and fairly easy to compute. Unfortunately, the resulting reduced models need not inherit the stability of the original system. How many unstable modes can these reduced models have? This note investigates this question, using theory originally motivated by iterative methods for linear algebraic systems and eigenvalue problems, and illustrating the theory with a number of small examples. From these results follow rigorous upper bounds on the number of unstable modes in reduced models generated via orthogonal projection, for both continuous- and discrete-time systems. Can anything be learned from the unstable modes in reduced-order models? Several examples illustrate how such instability can helpfully signal transient growth in the original system.;math.NA
1801.00236;On closed subalgebras of CB(X);For a completely regular space $X$ and a non-vanishing self-adjoint closed subalgebra $H$ of $C_B(X)$ which separates points from closed sets in $X$ we construct the Gelfand spectrum $\mathfrak{sp}(H)$ of $H$ as an open subspace of the compactification of $X$ generated by $H$. The simple construction of $\mathfrak{sp}(H)$ enables easier examination of its properties. We illustrate this by an example showing that the space $\mathfrak{sp}(H)$ is separable metrizable if and only if $H$ is countably generated.;math.FA
1801.00238;Cardinal characteristics of the continuum and partitions;We prove combinatorial theorems concerning the stick principle and cardinal characteristics.;math.LO
1801.00239;The first omitting cardinal for Magidority;We prove that $\alpha_M(\lambda)$ can be successor of a supercompact cardinal, when $\lambda$ is a Magidor cardinal. From this result we obtain the consistency of $\alpha_M(\lambda)$ being a successor of a singular cardinal with uncountable cofinality.;math.LO
1801.00240;Uniform modular lattices and affine buildings;In this paper, we present a simple lattice-theoretic characterization for affine buildings of type A. We introduce a class of modular lattices, called uniform modular lattices, and show that uniform modular lattices and affine buildings of type A constitute the same object. This is an affine counterpart of the well-known equivalence between projective geometries ($\simeq$ complemented modular lattices) and spherical buildings of type A.;math.CO
1801.00241;Isometric Embedding and Darboux Integrability;Given a smooth 2-dimensional Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifold $(M, \boldsymbol{g})$ and an ambient 3-dimensional Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifold $(N, \boldsymbol{h})$, one can ask under what circumstances does the exterior differential system $\mathcal{I}$ for the isometric embedding $M\hookrightarrow N$ have particularly nice solvability properties. In this paper we give a classification of all $2$-metrics $\boldsymbol{g}$ whose local isometric embedding system into flat Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian 3-manifolds $(N, \boldsymbol{h})$ is Darboux integrable. As an illustration of the motivation behind the classification, we examine in detail one of the classified metrics, $\boldsymbol{g}_0$, showing how to use its Darboux integrability in order to construct all its embeddings in finite terms of arbitrary functions. Additionally, the geometric Cauchy problem for the embedding of $\boldsymbol{g}_0$ is shown to be reducible to a system of two first-order ODEs for two unknown functions---or equivalently, to a single second-order scalar ODE. For a large class of initial data, this reduction permits explicit solvability of the geometric Cauchy problem for $\boldsymbol{g}_0$ up to quadrature. The results described for $\boldsymbol{g}_0$ also hold for any classified metric whose embedding system is hyperbolic.;math.DG
1801.00242;Estimating symplectic capacities from lengths of closed curves on the unit spheres;We improve the estimates for the Ekeland--Hofer--Zehnder capacity of convex bodies by Gluskin and Ostrover. In the course of our argument we show that a closed characteristic of minimal action on the boundary of a centrally symmetric convex body in $\mathbb R^{2n}$ must itself be centrally symmetric, with generalizations to some other types of symmetry.;math.MG
1801.00245;On R-matrix valued Lax pairs for Calogero-Moser models;The article is devoted to the study of $R$-matrix-valued Lax pairs for $N$-body (elliptic) Calogero-Moser models. Their matrix elements are given by quantum ${\rm GL}_{\tilde N}$ $R$-matrices of Baxter-Belavin type. For $\tilde N=1$ the widely known Krichever's Lax pair with spectral parameter is reproduced. First, we construct the $R$-matrix-valued Lax pairs for Calogero-Moser models associated with classical root systems. For this purpose we study generalizations of the D'Hoker-Phong Lax pairs. It appeared that in the $R$-matrix-valued case the Lax pairs exist in special cases only. The number of quantum spaces (on which $R$-matrices act) and their dimension depend on the values of coupling constants. Some of the obtained classical Lax pairs admit straightforward extension to the quantum case. In the end we describe a relationship of the $R$-matrix-valued Lax pairs to Hitchin systems defined on ${\rm SL}_{N\tilde N}$ bundles with nontrivial characteristic classes over elliptic curve. We show that the classical analogue of the anisotropic spin exchange operator entering the $R$-matrix-valued Lax equations is reproduced in these models.;math-ph
1801.00246;A GPU Accelerated Discontinuous Galerkin Incompressible Flow Solver;We present a GPU-accelerated version of a high-order discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The equations are discretized in time using a semi-implicit scheme with explicit treatment of the nonlinear term and implicit treatment of the split Stokes operators. The pressure system is solved with a conjugate gradient method together with a fully GPU-accelerated multigrid preconditioner which is designed to minimize memory requirements and to increase overall performance. A semi-Lagrangian subcycling advection algorithm is used to shift the computational load per timestep away from the pressure Poisson solve by allowing larger timestep sizes in exchange for an increased number of advection steps. Numerical results confirm we achieve the design order accuracy in time and space. We optimize the performance of the most time-consuming kernels by tuning the fine-grain parallelism, memory utilization, and maximizing bandwidth. To assess overall performance we present an empirically calibrated roofline performance model for a target GPU to explain the achieved efficiency. We demonstrate that, in the most cases, the kernels used in the solver are close to their empirically predicted roofline performance.;math.NA
1801.00247;Spin Structures and Branch Divisors on $p$-gonal Riemann surfaces;We study spin structures on Riemann and Klein surfaces in terms of divisors. In particular, we take a closer look at spin structures on hyperelliptic and $p$-gonal surfaces defined by divisors supported on their branch points. Moreover, we study invariant spin divisors under automorphisms and anti-holomorphic involutions of Riemann surfaces.;math.CV
1801.00249;Tiling enumeration of doubly-intruded halved hexagons;Inspired by Propp's intruded Aztec diamond regions, we consider halved hexagons in which two aligned arrays of triangular holes have been removed from their boundaries. Unlike the intruded Aztec diamonds (whose numbers of domino tilings contain some large prime factors in their factorizations), the numbers of lozenge tilings of our doubly-intruded halved hexagons are given by simple product formulas in which all factors are linear in the parameters. In this paper, we present an extensive list of exact tiling enumerations of sixteen different types of doubly-intruded halved hexagons. We also prove that the lozenge tilings of a symmetric hexagon with three arrays of triangles removed are always enumerated by a closed-form product formula. Our results generalize several previous works, including Proctor's enumeration of the transposed-complementary plane partitions, related work of Ciucu, and recent generalizations of Rohatgi and of the author.;math.CO
1801.00258;Distributed Observers Design for Leader-Following Control of Multi-Agent Networks (Extended Version);This paper is concerned with a leader-follower problem for a multi-agent system with a switching interconnection topology. Distributed observers are designed for the second-order follower-agents, under the common assumption that the velocity of the active leader cannot be measured in real time. Some dynamic neighbor-based rules, consisting of distributed controllers and observers for the autonomous agents, are developed to keep updating the information of the leader. With the help of an explicitly constructed common Lyapunov function (CLF), it is proved that each agent can follow the active leader. Moreover, the tracking error is estimated even in a noisy environment. Finally, a numerical example is given for illustration.;math.OC
1801.00261;First-Order Primal-Dual Method for Nonlinear Convex Cone Programming;Nonlinear Convex Cone Programming (NCCP) problems are important and have many practical applications. In this paper, we introduces a flexible first-order primal-dual algorithm called the Variant Auxiliary Problem Principle (VAPP) for solving NCCP problems when the objective function and constraints are smooth and may be nonsmooth. Each iteration of VAPP generates a nonlinear approximation to the primal problem of an augmented Lagrangian method. The approximation incorporates both linearization and a variable distance-like function, and then the iterations of VAPP provide one decomposition property for NCCP. Motivated by recent applications in big data analysis, there has been an explosive growth in interest in the convergence rate analysis of parallel computing algorithms for large scale optimization problem. This paper proposes an iteration-based error bound and linear convergence of VAPP. Some verifiable sufficient conditions of this error bound are also discussed. For the general convex case (without error bound), we establish $O(1/t)$ convergence rate for primal suboptimality, feasibility and dual suboptimality. By adaptively setting in parameters at different iterations, we show an $O(1/t^2)$ rate for the strongly convex case. We further present Forward-Backward Splitting (FBS) formulation of VAPP method and establish the connection between VAPP and other primal-dual splitting methods. Finally, we discuss some issues in the implementation of VAPP.;math.OC
1801.00265;Semisimple characters for inner forms II: Quaternionic inner forms of classical groups;In this article we consider a quaternionic inner form $G$ of a $p$-adic classical group defined over a non-archimedian local field of odd residue characteristic. We construct all full self-dual semisimple characters for $G$ and we classify their intertwining classes using endo-parameters. Further we prove an intertwining and conjugacy theorem for self-dual semisimple characters. We give the formulas for the set of intertwiners between self-dual semisimple characters. We count all $G$-intertwining classes of self-dual semisimple characters which lift to the same $\tilde{G}$-intertwining class of a semisimple character for the ambient general linear group $\tilde{G}$ for $G$.;math.RT
1801.00267;On hereditarily just infinite profinite groups with complete Hausdorff dimension spectrum;We prove that the inverse limit of certain iterated wreath products in product action have complete Hausdorff dimension spectrum with respect to their unique maximal filtration of open normal subgroups. Moreover we can produce explicitly subgroups with a specified Hausdorff dimension.;math.GR
1801.00268;On the Quantum-Mechanics of a Single Photon;It is shown that a Dirac(-type) equation for a rank-two bi-spinor field on Minkowski (configuration) spacetime furnishes a Lorentz-covariant quantum-mechanical wave equation in position-space representation for a single free photon. This equation does not encounter any of the roadblocks that have obstructed previous attempts (by various authors) to formulate a {quantum-mechanical} photon wave equation. In particular, it implies that the photon wave function yields conserved non-negative Born-rule-type quantum probabilities, and that its probability current density four-vector transforms properly under Lorentz transformations. Moreover, the eigenvalues of the pertinent photon Dirac Hamiltonian and the vector eigenvalues of the photon momentum operator yield the familiar Einstein relations $E=\hbar\omega$ and ${\bf p}=\hbar{\bf k}$, respectively. Furthermore, these spin-1 wave modes are automatically transversal without the need of an additional constraint on the initial data. Some comments on other proposals to set up a photon wave equation are supplied as well.;math-ph
1801.00270;A Hermite WENO reconstruction for fourth order temporal accurate schemes based on the GRP solver for hyperbolic conservation laws;This paper develops a new fifth order accurate Hermite WENO (HWENO) reconstruction method for hyperbolic conservation schemes in the framework of the two-stage fourth order accurate temporal discretization in [{\em J. Li and Z. Du, A two-stage fourth order time-accurate discretization {L}ax--{W}endroff type flow solvers, {I}. {H}yperbolic conservation laws, SIAM, J. Sci. Comput., 38 (2016), pp.~A3046--A3069}]. Instead of computing the first moment of the solution additionally in the conventional HWENO or DG approach, we can directly take the {\em interface values}, which are already available in the numerical flux construction using the generalized Riemann problem (GRP) solver, to approximate the first moment. The resulting scheme is fourth order temporal accurate by only invoking the HWENO reconstruction twice so that it becomes more compact. Numerical experiments show that such compactness makes significant impact on the resolution of nonlinear waves.;math.NA
1801.00279;Partial quasi likelihood analysis;The quasi likelihood analysis is generalized to the partial quasi likelihood analysis. Limit theorems for the quasi likelihood estimators, especially the quasi Bayesian estimator, are derived in the situation where existence of a slow mixing component prohibits the Rosenthal type inequality from applying to the derivation of the polynomial type large deviation inequality for the statistical random field. We give two illustrative examples.;math.ST
1801.00287;Cubic threefolds and hyperk&#xe4,hler manifolds uniformized by the 10-dimensional complex ball;We first prove an isomorphism between the moduli space of smooth cubic threefolds and the moduli space of hyperkaehler fourfolds of K3^{[2]}-type with a non-symplectic automorphism of order three, whose invariant lattice has rank one and is generated by a class of square 6, both these spaces are uniformized by the same 10-dimensional arithmetic complex ball quotient. We then study the degeneration of the automorphism along the loci of nodal or chordal degenerations of the cubic threefold, showing the birationality of these loci with some moduli spaces of hyperkaehler fourfolds of K3^{[2]}-type with non-symplectic automorphism of order three belonging to different families. Finally, we construct a cyclic Pfaffian cubic fourfold to give an explicit construction of a non-natural automorphism of order three on the Hilbert square of a K3 surface.;math.AG
1801.00288;Boolean Dimension, Components and Blocks;We investigate the behavior of Boolean dimension with respect to components and blocks. To put our results in context, we note that for Dushnik-Miller dimension, we have that if $\dim(C)\le d$ for every component $C$ of a poset $P$, then $\dim(P)\le \max\{2,d\}$, also if $\dim(B)\le d$ for every block $B$ of a poset $P$, then $\dim(P)\le d+2$. By way of constrast, local dimension is well behaved with respect to components, but not for blocks: if $\text{ldim}(C)\le d$ for every component $C$ of a poset $P$, then $\text{ldim}(P)\le d+2$, however, for every $d\ge 4$, there exists a poset $P$ with $\text{ldim}(P)=d$ and $\dim(B)\le 3$ for every block $B$ of $P$. In this paper we show that Boolean dimension behaves like Dushnik-Miller dimension with respect to both components and blocks: if $\text{bdim}(C)\le d$ for every component $C$ of $P$, then $\text{bdim}(P)\le 2+d+4\cdot2^d$, also if $\text{bdim}(B)\le d$ for every block of $P$, then $\text{bdim}(P)\le 19+d+18\cdot 2^d$.;math.CO
1801.00291;A generalized Bartholdi zeta function formula for simple graphs with bounded degree;We introduce a generalized Bartholdi zeta function for simple graphs with bounded degree. This zeta function is a generalization of both the Bartholdi zeta function which was introduced by L.~Bartholdi and the Ihara zeta function which was introduced by G.~Chinta, J.~Jorgenson and A.~Karlsson. Furthermore, we establish a Bartholdi type formula of this Bartholdi zeta function for simple graphs with bounded degree. Moreover, for regular graphs, we give a new expression of the heat kernel which is regarded as a one-parameter deformation of the expression obtained by G.~Chinta, J.~Jorgenson and A.~Karlsson. By applying this formula, we give an alternative proof of the Bartholdi zeta function formula for regular graphs.;math.CO
1801.00295;Moutard transform for the conductivity equation;We construct Darboux-Moutard type transforms for the two-dimensional conductivity equation. This result continues our recent studies of Darboux-Moutard type transforms for generalized analytic functions. In addition, at least, some of the Darboux-Moutard type transforms of the present work admit direct extension to the conductivity equation in multidimensions. Relations to the Schr\"odinger equation at zero energy are also shown.;math-ph
1801.00296;Graph invariants and Betti numbers of real toric manifolds;For a graph $G$, a graph cubeahedron $\square_G$ and a graph associahedron $\triangle_G$ are simple convex polytopes which admit (real) toric manifolds. In this paper, we introduce a graph invariant, called the $b$-number, and we show that the $b$-numbers compute the Betti numbers of the real toric manifold $X^\mathbb{R}(\square_G)$ corresponding to a graph cubeahedron. The $b$-number is a counterpart of the notion of $a$-number, introduced by S. Choi and the second named author, which computes the Betti numbers of the real toric manifold $X^\mathbb{R}(\triangle_G)$ corresponding to a graph associahedron. We also study various relationships between $a$-numbers and $b$-numbers from a toric topological view. Interestingly, for a forest $G$ and its line graph $L(G)$, the real toric manifolds $X^\mathbb{R}(\triangle_G)$ and $X^\mathbb{R}(\square_{L(G)})$ have the same Betti numbers.;math.CO
1801.00302;Pure-minimal chain complexes;We introduce a notion of pure-minimality for chain complexes of modules and show that it coincides with (homotopic) minimality in standard settings, while being a more useful notion for complexes of flat modules. As applications, we characterize von Neumann regular rings and left perfect rings.;math.AC
1801.00303;An elementary proof of an isoperimetric inequality for paths with finite $p$-variation;In this article we will prove that if the continuous closed curve $\gamma : [0, 1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ has finite $p$-variation with $p &lt, 2$, then $(\iint\limits_{\mathbb{R}^2}|\eta(\gamma, (x, y))|^q \,dx \,dy)^{1/q} \le (\frac{1}{2})^\frac{1}{q}(\zeta(\frac{2}{pq})-1)(||\gamma||_{p, [0, 1]})^{\frac{2}{q}} $ for all $q \in [1, \frac{2}{p})$, where $\eta(\gamma, (x, y))$ is the winding number of $\gamma$ at $(x, y), \zeta$ is the Reimann zeta function, and $||\gamma||_{p, [0, 1]}$ is the $p$-variation of $\gamma$ on the interval $[0, 1]$. <br />Our main contribution is that we have explicitly given a bound by known constants, and we have found this by an elementary proof. We are going to be using a method introduced by L.C. Young in 1936.;math.CA
1801.00310;On Binary Distributed Hypothesis Testing;We consider the problem of distributed binary hypothesis testing of two sequences that are generated by an i.i.d. doubly-binary symmetric source. Each sequence is observed by a different terminal. The two hypotheses correspond to different levels of correlation between the two source components, i.e., the crossover probability between the two. The terminals communicate with a decision function via rate-limited noiseless links. We analyze the tradeoff between the exponential decay of the two error probabilities associated with the hypothesis test and the communication rates. We first consider the side-information setting where one encoder is allowed to send the full sequence. For this setting, previous work exploits the fact that a decoding error of the source does not necessarily lead to an erroneous decision upon the hypothesis. We provide improved achievability results by carrying out a tighter analysis of the effect of binning error, the results are also more complete as they cover the full exponent tradeoff and all possible correlations. We then turn to the setting of symmetric rates for which we utilize Korner-Marton coding to generalize the results, with little degradation with respect to the performance with a one-sided constraint (side-information setting).;cs.IT
1801.00311;Igor Rostislavovich Shafarevich: in Memoriam;The prominent Russian mathematician Igor Rostislavovich Shafarevich passed away on February 19, 2017. In this article we supply his biography, discuss his many important contributions to number theory, algebra and algebraic geometry, and also discuss his political activity and some of his numerous publications on social issues.;math.HO
1801.00312;Irreducible representations of the group of unipotent matrices of order $4$ over integers;We study a coarse moduli space of irreducible representations of the group of unipotent matrices of order $\mathbb{4}$ over the ring of integers which have finite weight. All such representations are known to be monomial. To describe a coarse moduli space of such representations, we need to study pairs of subgroups and their characters, which induce non-isomorphic irreducible representations. We obtain a full classification of such pairs and, respectively, a coarse moduli space.;math.RT
1801.00314;Symmetric double bubbles in the Grushin plane;We address the double bubble problem for the anisotropic Grushin perimeter $P_\alpha$, $\alpha\geq 0$, and the Lebesgue measure in $\mathbb R^2$, in the case of two equal volumes. We assume that the contact interface between the bubbles lays on either the vertical or the horizontal axis. Since no regularity theory is available in this setting, in both cases we first prove existence of minimizers via the direct method by symmetrization arguments and then characterize them in terms of the given area by first variation techniques. Angles at which minimal boundaries intersect satisfy the standard 120-degree rule up to a suitable change of coordinates. While for $\alpha=0$ the Grushin perimeter reduces to the Euclidean one and both minimizers coincide with the symmetric double bubble found in [Foisy et al., Pacific J. Math. (1993)], for $\alpha=1$ vertical interface minimizers have Grushin perimeter strictly greater than horizontal interface minimizers. As the latter ones are obtained by translating and dilating the Grushin isoperimetric set found in [Monti Morbidelli, J. Geom. Anal. (2004)], we conjecture that they solve the double bubble problem with no assumptions on the contact interface.;math.OC
1801.00320;Immersed M&#xf6,bius bands in knot complements and representatives of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-homology classes;We study the 3-dimensional immersed crosscap number of a knot, which is a nonorientable analogue of the immersed Seifert genus. We study knots with immersed crosscap number 1, and show that a knot has immersed crosscap number 1 if and only if it is a nonntrivial $(2p,q)$-torus or $(2p,q)$-cable knot. We show that unlike in the orientable case the immersed crosscap number can differ from the embedded crosscap number by arbitrarily large amounts, and that it is neither bounded below nor above by the 4-dimensional crosscap number. We then use these constructions to find, for any $n\geq 2$, an oriented 3-manifold $Y_n$ and class $\alpha_n \in H_2(Y_n,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ such that $\alpha_n$ can be represented by an immersed $\mathbb{RP}^2$, but any embedded representative of $\alpha_n$ has a component $S$ with $\chi(S) \leq 1-n$.;math.GT
1801.00321;Modified trace is a symmetrised integral;A modified trace for a finite k-linear pivotal category is a family of linear forms on endomorphism spaces of projective objects which has cyclicity and so-called partial trace properties. We show that a non-degenerate modified trace defines a compatible with duality Calabi-Yau structure on the subcategory of projective objects. The modified trace provides a meaningful generalisation of the categorical trace to non-semisimple categories and allows to construct interesting topological invariants. We prove, that for any finite-dimensional unimodular pivotal Hopf algebra over a field k, a modified trace is determined by a symmetric linear form on the Hopf algebra constructed from an integral. More precisely, we prove that shifting with the pivotal element defines an isomorphism between the space of right integrals, which is known to be 1-dimensional, and the space of modified traces. This result allows us to compute modified traces for all simply laced restricted quantum groups at roots of unity.;math.QA
1801.00323;Geometric optics for Rayleigh wavetrains in d-dimensional nonlinear elasticity;A Rayleigh wave is a type of surface wave that propagates in the boundary of an elastic solid with traction (or Neumann) boundary conditions. Since the 1980s much work has been done on the problem of constructing a leading term in an \emph{approximate} solution to the rather complicated second-order quasilinear hyperbolic boundary value problem with fully nonlinear Neumann boundary conditions that governs the propagation of Rayleigh waves. The question has remained open whether or not this leading term approximate solution is really close in a precise sense to the exact solution of the governing equations. We prove a positive answer to this question for the case of Rayleigh wavetrains in any space dimension $d\geq 2$. The case of Rayleigh pulses in dimension $d=2$ has already been treated by Coulombel and Williams. For highly oscillatory Rayleigh wavetrains we are able to construct high-order approximate solutions consisting of the leading term plus an arbitrary number of correctors. Using those high-order solutions we then perform an error analysis which shows (among other things) that for small wavelengths the leading term is close to the exact solution in $L^\infty$ on a fixed time interval independent of the wavelength. The error analysis is carried out in a somewhat general setting and is applicable to other types of waves for which high order approximate solutions can be constructed.;math.AP
1801.00324;Blockers for Triangulations of a Convex Polygon and a Geometric Maker-Breaker Game;Let $G$ be a complete convex geometric graph whose vertex set $P$ forms a convex polygon $C$, and let $F$ be a family of subgraphs of $G$. A blocker for $F$ is a set of edges, of smallest possible size, that contains a common edge with every element of $F$. Previous works determined the blockers for various families $F$ of non-crossing subgraphs, including the families of all perfect matchings, all spanning trees, all Hamiltonian paths, etc. <br />In this paper we present a complete characterization of the family $B$ of blockers for the family $T$ of triangulations of $C$. In particular, we show that $|B|=F_{2n-8}$, where $F_k$ is the $k$'th element in the Fibonacci sequence and $n=|P|$. <br />We use our characterization to obtain a tight result on a geometric Maker-Breaker game in which the board is the set of diagonals of a convex $n$-gon $C$ and Maker seeks to occupy a triangulation of $C$. Namely, we show that in the $(1:1)$ triangulation game, Maker can ensure a win within $n-3$ moves, and that in the $(1:2)$ triangulation game, Breaker can ensure a win within $n-3$ moves. In particular, the threshold bias for the game is $2$.;math.CO
1801.00325;Sharp finiteness principles for Lipschitz selections;Let $(M,\rho)$ be a metric space and let $Y$ be a Banach space. Given a positive integer $m$, let $F$ be a set-valued mapping from $M$ into the family of all compact convex subsets of $Y$ of dimension at most $m$. In this paper we prove a finiteness principle for the existence of a Lipschitz selection of $F$ with the sharp value of the finiteness constant.;math.FA
1801.00327;Construction of the quasi-potential for linear SDEs using false quasi-potentials and a geometric recursion;The quasi-potential is a key concept of the Large Deviation Theory for Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). Once the quasi-potential with respect to an attractor of the corresponding deterministic system is found, one can readily obtain maximum likelihood exit paths and estimate the exit rate from the basin of attraction and the invariant probability density near the attractor. The quasi-potential for a linear SDE with asymptotically stable equilibrium at the origin is a quadratic form whose matrix was found by Z. Chen and M. Freidlin (2005). Their formula involves an integral of certain matrix exponentials and is inconvenient for numerical evaluation. In this work, I propose a different approach for constructing the quasi-potential matrix for linear SDEs based on a certain easy-to-obtain hierarchy of orthogonal decompositions inspired by those used by M. Tao (2018). A number of properties of these decompositions, named false quasi-potential decompositions, is established. A geometric recursive algorithm implementing this approach is presented. It involves only numerically stable sub-algorithms such as the computation of Schur decompositions and solving systems of linear equations or quadratic least squares problems. This work is motivated by the need to initialize the quasi-potential solvers near asymptotically stable equilibria. An accurate way to do it is to linearize the SDE near the equilibrium and set the values of the quasi-potential at the neighboring mesh points to the exact quasi-potential of the linearized system.;math.PR
1801.00328;Reconstruction of the Path Graph;Let $P$ be a set of $n \geq 5$ points in convex position in the plane. The path graph $G(P)$ of $P$ is an abstract graph whose vertices are non-crossing spanning paths of $P$, such that two paths are adjacent if one can be obtained from the other by deleting an edge and adding another edge. <br />We prove that the automorphism group of $G(P)$ is isomorphic to $D_{n}$, the dihedral group of order $2n$. The heart of the proof is an algorithm that first identifies the vertices of $G(P)$ that correspond to boundary paths of $P$, where the identification is unique up to an automorphism of $K(P)$ as a geometric graph, and then identifies (uniquely) all edges of each path represented by a vertex of $G(P)$. The complexity of the algorithm is $O(N \log N)$ where $N$ is the number of vertices of $G(P)$.;math.CO
1801.00331;On Operator Valued Measures;We consider positive operator valued measures whose image is the bounded operators acting on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, and we relax, when possible, the usual assumption of positivity of the operator valued measure seen in the quantum information theory literature. We define the Radon-Nikodym derivative of a positive operator valued measure with respect to a complex measure induced by a given quantum state, this derivative does not always exist when the Hilbert space is infinite dimensional in so much as its range may include unbounded operators. We define integrability of a positive quantum random variable with respect to a positive operator valued measure. Emphasis is put on the structure of operator valued measures, and we develop positive operator valued versions of the Lebesque decomposition theorem and Johnson's atomic and nonatomic decomposition theorem. Beyond these generalizations, we make connections between absolute continuity and the "cleanness" relation defined on positive operator valued measures as well as to the notion of atomic and nonatomic measures.;math.FA
1801.00333;Quickest drift change detection in L&#xe9,vy-type force of mortality model;In this paper we give solution to the quickest drift change detection problem for a L\'evy process consisting of both a continuous Gaussian part and a jump component. We consider here Bayesian framework with an exponential a priori distribution of the change point using an optimality criterion based on a probability of false alarm and an expected delay of the detection. Our approach is based on the optimal stopping theory and solving some boundary value problem. Paper is supplemented by an extensive numerical analysis related with the construction of the Generalized Shiryaev-Roberts statistics. In particular, we apply this method (after appropriate calibration) to analyse Polish life tables and to model the force of mortality in this population with a drift changing in time.;math.OC
1801.00334;Newton-Okounkov polytopes of Bott-Samelson varieties as Minkowski sums;We compute the Newton--Okounkov bodies of line bundles on a Bott--Samelson resolution of the complete flag variety of $GL_n$ for a geometric valuation coming from a flag of translated Schubert subvarieties. The Bott--Samelson resolution corresponds to the decomposition $(s_1)(s_2s_1)(s_3s_2s_1)(\ldots)(s_{n-1}\ldots s_1)$ of the longest element in the Weyl group, and the Schubert subvarieties correspond to the terminal subwords in this decomposition. We prove that the resulting Newton--Okounkov polytopes for semiample line bundles satisfy the additivity property with respect to the Minkowski sum. In particular, they are Minkowski sums of Newton--Okounkov polytopes of line bundles on the complete flag varieties for $GL_2$,\ldots, $GL_{n}$.;math.AG
1801.00335;Plato&#x27,s cave and differential forms;In the 1970s and again in the 1990s, Gromov gave a number of theorems and conjectures motivated by the notion that the real homotopy theory of compact manifolds and simplicial complexes influences the geometry of maps between them. The main technical result of this paper supports this intuition: we show that maps of differential algebras are closely shadowed, in a technical sense, by maps between the corresponding spaces. As a concrete application, we prove the following conjecture of Gromov: if $X$ and $Y$ are finite complexes with $Y$ simply connected, then there are constants $C(X,Y)$ and $p(X,Y)$ such that any two homotopic $L$-Lipschitz maps have a $C(L+1)^p$-Lipschitz homotopy (and if one of the maps is a constant, $p$ can be taken to be $2$.) We hope that it will lead more generally to a better understanding of the space of maps from $X$ to $Y$ in this setting.;math.GT
1801.00339;A Harmonic Analysis Proof of the Boundary Observability Inequality for the Wave Equation and Visco-Elastic Equation;In this paper, we give a harmonic analysis proof of the Neumann boundary observability inequality for the wave equation in an arbitrary space dimension. Our proof is elementary in nature and gives a simple, explicit constant. We also extend the method to prove the observability inequality of a visco-elastic wave equation.;math.AP
1801.00341;Breaking the curse of dimension in multi-marginal Kantorovich optimal transport on finite state spaces;We present a new ansatz space for the general symmetric multi-marginal Kantorovich optimal transport problem on finite state spaces which reduces the number of unknowns from $\tbinom{N+\ell-1}{\ell-1}$ to $\ell\cdot(N+1)$, where $\ell$ is the number of marginal states and $N$ the number of marginals. <br />The new ansatz space is a careful low-dimensional enlargement of the Monge class, which corresponds to $\ell\cdot(N-1)$ unknowns, and cures the insufficiency of the Monge ansatz, i.e. we show that the Kantorovich problem always admits a minimizer in the enlarged class, for arbitrary cost functions. <br />Our results apply, in particular, to the discretization of multi-marginal optimal transport with Coulomb cost in three dimensions, which has received much recent interest due to its emergence as the strongly correlated limit of Hohenberg-Kohn density functional theory. In this context $N$ corresponds to the number of particles, motivating the interest in large $N$.;math.AP
1801.00343;Limit points of subsequences;Let $x$ be a sequence taking values in a separable metric space and $\mathcal{I}$ be a generalized density ideal or an $F_\sigma$-ideal on the positive integers (in particular, $\mathcal{I}$ can be any Erd{\H o}s--Ulam ideal or any summable ideal). It is shown that the collection of subsequences of $x$ which preserve the set of $\mathcal{I}$-cluster points of $x$ [respectively, $\mathcal{I}$-limit points] is of second category if and only if the set of $\mathcal{I}$-cluster points of $x$ [resp., $\mathcal{I}$-limit points] coincides with the set of ordinary limit points of $x$, moreover, in this case, it is comeager. In particular, it follows that the collection of subsequences of $x$ which preserve the set of ordinary limit points of $x$ is comeager.;math.GN
1801.00347;Extensions of submanifold theory to non-real settings, with applications;In this thesis, we study extensions of the theory of Riemannian submanifolds in two directions. First, we will show how Riemannian geometry and submanifold theory in particular, can be generalized using the notion of 'Rinehart spaces', and it will be demonstrated how the developed framework unifies some existing and new flavours of Riemannian geometry over different ground rings. In the second part of the thesis, we give a description of holomorphic Riemannian submanifold theory where complex numbers fully replace the role of the real numbers as ground field, and show how this can be applied to reveal direct connections between the submanifolds of so-called Wick-related pseudo-Riemannian spaces.;math.DG
1801.00348;Dynamical zeta functions for Axiom A flows;We show that the Ruelle zeta function of any smooth Axiom A flow with orientable stable/unstable spaces has a meromorphic continuation to the entire complex plane. The proof uses the meromorphic continuation result of [<a href="/abs/1410.5516">arXiv:1410.5516</a>] together with the work of Conley-Easton and [<a href="/abs/1711.10059">arXiv:1711.10059</a>] which imply that every basic hyperbolic set can be put into the framework of [<a href="/abs/1410.5516">arXiv:1410.5516</a>].;math.DS
1801.00351;Isoparametric functions on $\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{M}^m$;We classify the isoparametric functions on $\mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{M}^m$, $n, m\geq2$, with compact level sets, where $\mathbb{M}^m$ is a connected, closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $m$. Also, we classify the isoparametric hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{R}^2$ with constant principal curvatures.;math.DG
1801.00352;Coherence, squeezing and entanglement -- an example of peaceful coexistence;After exhaustive inspection of bosonic coherent states appearing in physical literature two of us, Horzela and Szafraniec, came in 2012 to the reasonably general definition which relies exclusively on reproducing kernels. The basic feature of coherent states, which is the resolution of the identity, is preserved though it now achieves advantageous form of the Segal-Bargmann transform. <br />It turns out that the aforesaid definition is not only extremely economical but also puts under a common umbrella typical coherent states as well as those which are squeezed and entangled. We examine the case here on the groundwork of holomorphic Hermite polynomials in one and two variables. An interesting side of this story is how some limit procedure allows disentangling.;math-ph
1801.00353;Generic pro-$p$ Hecke algebras;This is an extended and corrected version of the author's Diplomarbeit. A class of algebras called generic pro-$p$ Hecke algebras is introduced, enlarging the class of generic Hecke algebras by considering certain extensions of (extended) Coxeter groups. Examples of generic pro-$p$ Hecke algebras are given by pro-$p$-Iwahori Hecke algebras and Yokonuma-Hecke algebras. The notion of an orientation of a Coxeter group is introduced and used to define `Bernstein maps' intimately related to Bernstein's presentation and to Cherednik's cocycle. It is shown that certain relations in the Hecke algebra hold true, equivalent to Bernstein's relations in the case of Iwahori-Hecke algebras. <br />For a certain subclass called affine pro-$p$ Hecke algebras, containing Iwahori-Hecke and pro-$p$-Iwahori Hecke algebras, an explicit canonical and integral basis of the center is constructed and finiteness results are proved about the center and the module-structure of the algebra over its center, recovering results of Bernstein-Zelevinsky-Lusztig and Vign\'eras.;math.RT
1801.00355;Analytic computable structure theory and $L^p$-spaces part 2;Suppose $p \geq 1$ is a computable real. We extend previous work of Clanin, Stull, and McNicholl by classifying the computable $L^p$ spaces whose underlying measure spaces are atomic but not purely atomic. In addition, we determine the degrees of categoricity of these spaces and the complexity of associated projection maps.;math.LO
1801.00357;The global dimension of the algebra of the monoid of all partial functions on an $n$-set as the algebra of the EI-category of epimorphisms between subsets;We prove that the global dimension of the complex algebra of the monoid of all partial functions on an n-set is $n-1$ for all $n\geq 1$. This is also the global dimension of the complex algebra of the category of all epimorphisms between subsets of an $n$-set. In our proof we use standard homological methods as well as combinatorial techniques associated to the representation theory of the symmetric group. As part of the proof, we obtain a partial description of the Cartan matrix of these algebras.;math.RT
1801.00360;Geometric Perturbation Theory for a Class of Fiber Bundles;A systematic study of small, time-dependent, perturbations to geometric wave-equation domains is hardly existent. Acoustic enclosures are typical examples featuring locally reacting surfaces that respond to a pressure gradient or a pressure difference, alter the enclosure's volume and, hence, the boundary conditions, and do so locally through their vibrations. Accordingly, the Laplace-Beltrami operator in the acoustic wave equation lives in a temporally varying domain depending on the displacement of the locally reacting surface from equilibrium. The resulting partial differential equations feature nonlinearities and are coupled though the time-dependent boundary conditions. The solution to the afore-mentioned problem, as presented here, integrates techniques from differential geometry, functional analysis, and physics. The appropriate space is shown to be a (perturbation) fiber bundle. In the context of a systematic perturbation theory, the solution to the dynamical problem is obtained from a combination of semigroup techniques for operator evolution equations and metric perturbation theory as used in AdS/CFT. Duhamel's principle then yields a time-dependent perturbation theory, called geometric perturbation theory. It is analogous to, though different from, both Dirac's time-dependent perturbation theory and the Magnus expansion. Specifically, the formalism demonstrates that the stationary-domain approximation for vibrational acoustics only introduces a small error. Analytic simplifications methods are derived in the framework of the piston approximation. Globally reacting surfaces (so-called pistons) replace the formerly locally reacting surfaces and reduce the number of independent variables in the underlying partial differential equations. In this way, a straightforwardly applicable formalism is derived for scalar wave equations on time-varying domains.;math-ph
1801.00366;Szeg&#xf6, Limit Theorems for Singular Berezin-Toeplitz Operators;We consider Berezin-Toeplitz operators whose multipliers are compactly supported densities carried by a submanifold of ${\mathbb C}^N$ . We compute asymptotically the moments of their spectral measures, and we prove Szeg\"o limit theorems in cases when the submanifold is isotropic or co-isotropic, from which Weyl estimates follow. We also obtain asymptotics of the Schatten norms of such operators. Rescaled versions of these operators can be thought of as quantum mechanical mixed states, and our results give the semi-classical limit of their entropy.;math.SP
1801.00367;Examples of sharp asymptotic profiles of singular solutions to an elliptic equation with a sign-changing non-linearity;The first two authors [Proc. Lond. Math. Soc. (3) {\bf 114}(1):1--34, 2017] classified the behaviour near zero for all positive solutions of the perturbed elliptic equation with a critical Hardy--Sobolev growth <br />$$-\Delta u=|x|^{-s} u^{2^\star(s)-1} -\mu u^q \hbox{ in }B\setminus\{0\},$$ where $B$ denotes the open unit ball centred at $0$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n\geq 3$, $s\in (0,2)$, $2^\star(s):=2(n-s)/(n-2)$, $\mu&gt,0$ and $q&gt,1$. For $q\in (1,2^\star-1)$ with $2^\star=2n/(n-2)$, it was shown in the op. cit. that the positive solutions with a non-removable singularity at $0$ could exhibit up to three different singular profiles, although their existence was left open. In the present paper, we settle this question for all three singular profiles in the maximal possible range. As an important novelty for $\mu&gt,0$, we prove that for every $q\in (2^\star(s) -1,2^\star-1)$ there exist infinitely many positive solutions satisfying $|x|^{s/(q-2^\star(s)+1)}u(x)\to \mu^{-1/(q-2^\star(s)+1)}$ as $|x|\to 0$, using a dynamical system approach. Moreover, we show that there exists a positive singular solution with $\liminf_{|x|\to 0} |x|^{(n-2)/2} u(x)=0$ and <br />$\limsup_{|x|\to 0} |x|^{(n-2)/2} u(x)\in (0,\infty)$ if (and only if) $q\in (2^\star-2,2^\star-1)$.;math.AP
1801.00368;Stable rank one matrix completion is solved by two rounds of semidefinite programming relaxation;This paper studies the problem of deterministic rank-one matrix completion. It is known that the simplest semidefinite programming relaxation, involving minimization of the nuclear norm, does not in general return the solution for this problem. In this paper, we show that in every instance where the problem has a unique solution, one can provably recover the original matrix through two rounds of semidefinite programming relaxation with minimization of the trace norm. We further show that the solution of the proposed semidefinite program is Lipschitz-stable with respect to perturbations of the observed entries, unlike more basic algorithms such as nonlinear propagation or ridge regression. Our proof is based on recursively building a certificate of optimality corresponding to a dual sum-of-squares (SOS) polynomial. This SOS polynomial is built from the polynomial ideal generated by the completion constraints and the monomials provided by the minimization of the trace. The proposed relaxation fits in the framework of the Lasserre hierarchy, albeit with the key addition of the trace objective function. We further show how to represent and manipulate the moment tensor in favorable complexity by means of a hierarchical low-rank decomposition.;math.NA
1801.00370;Lie Pseudogroups &#xe0, la Cartan;We present a modern formulation of \'Elie Cartan's structure theory for Lie pseudogroups and prove a reduction theorem that clarifies the role of Cartan's systatic system. The paper is divided into three parts. In part one, using notions coming from the theory of Lie groupoids and algebroids, we introduce the framework of Cartan algebroids and realizations, structures that encode Cartan's structure equations and notion of a pseudogroup in normal form. In part two, we present a novel proof of Cartan's Second Fundamental Theorem, which states that any Lie pseudogroup is equivalent to a pseudogroup in normal form. In part three, we prove a new reduction theorem that states that, under suitable regularity conditions, a pseudogroup in normal form canonically reduces to a generalized pseudogroup of local solutions of a Lie-Pfaffian groupoid.;math.DG
1801.00375;Modular forms from Noether-Lefschetz theory;We enumerate smooth rational curves on very general Weierstrass fibrations over hypersurfaces in projective space. The generating functions for these numbers lie in the ring of classical modular forms. The method of proof uses topological intersection products on a period stack and the cohomological theta correspondence of Kudla and Millson for special cycles on a locally symmetric space of orthogonal type. The results here apply only in base degree 1, but heuristics for higher base degree match predictions from the topological string partition function.;math.AG
1801.00378;Tropical geometry of genus two curves;We exploit three classical characterizations of smooth genus two curves to study their tropical and analytic counterparts. First, we provide a combinatorial rule to determine the dual graph of each algebraic curve and the metric structure on the associated minimal Berkovich skeleton. Our main tool is the description of genus two curves via hyperelliptic covers of P^1 with six branch points. Given the valuations of these six points and their differences, our algorithm provides an explicit harmonic 2-to-1 map to a metric tree on six leaves. Second, we use tropical modifications to produce a faithful tropicalization in dimension three starting from a planar hyperelliptic embedding. <br />Finally, we consider the moduli space of abstract genus two tropical curves and translate the classical Igusa invariants characterizing isomorphism classes of genus two algebraic curves into the tropical realm. While these tropical Igusa functions do not yield coordinates in the tropical moduli space, we propose an alternative set of invariants that provides new length data.;math.AG
1801.00379;Word maps, word maps with constants and representation varieties of one-relator groups;We consider word maps and word maps with constants on a simple algebraic group. We present results on the images of such maps, in particular, we prove a theorem on the dominance of general word maps with constants, which can be viewed as an analogue of a well-known theorem of Borel on the dominance of genuine word maps. Besides, we establish a relationship between the existence of unipotents in the image of a word map and the structure of the corresponding representation variety.;math.GR
1801.00380;On Variable Ordination of Modified Cholesky Decomposition for Sparse Covariance Matrix Estimation;Estimation of large sparse covariance matrices is of great importance for statistical analysis, especially in the high-dimensional settings. The traditional approach such as the sample covariance matrix performs poorly due to the high dimensionality. The modified Cholesky decomposition (MCD) is a commonly used method for sparse covariance matrix estimation. However, the MCD method relies on the order of variables, which is often not available or cannot be pre-determined in practice. In this work, we solve this order issue by obtaining a set of covariance matrix estimates under different orders of variables used in the MCD. Then we consider an ensemble estimator as the "center" of such a set of covariance matrix estimates with respect to the Frobenius norm. The proposed method not only ensures the estimator to be positive definite, but also can capture the underlying sparse structure of the covariance matrix. Under some weak regularity conditions, we establish both algorithmic convergence and asymptotical convergence of the proposed method. The merits of the proposed method are illustrated through simulation studies and one real data example.;math.ST
1801.00381;Word maps on perfect algebraic groups;We extend Borel's theorem on the dominance of word maps from semisimple algebraic groups to some perfect groups. In another direction, we generalize Borel's theorem to some words with constants. We also consider the surjectivity problem for particular words and groups, give a brief survey of recent results, present some generalizations and variations and discuss various approaches, with emphasis on new ideas, constructions and connections.;math.GR
1801.00387;Diversity Analysis of Millimeter-Wave Massive MIMO Systems;This paper is concerned with asymptotic diversity analysis for millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive MIMO systems. First, for a single-user mmWave system employing distributed antenna subarray architecture in which the transmitter and receiver consist of Kt and Kr subarrays, respectively, a diversity gain theorem is established when the numbers of antennas at subarrays go to infinity. Specifically, assuming that all subchannels have the same number of propagation paths L, the theorem states that by employing such a distributed antenna-subarray architecture, a diversity gain of KrKtL-Ns+1 can be achieved, where Ns is the number of data streams. This result means that compared to the co-located antenna architecture, using the distributed antenna-subarray architecture can scale up the diversity gain or multiplexing gain proportionally to KrKt. The diversity gain analysis is then extended to the multiuser scenario as well as the scenario with conventional partially-connected RF structure in the literature. Simulation results obtained with the hybrid analog/digital processing corroborate the analysis results and show that the distributed subarray architecture indeed yields significantly better diversity performance than the co-located antenna architectures.;cs.IT
1801.00391;Rate of convergence in periodic homogenization of Hamilton-Jacobi equations: the convex setting;We study the rate of convergence of $u^\epsilon$, as $\epsilon \to 0+$, to $u$ in periodic homogenization of Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Here, $u^\epsilon$ and $u$ are viscosity solutions to the oscillatory Hamilton-Jacobi equation and its effective equation \begin{equation*} {\rm (C)_\epsilon} \qquad \begin{cases} u_t^\epsilon+H\left(\frac{x}{\epsilon},Du^\epsilon\right)=0 \qquad &amp,\text{in} \ \mathbb{R}^n \times (0,\infty), u^\epsilon(x,0)=g(x) \qquad &amp,\text{on} \ \mathbb{R}^n, \end{cases} \end{equation*} and \begin{equation*} {\rm (C)} \qquad \begin{cases} u_t+\overline{H}\left(Du\right)=0 \qquad &amp,\text{in} \ \mathbb{R}^n \times (0,\infty), u(x,0)=g(x) \qquad &amp,\text{on} \ \mathbb{R}^n, \end{cases} \end{equation*} respectively. We assume that the Hamiltonian $H=H(y,p)$ is coercive and convex in the $p$ variable and is $\mathbb{Z}^n$-periodic in the $y$ variable, and the initial data $g$ is bounded and Lipschitz continuous.;math.AP
1801.00392;Exponents of class groups of certain imaginary quadratic fields;Let $n&gt,1$ be an odd integer. We prove that there are infinitely many imaginary quadratic fields of the form $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{x^2-2y^n})$ whose ideal class group has an element of order $n$. This family gives a counter example to a conjecture by H. Wada \cite{WA70} on the structure of ideal class groups.;math.NT
1801.00394;Generalized Compression Strategy for the Downlink Cloud Radio Access Network;This paper studies the downlink of a cloud radio access network (C-RAN) in which a centralized processor (CP) communicates with mobile users through base stations (BSs) that are connected to the CP via finite-capacity fronthaul links. Information theoretically, the downlink of a C-RAN is modeled as a two-hop broadcast-relay network. Among the various transmission and relaying strategies for such model, this paper focuses on the compression strategy, in which the CP centrally encodes the signals to be broadcasted jointly by the BSs, then compresses and sends these signals to the BSs through the fronthaul links. This paper characterizes an achievable rate region for a generalized compression strategy with Marton's multicoding for broadcasting and multivariate compression for fronthaul transmission. We then compare this rate region with the distributed decode-forward (DDF) scheme, which achieves the capacity of the general relay networks to within a constant gap, and show that the difference lies in that DDF performs Marton's multicoding and multivariate compression jointly as opposed to successively as in the compression strategy. A main result of this paper is that under the assumption that the fronthaul links are subject to a \emph{sum} capacity constraint this difference is immaterial, so the successive encoding based compression strategy can already achieve the capacity region of the C-RAN to within a constant gap, where the gap is independent of the channel parameters and the power constraints at the BSs. For the special case of the Gaussian network, we further establish that under individual fronthaul constraints, the compression strategy achieves to within a constant gap to the \emph{sum} capacity of the C-RAN.;cs.IT
1801.00396;Towards multifractional calculus;After motivating the need of a multiscale version of fractional calculus in quantum gravity, we review current proposals and the program to be carried out in order to reach a viable definition of scale-dependent fractional operators. We present different types of multifractional Laplacians and comment on their known or expected properties.;math-ph
1801.00398;Scalable Hash-Based Estimation of Divergence Measures;We propose a scalable divergence estimation method based on hashing. Consider two continuous random variables $X$ and $Y$ whose densities have bounded support. We consider a particular locality sensitive random hashing, and consider the ratio of samples in each hash bin having non-zero numbers of Y samples. We prove that the weighted average of these ratios over all of the hash bins converges to f-divergences between the two samples sets. We show that the proposed estimator is optimal in terms of both MSE rate and computational complexity. We derive the MSE rates for two families of smooth functions, the H\"{o}lder smoothness class and differentiable functions. In particular, it is proved that if the density functions have bounded derivatives up to the order $d/2$, where $d$ is the dimension of samples, the optimal parametric MSE rate of $O(1/N)$ can be achieved. The computational complexity is shown to be $O(N)$, which is optimal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical divergence estimator that has optimal computational complexity and achieves the optimal parametric MSE estimation rate.;cs.IT
1801.00399;Computation of Maximal Determinants of Binary Circulant Matrices;We describe algorithms for computing maximal determinants of binary circulant matrices of small orders. Here "binary matrix" means a matrix whose elements are drawn from $\{0,1\}$ or $\{-1,1\}$. We describe efficient parallel algorithms for the search, using Duval's algorithm for generation of necklaces and the well-known representation of the determinant of a circulant in terms of roots of unity. Tables of maximal determinants are given for orders $\le 53$ (in the first case) or $\le 52$ (in the second case). Our computations extend earlier results and disprove two plausible conjectures.;math.CO
1801.00400;Value Functions and Optimality Conditions for Nonconvex Variational Problems with an Infinite Horizon in Banach Spaces;We investigate the value function of an infinite horizon variational problem in the infinite-dimensional setting. Firstly, we provide an upper estimate of its Dini--Hadamard subdifferential in terms of the Clarke subdifferential of the Lipschitz continuous integrand and the Clarke normal cone to the graph of the set-valued mapping describing dynamics. Secondly, we derive a necessary condition for optimality in the form of an adjoint inclusion that grasps a connection between the Euler--Lagrange condition and the maximum principle.;math.OC
1801.00403;Exact eigenfunction amplitude distributions of integrable quantum billiards;The exact probability distributions of the amplitudes of eigenfunctions, $\Psi(x, y)$, of several integrable planar billiards are analytically calculated and shown to possess singularities at $\Psi = 0$, the nature of this singularity is shape-dependent. In particular, we prove that the distribution function for a rectangular quantum billiard is proportional to the complete elliptic integral, ${\bf K}(1 - \Psi ^2)$, and demonstrate its universality, modulo a weak dependence on quantum numbers. On the other hand, we study the low-lying states of nonseparable, integrable triangular billiards and find the distributions thereof to be described by the Meijer G-function or certain hypergeometric functions. Our analysis captures a marked departure from the Gaussian distributions for chaotic billiards in its survey of the fluctuations of the eigenfunctions about $\Psi = 0$.;math-ph
1801.00406;Reduced Dimensional Optimal Vector Linear Index Codes for Index Coding Problems with Symmetric Neighboring and Consecutive Side-information;A single unicast index coding problem (SUICP) with symmetric neighboring and consecutive side-information (SNCS) has $K$ messages and $K$ receivers, the $k$th receiver $R_k$ wanting the $k$th message $x_k$ and having the side-information $\mathcal{K}_k=\{x_{k-U},\dots,x_{k-2},x_{k-1}\}\cup\{x_{k+1}, x_{k+2},\dots,x_{k+D}\}$. The single unicast index coding problem with symmetric neighboring and consecutive side-information, SUICP(SNCS), is motivated by topological interference management problems in wireless communication networks. Maleki, Cadambe and Jafar obtained the symmetric capacity of this SUICP(SNCS) and proposed optimal length codes by using Vandermonde matrices. In our earlier work, we gave optimal length $(U+1)$-dimensional vector linear index codes for SUICP(SNCS) satisfying some conditions on $K,D$ and $U$ \cite{VaR1}. In this paper, for SUICP(SNCS) with arbitrary $K,D$ and $U$, we construct optimal length $\frac{U+1}{\text{gcd}(K,D-U,U+1)}$-dimensional vector linear index codes. We prove that the constructed vector linear index code is of minimal dimension if $\text{gcd}(K-D+U,U+1)$ is equal to $\text{gcd}(K,D-U,U+1)$. The proposed construction gives optimal length scalar linear index codes for the SUICP(SNCS) if $(U+1)$ divides both $K$ and $D-U$. The proposed construction is independent of field size and works over every field. We give a low-complexity decoding for the SUICP(SNCS). By using the proposed decoding method, every receiver is able to decode its wanted message symbol by simply adding some index code symbols (broadcast symbols).;cs.IT
1801.00410;Enhanced ${q}$-Least Mean Square;In this work, a new class of stochastic gradient algorithm is developed based on $q$-calculus. Unlike the existing $q$-LMS algorithm, the proposed approach fully utilizes the concept of $q$-calculus by incorporating time-varying $q$ parameter. The proposed enhanced $q$-LMS ($Eq$-LMS) algorithm utilizes a novel, parameterless concept of error-correlation energy and normalization of signal to ensure high convergence, stability and low steady-state error. The proposed algorithm automatically adapts the learning rate with respect to the error. For the evaluation purpose the system identification problem is considered. Extensive experiments show better performance of the proposed $Eq$-LMS algorithm compared to the standard $q$-LMS approach.;math.OC
1801.00413;Hitting Time Quasi-metric and Its Forest Representation;Let $\hat m_{ij}$ be the hitting (mean first passage) time from state $i$ to state $j$ in an $n$-state ergodic homogeneous Markov chain with transition matrix $T$. Let $\Gamma$ be the weighted digraph whose vertex set coincides with the set of states of the Markov chain and arc weights are equal to the corresponding transition probabilities. It holds that $$ \hat m_{ij}= q_j^{-1}\cdot \begin{cases} f_{ij},&amp,\text{if }\,\, i\ne j,\\ q, &amp,\text{if }\,\, i=j, \end{cases} $$ where $f_{ij}$ is the total weight of 2-tree spanning converging forests in $\Gamma$ that have one tree containing $i$ and the other tree converging to $j$, $q_j$ is the total weight of spanning trees converging to $j$ in $\Gamma,$ and $q=\sum_{j=1}^nq_j$ is the total weight of all spanning trees in $\Gamma.$ Moreover, $f_{ij}$ and $q_j$ can be calculated by an algebraic recurrent procedure. A forest expression for Kemeny's constant is an immediate consequence of this result. Further, we discuss the properties of the hitting time quasi-metric $m$ on the set of vertices of $\Gamma$: $m(i,j)=\hat m_{ij}$, $i\neq j$, and $m(i,i)=0$. We also consider a number of other metric structures on the set of graph vertices related to the hitting time quasi-metric $m$---along with various connections between them. The notions and relationships under study are illustrated by two examples.;math.CO
1801.00416;Permutations with small maximal $k$-consecutive sums;Let $n$ and $k$ be positive integers with $n&gt,k$. Given a permutation $(\pi_1,\ldots,\pi_n)$ of integers $1,\ldots,n$, we consider $k$-consecutive sums of $\pi$, i.e., $s_i:=\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}\pi_{i+j}$ for $i=1,\ldots,n$, where we let $\pi_{n+j}=\pi_j$. What we want to do in this paper is to know the exact value of $$\mathrm{msum}(n,k):=\min\left\{\max\{s_i : i=1,\ldots,n\} -\frac{k(n+1)}{2}: \pi \in S_n\right\},$$ where $S_n$ denotes the set of all permutations of $1,\ldots,n$. In this paper, we determine the exact values of $\mathrm{msum}(n,k)$ for some particular cases of $n$ and $k$. As a corollary of the results, we obtain $\mathrm{msum}(n,3)$, $\mathrm{msum}(n,4)$ and $\mathrm{msum}(n,6)$ for any $n$.;math.CO
1801.00417;Construction of $J^{\text{th}}$-stage Nonuniform Wavelets on Local Fields;Shah and Abdullah [Complex Analysis Operator Theory, 9 (2015), 1589-1608] have introduced a generalized notion of nonuniform multiresolution analysis (NUMRA) on local field $K$ of positive characteristic in which the translation set $\Lambda$ acting on the scaling function to generate the core space $V_{0}$ is no longer a group, but is the union of ${\mathcal Z}$ and a translate of ${\mathcal Z}$, given by $\Lambda=\left\{0,u(r)/N \right\}+{\mathcal Z}$, where $N \ge 1$ is an integer and $r$ is an odd integer such that $r$ and $N$ are relatively prime, and ${\mathcal Z}=\{u(n): n\in\mathbb N_{0}\}$ is a complete list of distinct cosets of the unit disc $\mathfrak D$ in $K^+.$ In this paper, we focus on the extension of nonuniform continuous wavelets to the construction of $J^{\text{th}}$-stage nonuniform discrete wavelets on local fields. We establish some general characterizations for the $J^{\text{th}}$-stage nonuniform discrete wavelet systems to be orthornormal bases in $L^2(\Lambda)$. Moreover, we establish a relation between the continuous wavelets of $L^2(K)$ and their discrete counterparts of $l^2(\Lambda)$.;math.FA
1801.00419;A study concerning splitting and jointly continuous topologies on $C(Y,Z)$;Let $Y$ and $Z$ be two fixed topological spaces and $C(Y,Z)$ the set of all continuous maps from $Y$ into $Z$. We construct and study topologies on $C(Y,Z)$ that we call ${\cal F}_n(\tau_n)$-family-open topologies. Furthermore, we find necessary and sufficient conditions such that these topologies to be splitting and jointly continuous. Finally, we present questions concerning a further study on this area.;math.GN
1801.00420;Existence and uniqueness of solutions for a quasilinear KdV equation with degenerate dispersion;We consider a quasilinear KdV equation that admits compactly supported traveling wave solutions (compactons). This model is one of the most straightforward instances of degenerate dispersion, a phenomenon that appears in a variety of physical settings as diverse as sedimentation, magma dynamics and shallow water waves. We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions with sufficiently smooth, spatially localized initial data.;math.AP
1801.00421;Three-dimensional Ricci-degenerate Riemannian manifolds satisfying geometric equations;In this paper, we study a three-dimensional Ricci-degenerate Riemannian manifold $(M^3,g)$ that admits a smooth nonzero solution $f$ to the equation \begin{align} \label{a1a} <br />\nabla df=\psi Rc+\phi g, \end{align} where $\psi,\phi$ are given smooth functions of $f$, $Rc$ is the Ricci tensor of $g$. Spaces of this type include various interesting classes, namely gradient Ricci solitons, $m$-quasi Einstein metrics, (vacuum) static spaces, $V$-static spaces, and critical point metrics. <br />The $m$-quasi Einstein metrics and vacuum static spaces were previously studied in \cite{JJ,JEK}, respectively. In this paper, we refine them and develop a general approach for the solutions of (\ref{a1a}), we specify the shape of the metric $g$ satisfying (\ref{a1a}) when $\nabla f$ is not a Ricci-eigen vector. Then we focus on the remaining three classes, namely gradient Ricci solitons, $V$-static spaces, and critical point metrics. Furthermore, we present classifications of local three-dimensional Ricci-degenerate spaces of these three classes by explicitly describing the metric $g$ and the potential function $f$.;math.DG
1801.00422;Espaces de Banach-Colmez et faisceaux coh&#xe9,rents sur la courbe de Fargues-Fontaine;We give a new definition, simpler but equivalent, of the abelian category of Banach-Colmez spaces introduced by Colmez, and we explain the precise relationship with the category of coherent sheaves on the Fargues-Fontaine curve. One goes from one category to the other by changing the t-structure on the derived category. Along the way, we obtain a description of the pro-\'etale cohomology of the open disk and the affine space, of independent interest.;math.NT

We show that if the elementary theory of $\mathcal M$ is decidable then (1) the relation $Q( a) \rightleftharpoons$ "there is an infinite branch in the tree $Tr( a,x,y)$" is definable in $\mathcal M$, and (2) if there is an infinite branch in the tree $Tr( a,x,y)$, then there is a definable in $\mathcal M$ infinite branch.;math.LO
1801.00427;Fermat&#x27,s dilemma: Why did he keep mum on infinitesimals? and the European theological context;The first half of the 17th century was a time of intellectual ferment when wars of natural philosophy were echoes of religious wars, as we illustrate by a case study of an apparently innocuous mathematical technique called adequality pioneered by the honorable judge Pierre de Fermat, its relation to indivisibles, as well as to other hocus-pocus. Andre Weil noted that simple applications of adequality involving polynomials can be treated purely algebraically but more general problems like the cycloid curve cannot be so treated and involve additional tools--leading the mathematician Fermat potentially into troubled waters. Breger attacks Tannery for tampering with Fermat's manuscript but it is Breger who tampers with Fermat's procedure by moving all terms to the left-hand side so as to accord better with Breger's own interpretation emphasizing the double root idea. We provide modern proxies for Fermat's procedures in terms of relations of infinite proximity as well as the standard part function. <br />Keywords: adequality, atomism, cycloid, hylomorphism, indivisibles, infinitesimal, jesuat, jesuit, Edict of Nantes, Council of Trent 13.2;math.HO

This cohomology theory factors through the category of rigid analytic motives of Ayoub.;math.NT
1801.00431;Ultra-Reliable Cooperative Short-Packet Communications with Wireless Energy Transfer;We analyze a cooperative wireless communication system with finite block length and finite battery energy, under quasi-static Rayleigh fading. Source and relay nodes are powered by a wireless energy transfer (WET) process, while using the harvested energy to feed their circuits, send pilot signals to estimate channels at receivers, and for wireless information transmission (WIT). Other power consumption sources beyond data transmission power are considered. The error probability is investigated under perfect/imperfect channel state information (CSI), while reaching accurate closed-form approximations in ideal direct communication system setups. We consider ultra-reliable communication (URC) scenarios under discussion for the next fifth-generation (5G) of wireless systems. The numerical results show the existence of an optimum pilot transmit power for channel estimation, which increases with the harvested energy. We also show the importance of cooperation, even taking into account the multiplexing loss, in order to meet the error and latency constraints of the URC systems.;cs.IT
1801.00435;Analysis and Code Design for the Binary CEO Problem under Logarithmic Loss;In this paper, we propose an efficient coding scheme for the binary Chief Executive Officer (CEO) problem under logarithmic loss criterion. Courtade and Weissman obtained the exact rate-distortion bound for a two-link binary CEO problem under this criterion. We find the optimal test-channel model and its parameters for the encoder of each link by using the given bound. Furthermore, an efficient encoding scheme based on compound LDGM-LDPC codes is presented to achieve the theoretical rates. In the proposed encoding scheme, a binary quantizer using LDGM codes and a syndrome-decoding employing LDPC codes are applied. An iterative decoding is also presented as a fusion center to reconstruct the observation bits. The proposed decoder consists of a sum-product algorithm with a side information from other decoder and a soft estimator. The output of the CEO decoder is the probability of source bits conditional to the received sequences of both links. This method outperforms the majority-based estimation of the source bits utilized in the prior studies of the binary CEO problem. Our numerical examples verify a close performance of the proposed coding scheme to the theoretical bound in several cases.;cs.IT
1801.00438;On eigenfunctions and maximal cliques of Paley graphs of square order;In this paper we find new maximal cliques of size $\frac{q+1}{2}$ or $\frac{q+3}{2}$, accordingly as $q\equiv 1(4)$ or $q\equiv 3(4)$, in Paley graphs of order $q^2$, where $q$ is an odd prime power. After that we use new cliques to define a family of eigenfunctions corresponding to both non-principal eigenvalues and having the cardinality of support $q+1$, which is the minimum by the weight-distribution bound.;math.CO

Given positive integers $a,b,c,k$ and an odd prime number $p$ with $p\nmid c$, we employ the theory of ternary quadratic forms to determine completely when the mixed sum $ax^2+by^2+cP_{p^k+2}(z)$ represents all but finitely many positive integers.;math.NT
1801.00443;Capacity Characterization of UAV-Enabled Two-User Broadcast Channel;Although prior works have exploited the UAV's mobility to enhance the wireless communication performance under different setups, the fundamental capacity limits of UAV-enabled/aided multiuser communication systems have not yet been characterized. To fill this gap, we consider in this paper a UAV-enabled two-user broadcast channel (BC), where a UAV flying at a constant altitude is deployed to send independent information to two users at different fixed locations on the ground. We aim to characterize the capacity region of this new type of BC over a given UAV flight duration, by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and transmit power/rate allocations over time, subject to the UAV's maximum speed and maximum transmit power constraints. First, to draw essential insights, we consider two special cases with asymptotically large/low UAV flight duration/speed, respectively. For the former case, it is shown that a simple hover-fly-hover (HFH) UAV trajectory with time division multiple access (TDMA) based orthogonal multiuser transmission is capacity-achieving, while in the latter case, the UAV should hover at a fixed location that is nearer to the user with larger achievable rate and in general superposition coding (SC) based non-orthogonal transmission with interference cancellation at the receiver of the nearer user is required. Next, we consider the general case with finite UAV speed and flight duration. We show that the optimal UAV trajectory should follow a general HFH structure, i.e., the UAV successively hovers at a pair of initial and final locations above the line segment of the two users each with a certain amount of time and flies unidirectionally between them at the maximum speed, and SC is generally needed.;cs.IT
1801.00444;Common Throughput Maximization in UAV-Enabled OFDMA Systems with Delay Consideration;The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as communication platforms is of great practical significance in future wireless networks, especially for on-demand deployment in temporary events and emergency situations. Although prior works have shown the performance improvement by exploiting the UAV's mobility, they mainly focus on delay-tolerant applications. As delay requirements fundamentally limit the UAV's mobility, it remains unknown whether the UAV is able to provide any performance gain in delay-constrained communication scenarios. Motivated by this, we study in this paper a UAV-enabled orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) network where a UAV is dispatched as a mobile base station (BS) to serve a group of users on the ground. We consider a minimum-rate ratio (MRR) for each user, defined as the minimum instantaneous rate required over the average achievable throughput, to flexibly adjust the percentage of its delay-constrained data traffic. Under a given set of constraints on the users' MRRs, we aim to maximize the minimum average throughput of all users by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory and OFDMA resource allocation. First, we show that the max-min throughput in general decreases as the users' MRR constraints become more stringent, which reveals a fundamental throughput-delay tradeoff in UAV-enabled communications. Next, we propose an iterative parameter-assisted block coordinate descent method to optimize the UAV trajectory and OFDMA resource allocation alternately, by applying the successive convex optimization and the Lagrange duality, respectively. Furthermore, an efficient and systematic UAV trajectory initialization scheme is proposed based on a simple circular trajectory. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs.;cs.IT
1801.00450;An Efficient, Second Order Accurate, Universal Generalized Riemann Problem Solver Based on the HLLI Riemann Solver;The Riemann problem, and the associated generalized Riemann problem, are increasingly seen as the important building blocks for modern higher order Godunov-type schemes. In the past, building a generalized Riemann problem solver was seen as an intricately mathematical task for complicated physical or engineering problems because the associated Riemann problem is different for each hyperbolic system of interest. This paper changes that situation. <br />The HLLI Riemann solver is a recently-proposed Riemann solver that is universal in that it is applicable to any hyperbolic system, whether in conservation form or with non-conservative products. The HLLI Riemann solver is also complete in the sense that if it is given a complete set of eigenvectors, it represents all waves with minimal dissipation. It is, therefore, very attractive to build a generalized Riemann problem solver version of the HLLI Riemann solver. This is the task that is accomplished in the present paper. We show that at second order, the generalized Riemann problem version of the HLLI Riemann solver is easy to design. Our GRP solver is also complete and universal because it inherits those good properties from original HLLI Riemann solver. We also show how our GRP solver can be adapted to the solution of hyperbolic systems with stiff source terms. <br />Our generalized HLLI Riemann solver is easy to implement and performs robustly and well over a range of test problems. All implementation-related details are presented. Results from several stringent test problems are shown. These test problems are drawn from many different hyperbolic systems, and include hyperbolic systems in conservation form, with non-conservative products, and with stiff source terms. The present generalized Riemann problem solver performs well on all of them.;math.NA
1801.00457;Kinetic layers and coupling conditions for nonlinear scalar equations on networks;We consider a kinetic relaxation model and an associated macroscopic scalar nonlinear hyperbolic equation on a network. Coupling conditions for the macroscopic equations are derived from the kinetic coupling conditions via an asymptotic analysis near the nodes of the network. This analysis leads to the combination of kinetic half-space problems with Riemann problems at the junction. Detailed numerical comparisons between the different models show the agreement of the coupling conditions for the case of tripod networks.;math.AP
1801.00459;Geometry of complex bounded domains with finite-volume quotients;We first show that for a bounded pseudoconvex domain with a manifold quotient of finite-volume in the sense of Kahler-Einstein measure, the identity component of the automorphism group of this domain is semi-simple without compact factors. This partially answers an open question in [Fra95]. Then we apply this result in different settings to solve several open problems, for examples, <br />(1). We prove that the automorphism group of the Griffiths domain [Gri71] in $\mathbb{C}^2$ is discrete. This gives a complete answer to an open question raised four decades ago. <br />(2). We show that for a contractible HHR/USq complex manifold $D$ with a finite-volume manifold quotient $M$, if $D$ contains a one-parameter group of holomorphic automorphisms and the fundamental group of $M$ is irreducible, then $D$ is biholomorphic to a bounded symmetric domain. This theorem can be viewed as a finite-volume version of Nadel-Frankel's solution for the Kahzdan conjecture, which has been open for years. <br />(3). We show that for a bounded convex domain $D\subset \mathbb{C}^n$ of $C^2$-smooth boundary, if $D$ has a finite-volume manifold quotient with an irreducible fundamental group, then $D$ is biholomorphic to the unit ball in $\mathbb{C}^n$, which partially solves an old conjecture of Yau. <br />For (2) and (3) above, if the complex dimension is equal to $2$, more refined results will be provided.;math.DG
1801.00463;On spectra of quadratic operator pencils with rank one gyroscopic linear part;The spectrum of a selfadjoint quadratic operator pencil of the form $\lambda^2M-\lambda G-A$ is investigated where $M\geq 0$, $G\geq 0$ are bounded operators and $A$ is selfadjoint bounded below is investigated. It is shown that in the case of rank one operator $G$ the eigenvalues of such a pencil are of two types. The eigenvalues of one of these types are independent of the operator $G$. Location of the eigenvalues of both types is described. Examples for the case of the Sturm-Liouville operators $A$ are given.;math-ph

For $n=3$, we get a detailed description of such spaces. The euclidean 2-spheres were considered by W. P. Thurston: for $n=4$, the corresponding spaces provide the famous 7 examples of nonarithmetic compact holomorphic 2-ball quotients previously constructed by Deligne-Mostow.;math.GT

1801.00468;On Equitable Coloring Parameters of Certain Cycle Related Graphs;Coloring the vertices of a graph G subject to given conditions can be considered as a random experiment and corresponding to this experiment, a discrete random variable X can be defined as the colour of a vertex chosen at random, with respect to the given type of colouring of G and a probability mass function for this random variable can be defined accordingly. A proper coloring C of a graph G, which assigns colors to the vertices of G such that the numbers of vertices in any two colour classes differ by at most one, is called an equitable colouring of G. In this paper, we study two statistical parameters of certain cycle related graphs, with respect to their equitable colorings.;math.GM
1801.00474;Anti-Ramsey Multiplicities;The Ramsey multiplicity constant of a graph $H$ is the minimum proportion of copies of $H$ in the complete graph which are monochromatic under an edge-coloring of $K_n$ as $n$ goes to infinity. Graphs for which this minimum is asymptotically achieved by taking a random coloring are called {\em common}, and common graphs have been studied extensively, leading to the Burr-Rosta conjecture and Sidorenko's conjecture. Erd\H{o}s and S\'os asked what the maximum number of rainbow triangles is in a $3$-coloring of the edge set of $K_n$, a rainbow version of the Ramsey multiplicity question. A graph $H$ is called $r$-anti-common if the maximum proportion of rainbow copies of $H$ in any $r$-coloring of $E(K_n)$ is asymptotically achieved by taking a random coloring. In this paper, we investigate anti-Ramsey multiplicity for several families of graphs. We determine classes of graphs which are either anti-common or not. Some of these classes follow the same behavior as the monochromatic case, but some of them do not. In particular the rainbow equivalent of Sidorenko's conjecture, that all bipartite graphs are anti-common, is false.;math.CO
1801.00480;The Cyclic Douglas-Rachford Algorithm with r-sets-Douglas-Rachford Operators;The Douglas-Rachford (DR) algorithm is an iterative procedure that uses sequential reflections onto convex sets and which has become popular for convex feasibility problems.

We prove convergence and present numerical illustrations of the potential advantage of such operators with $r&gt,2$ over the classical $2$-sets-DR operators in a cyclic algorithm.;math.OC
1801.00485;Rigorous results for the distribution of money on connected graphs;This paper is concerned with general spatially explicit versions of three stochastic models for the dynamics of money that have been introduced and studied numerically by statistical physicists: the uniform reshuffling model, the immediate exchange model and the model with saving propensity. All three models consist of systems of economical agents that consecutively engage in pairwise monetary transactions. Computer simulations performed in the physics literature suggest that, when the number of agents and the average amount of money per agent are large, the distribution of money at equilibrium approaches the exponential distribution for the first model, the gamma distribution with shape parameter two for the second model and a gamma distribution whose shape parameter depends on the saving propensity for the third model. The main objective of this paper is to give rigorous proofs of and extend these conjectures to generalizations of the first two models and a variant of the third model that include local rather than global interactions, i.e., instead of choosing the two interacting agents uniformly at random from the system, the agents are located on the vertex set of a general connected graph and can only interact with their neighbors.;math.PR

We show that the Feynman propagator is an example of a reproducing kernel under a boundedness condition. To every Lagrangian thus corresponds a Hilbert space that does not need to be postulated \emph{a priori}. For the free non-relativistic particle, we justify mathematically the concept of space-time granularity. Reproducing kernels allow for a functional, rather than distributional, description of the Hilbert spaces of quantum theory, including the Fock space.;math-ph

We end with some remarks on binary tensors.;math.CO
1801.00501;Hereditary Semiorders and Enumeration of Semiorders by Dimension;In 2010, Bousquet-M\'elou et al. defined sequences of nonnegative integers called ascent sequences and showed that the ascent sequences of length $n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the interval orders, i.e., the posets not containing the poset $\mathbf{2}+\mathbf{2}$. Through the use of generating functions, this provided an answer to the longstanding open question of enumerating the (unlabeled) interval orders. A semiorder is an interval order having a representation in which all intervals have the same length. In terms of forbidden subposets, the semiorders exclude $\mathbf{2}+\mathbf{2}$ and $\mathbf{1}+\mathbf{3}$. The number of unlabeled semiorders on $n$ points has long been known to be the $n$-th Catalan number. However, describing the ascent sequences that correspond to the semiorders under the bijection of Bousquet-M\'elou et al. has proved difficult. In this paper, we discuss a major part of the difficulty in this area: the ascent sequence corresponding to a semiorder may have an initial subsequence that corresponds to an interval order that is not a semiorder. <br />We define the hereditary semiorders to be those corresponding to an ascent sequence for which every initial subsequence also corresponds to a semiorder. We provide a structural result that characterizes the hereditary semiorders and use this characterization to determine the ordinary generating function for hereditary semiorders. We also use our characterization of hereditary semiorders and the characterization of semiorders of dimension 3 given by Rabinovitch to provide a structural description of the semiorders of dimension at most 2. From this description, we are able to determine the ordinary generating for the semiorders of dimension at most 2.;math.CO
1801.00502;Structure of the flow and Yamada polynomials of cubic graphs;We establish a quadratic identity for the Yamada polynomial of ribbon cubic graphs in 3-space, extending the Tutte golden identity for planar cubic graphs. An application is given to the structure of the flow polynomial of cubic graphs at zero. The golden identity for the flow polynomial is conjectured to characterize planarity of cubic graphs, and we prove this conjecture for a certain infinite family of non-planar graphs. <br />Further, we establish exponential growth of the number of chromatic polynomials of planar triangulations, answering a question of D. Treumann and E. Zaslow. The structure underlying these results is the chromatic algebra, and more generally the SO(3) topological quantum field theory.;math.CO
1801.00503;Smooth solutions to the complex Plateau problem;Building on work of Du, Gao, and Yau, we give a characterization of smooth solutions, up to normalization, of the complex Plateau problem for strongly pseudoconvex Calabi--Yau CR manifolds of dimension $2n-1 \ge 5$ and in the hypersurface case when $n=2$. The latter case was completely solved by Yau for $n \ge 3$ but only partially solved by Du and Yau for $n=2$. As an application, we determine the existence of a link-theoretic invariant of normal isolated singularities that distinguishes smooth points from singular ones.;math.CV
1801.00505;Optimal Stochastic Management of Distributed Energy Storage Embedded with Wind Farms;Increasing wind turbines (WT) penetration and low carbon demand can potentially lead to two different flow peaks, generation and load, within distribution networks. This will not only constrain WT penetration but also pose serious threats to network reliability. This paper proposes energy storage (ES) to reduce system congestion cost caused by the two peaks by sending cost-reflective economic signals to affect ES operation in responding to network conditions. Firstly, a new charging and discharging (C/D) strategy based on Binary Search Method is designed for ES, which responds to system congestion cost over time. Then, a novel pricing method, based on Location Marginal Pricing, is designed for ES. The pricing model is derived by evaluating ES impact on the network power flows and congestion from the loss and congestion components in Location Marginal Pricing. The impact is then converted into an hourly economic signal to reflect ES operation. The proposed ES C/D strategy and pricing methods are validated on a real local Grid Supply Point area. Results show that the proposed Location Marginal Pricing-based pricing is efficient to capture the feature of ES and provide signals for affecting its operation. This work can further increase network flexibility and the capability of networks to accommodate increasing WT penetration.;math.OC

1801.00513;An elementary derivation of the Chinese restaurant process from Sethuraman&#x27,s stick-breaking process;The Chinese restaurant process (CRP) and the stick-breaking process are the two most commonly used representations of the Dirichlet process. However, the usual proof of the connection between them is indirect, relying on abstract properties of the Dirichlet process that are difficult for nonexperts to verify. This short note provides a direct proof that the stick-breaking process leads to the CRP, without using any measure theory. We also discuss how the stick-breaking representation arises naturally from the CRP.;math.ST

Girstmair proved local restrictions on $k$ depending on $q\pmod{12}$ and whether $q$ is a square and conjectured that these are the only restrictions possible. We verify the conjecture in the cases $q$ even, $q$ a square divisible by $3$ or $5$, and $2\le q\le 200$ (the latter by computer), and provide progress towards a general approach.;math.NT
1801.00518;Statistical and Computational Limits for Sparse Matrix Detection;This paper investigates the fundamental limits for detecting a high-dimensional sparse matrix contaminated by white Gaussian noise from both the statistical and computational perspectives. We consider $p\times p$ matrices whose rows and columns are individually $k$-sparse. We provide a tight characterization of the statistical and computational limits for sparse matrix detection, which precisely describe when achieving optimal detection is easy, hard, or impossible, respectively. Although the sparse matrices considered in this paper have no apparent submatrix structure and the corresponding estimation problem has no computational issue at all, the detection problem has a surprising computational barrier when the sparsity level $k$ exceeds the cubic root of the matrix size $p$: attaining the optimal detection boundary is computationally at least as hard as solving the planted clique problem. <br />The same statistical and computational limits also hold in the sparse covariance matrix model, where each variable is correlated with at most $k$ others. A key step in the construction of the statistically optimal test is a structural property for sparse matrices, which can be of independent interest.;math.ST
1801.00521;Asymptotic Gap Probability Distributions of the Gaussian Unitary Ensembles and Jacobi Unitary Ensembles;In this paper, we address a class of problems in unitary ensembles. Specifically, we study the probability that a gap symmetric about 0, i.e. $(-a,a)$ is found in the Gaussian unitary ensembles (GUE) and the Jacobi unitary ensembles (JUE) (where in the JUE, we take the parameters $\alpha=\beta$). By exploiting the even parity of the weight, a doubling of the interval to $(a^2,\infty)$ for the GUE, and $(a^2,1)$, for the (symmetric) JUE, shows that the gap probabilities maybe determined as the product of the smallest eigenvalue distributions of the LUE with parameter $\alpha=-1/2,$ and $\alpha=1/2$ and the (shifted) JUE with weights $x^{1/2}(1-x)^{\beta}$ and $x^{-1/2}(1-x)^{\beta}$ The $\sigma$ function, namely, the derivative of the log of the smallest eigenvalue distributions of the finite-$n$ LUE or the JUE, satisfies the Jimbo-Miwa-Okamoto $\sigma$ form of $P_{V}$ and $P_{VI}$, although in the shift Jacobi case, with the weight $x^{\alpha}(1-x)^{\beta},$ the $\beta$ parameter does not show up in the equation. We also obtain the asymptotic expansions for the smallest eigenvalue distributions of the Laguerre unitary and Jacobi unitary ensembles after appropriate double scalings, and obtained the constants in the asymptotic expansion of the gap probablities, expressed in term of the Barnes $G-$ function valuated at special point.;math-ph
1801.00523;Interval estimators for ratios of independent quantiles and interquantile ranges;Recent research has shown that interval estimators with good coverage properties are achievable for some functions of quantiles, even when sample sizes are not large. Motivated by this, we consider interval estimators for the ratios of independent quantiles and interquantile ranges that will be useful when comparing location and scale for two samples. Simulations show that the intervals have excellent coverage properties for a wide range of distributions, including those that are heavily skewed. Examples are also considered that highlight the usefulness of using these approaches to compare location and scale.;math.ST

1801.00539;A local systolic-diastolic inequality in contact and symplectic geometry;Let $\Sigma$ be a connected closed three-manifold, and let $t_\Sigma$ be the order of the torsion subgroup of $H_1(\Sigma,\mathbb Z)$. For a contact form $\alpha$ on $\Sigma$, we denote by $\mathrm{Volume}(\alpha)$ the contact volume of $\alpha$, and by $T_{\min}(\alpha)$ and $T_{\max}(\alpha)$ the minimal period and the maximal period of prime periodic orbits of the Reeb flow of $\alpha$ respectively. We say that $\alpha$ is Zoll if its Reeb flow generates a free $S^1$-action on $\Sigma$. We prove that every Zoll contact form $\alpha_*$ on $\Sigma$ admits a $C^3$-neighbourhood $\mathcal U$ in the space of contact forms such that \[ t_\Sigma T_{\min}(\alpha)^2\leq \mathrm{Volume}(\alpha)\leq t_\Sigma T_{\max}(\alpha)^2,\qquad \forall\,\alpha\in\mathcal U, \] and any of the equalities holds if and only if $\alpha$ is Zoll. <br />We extend the above picture to odd-symplectic forms $\Omega$ on $\Sigma$ of arbitrary odd dimension. We define the volume of $\Omega$, which generalises both the contact volume and the Calabi invariant of Hamiltonian functions, and the action of closed characteristics of $\Omega$, which generalises both the period of periodic Reeb orbits and the action of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. We say that $\Omega$ is Zoll if its characteristics are the orbits of a free $S^1$-action on $\Sigma$. We prove that the volume and the action of a Zoll odd-symplectic form satisfy a certain polynomial equation. This builds the equality case of a conjectural local systolic-diastolic inequality for odd-symplectic forms, which we establish in some cases. This inequality recovers the inequality between the minimal action and the Calabi invariant of Hamiltonian isotopies $C^1$-close to the identity on a closed symplectic manifold, as well as the local contact systolic-diastolic inequality above. <br />Finally, applications to magnetic geodesics are discussed.;math.SG
1801.00542;Normal approximations for discrete-time occupancy processes;We study normal approximations for a class of discrete-time occupancy processes, namely, Markov chains with transition kernels of product Bernoulli form. This class encompasses numerous models which appear in the complex networks literature, including stochastic patch occupancy models in ecology, network models in epidemiology, and a variety of dynamic random graph models. Bounds on the rate of convergence for a central limit theorem are obtained using Stein's method and moment inequalities on the deviation from an analogous deterministic model. As a consequence, our work also implies a uniform law of large numbers for a subclass of these processes.;math.PR
1801.00550;Radiality of definable sets;In this article we use techniques developed by Hrushovski-Loeser to study certain metric properties of the Berkovich analytification of a finite morphism of smooth connected projective curves. In recent work, M. Temkin proved a radiality statement for the topological ramification locus associated to such finite morphisms. We generalize this result in two directions. We prove a radiality statement for a more general class of sets which we call definable sets. In another direction, we show that the result of Temkin can be obtained in families.;math.AG
1801.00552;Performance Limits with Additive Error Metrics in Noisy Multi-Measurement Vector Problem;Real-world applications such as magnetic resonance imaging with multiple coils, multi-user communication, and diffuse optical tomography often assume a linear model where several sparse signals sharing common sparse supports are acquired by several measurement matrices and then contaminated by noise. Multi-measurement vector (MMV) problems consider the estimation or reconstruction of such signals. In different applications, the estimation error that we want to minimize could be the mean squared error or other metrics such as the mean absolute error and the support set error. Seeing that minimizing different error metrics is useful in MMV problems, we study information-theoretic performance limits for MMV signal estimation with arbitrary additive error metrics. We also propose a message passing algorithmic framework that achieves the optimal performance, and rigorously prove the optimality of our algorithm for a special case. We further conjecture the optimality of our algorithm for some general cases, and back it up through numerical examples. As an application of our MMV algorithm, we propose a novel setup for active user detection in multi-user communication and demonstrate the promise of our proposed setup.;cs.IT
1801.00556;Uniqueness of solutions for Keller-Segel system of porous medium type coupled to fluid equations;We prove the uniqueness of H\"older continuous weak solutions via duality argument and vanishing viscosity method for the Keller-Segel system of porous medium type equations coupled to the Stokes system in dimensions three. An important step is the estimate of the Green function of parabolic equations with lower order terms of variable coefficients, which seems to be of independent interest.;math.AP
1801.00561;A modified subgradient extragradient method for solving the variational inequality problem;The subgradient extragradient method for solving the variational inequality (VI) problem, which is introduced by Censor et al. \cite{CGR}, replaces the second projection onto the feasible set of the VI, in the extragradient method, with a subgradient projection onto some constructible half-space. Since the method has been introduced, many authors proposed extensions and modifications with applications to various problems. <br />In this paper, we introduce a modified subgradient extragradient method by improving the stepsize of its second step. Convergence of the proposed method is proved under standard and mild conditions and primary numerical experiments illustrate the performance and advantage of this new subgradient extragradient variant.;math.OC
1801.00563;Block Diagonalization Type Precoding Algorithms for IEEE 802.11ac Systems;Block diagonalization (BD) based precoding schemes are well-known linear transmit strategies employed in the downlink of multi-user multiple-input multipleoutput (MU-MIMO) systems. BD type precoding algorithms employed at the transmit side effect the suppression of multi-user interference (MUI) by the decomposition of MU-MIMO broadcast channel into multiple single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO) channels followed by parallelization of the SU-MIMO channels to obtain independent streams of each user. Given that the design of linear precoding algorithms has made significant progress, the implementation of these techniques in standards for wireless local area networks (WLAN) remains an open question. In this work, schemes for implementation of BD based precoding techniques in the framework of IEEE 802.11ac standard are proposed followed by performance evaluation of these techniques in the proposed framework. I analyze the sum-rate and the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the techniques in my framework and obtain computational complexity-wise as well as performance-wise optimal algorithm for my system.;cs.IT
1801.00564;Convergence analysis of the Chebyshev-Legendre spectral method for a class of Fredholm fractional integro-differential equations;In this paper, we propose and analyze a spectral Chebyshev-Legendre approximation for fractional order integro-differential equations of Fredholm type. The fractional derivative is described in the Caputo sense. Our proposed method is illustrated by considering some examples whose exact solutions are available. We prove that the error of the approximate solution decay exponentially in L^2-norm.;math.NA
1801.00570;Periodic solutions for neutral evolution equations with delays;The aim is to study the periodic solution problem for neutral evolution equation <br />$$(u(t)-G(t,u(t-\xi)))'+Au(t)=F(t,u(t),u(t-\tau)),\ \ \ \ t\in\R$$in Banach space $X$, where $A:D(A)\subset X\rightarrow X$ is a closed linear operator, and $-A$ generates a compact analytic operator semigroup $T(t)(t\geq0)$. <br />With the aid of the analytic operator semigroup theories and some fixed point theorems, we obtain the existence and uniqueness of periodic mild solution for neutral evolution equations. The regularity of periodic mild solution for evolution equation with delay is studied, and some the existence results of the classical and strong solutions are obtained. In the end, we give an example to illustrate the applicability of abstract results. Our works greatly improve and generalize the relevant results of existing literatures.;math.FA
1801.00572;Tail empirical process and weighted extreme value index estimator for randomly right-censored data;A tail empirical process for heavy-tailed and right-censored data is introduced and its Gaussian approximation is established. In this context, a (weighted) new Hill-type estimator for positive extreme value index is proposed and its consistency and asymptotic normality are proved by means of the aforementioned process in the framework of second-order conditions of regular variation. In a comparative simulation study, the newly defined estimator is seen to perform better than the already existing ones in terms of both bias and mean squared error. As a real data example, we apply our estimation procedure to evaluate the tail index of the survival time of Australian male Aids patients. It is noteworthy that our approach may also serve to develop other statistics related to the distribution tail such as second-order parameter and reduced-bias tail index estimators. Furthermore, the proposed tail empirical process provides a goodness-of-fit test for Pareto-like models under censorship.;math.ST
1801.00573;Positive periodic solutions for abstract evolution equations with delay;In this paper, we discuss the existence and asymptotic stability of the positive periodic mild solutions for the abstract evolution equation with delay in an ordered Banach space $E$, $$u'(t)+Au(t)=F(t,u(t),u(t-\tau)),\ \ \ \ t\in\R,$$ where $A:D(A)\subset E\rightarrow E$ is a closed linear operator and $-A$ generates a positive $C_{0}$-semigroup $T(t)(t\geq0)$, $F:\R\times E\times E\rightarrow E$ is a continuous mapping which is $\omega$-periodic in $t$. <br />Under order conditions on the nonlinearity $F$ concerning the growth exponent of the semigroup $T(t)(t\geq0)$ or the first eigenvalue of the operator $A$, we obtain the existence and asymptotic stability results of the positive $\omega$-periodic mild solutions by applying operator semigroup theory. In the end, an example is given to illustrate the applicability of our abstract results.;math.FA
1801.00574;Monotone iterative technique for delayed evolution equation periodic problems in Banach spaces;In this paper, we deal with the existence of $\omega$-periodic mild solutions for the abstract evolution equation with delay in an ordered Banach space $E$ $$u'(t)+Au(t)=F(t,u(t),u(t-\tau)),\ \ \ \ t\in\R,$$ where $A:D(A)\subset E\rightarrow E$ is a closed linear operator and $-A$ generates a positive $C_{0}$-semigroup $T(t)(t\geq0)$, $F:\R\times E\times E\rightarrow E$ is a continuous mapping which is $\omega$-periodic in $t$, and $\tau\geq0$ is a constant. Under some weaker assumptions, we construct monotone iterative method for the delayed evolution equation periodic problems, and obtain the existence of maximal and minimal periodic mild solutions. <br />The results obtained generalize the recent conclusions on this topic. Finally, we present two applications to illustrate the feasibility of our abstract results.;math.FA
1801.00575;Existence and Asymptotic Stability of Periodic Solutions for Impulsive Delay Evolution Equations;In this paper, we are devoted to consider the periodic problem for the impulsive evolution equations with delay in Banach space. By using operator semigroups theory and fixed point theorem, we establish some new existence theorems of periodic mild solutions for the equations. In addition, with the aid of an integral inequality with impulsive and delay, we present essential conditions on the nonlinear and impulse functions to guarantee that the equations have an asymptotically stable $\omega$-periodic mild solution.;math.FA
1801.00576;Definably simple stable groups with finitary groups of automorphisms;We prove that infinite definably simple locally finite groups of finite centraliser dimension are simple groups of Lie type over locally finite fields. Then, we identify conditions on automorphisms of a stable group that make it resemble the Frobenius maps, and allow us to classify definably simple stable groups in the specific case when they admit such automorphisms.;math.LO
1801.00577;The variational discretization of the constrained higher-order Lagrange-Poincar&#xe9, equations;In this paper we investigate a variational discretization for the class of mechanical systems in presence of symmetries described by the action of a Lie group which reduces the phase space to a (non-trivial) principal bundle. By introducing a discrete connection we are able to obtain the discrete constrained higher-order Lagrange-Poincar\'e equations. These equations describe the dynamics of a constrained Lagrangian system when the Lagrangian function and the constraints depend on higher-order derivatives such as the acceleration, jerk or jounces. The equations, under some mild regularity conditions, determine a well defined (local) flow which can be used to define a numerical scheme to integrate the constrained higher-order Lagrange-Poincar\'e equations. <br />Optimal control problems for underactuated mechanical systems can be viewed as higher-order constrained variational problems. We study how a variational discretization can be used in the construction of variational integrators for optimal control of underactuated mechanical systems where control inputs act soley on the base manifold of a principal bundle (the shape space). Examples include the energy minimum control of an electron in a magnetic field and two coupled rigid bodies attached at a common center of mass.;math.DS
1801.00578;Non-conforming harmonic virtual element method: $h$- and $p$-versions;We study the $h$- and $p$-versions of non-conforming harmonic virtual element methods (VEM) for the approximation of the Dirichlet-Laplace problem on a 2D polygonal domain, providing quasi-optimal error bounds. Harmonic VEM do not make use of internal degrees of freedom. This leads to a faster convergence, in terms of the number of degrees of freedom, as compared to standard VEM. Importantly, the technical tools used in our $p$-analysis can be employed as well in the analysis of more general non-conforming finite element methods and VEM. The theoretical results are validated in a series of numerical experiments. The $hp$-version of the method is numerically tested, demonstrating exponential convergence with rate given by the square root of the number of degrees of freedom.;math.NA
1801.00580;A formula for the action of Dehn twists on HOMFLY-PT skein modules and its applications;We introduce a formula for the action of Dehn twists on the HOMFLY-PT type skein module of a surface. As an application of the formula to mapping class group, we give an embedding from the Torelli group of a surface $\Sigma_{g,1}$ of genus $g$ with non-empty connected boundary into the completed HOMFLY-PT type skein algebra. As an application of the formula to integral homology $3$-spheres, we construct an invariant $z(M) \in \mathbb{Q} [\rho ] [[h]]$ for an integral homology $3$-sphere $M$. The invariant $z(M) \mod (h^{n+1})$ is a finite type invariant of order $n$.;math.GT
1801.00581;The space of probabilistic 1-lipschitz maps;We introduce and study a natural notion of probabilistic 1-Lipschitz maps. We prove that the space of all probabilistic 1-Lipschitz maps defined on a probabilistic metric space G is also a probabilistic metric space. Moreover, when G is a group, then the space of all prob-abilistic 1-Lipschitz maps defined on G can be endowed with a monoid structure. Then, we caracterize the probabilistic invariant complete Menger groups by the space of all probabilistic 1-Lipschitz maps in the sprit of the classical Banach-Stone theorem.;math.FA
1801.00582;Rankin-Cohen deformations of the algebra of Jacobi forms;The aim of this work is to emphasize the arithmetical and algebraic aspects of the Rankin-Cohen brackets in order to extend them to several natural number-theoretical situations. We build an analytically consistent derivation on the algebra $\widetilde{\mathcal{J}}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$ of weak Jacobi forms. From this derivation, we obtain a sequence of bilinear forms on $\widetilde{\mathcal{J}}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$ that is a formal deformation and whose restriction to the algebra $\mathcal{M}_*$ of modular forms is an analogue of Rankin-Cohen brackets associated to the Serre derivative. Using a classification of all admissible Poisson brackets, we generalize this construction to build a family of Rankin-Cohen deformations of $\widetilde{\mathcal{J}}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$. The algebra $\widetilde{\mathcal{J}}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$ is a polynomial algebra in four generators. We consider some localization $\mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$ of $\widetilde{\mathcal{J}}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$ with respect to one of the generators. We construct Rankin-Cohen deformations on $\mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$. We study their restriction to $\widetilde{\mathcal{J}}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$ and to some subalgebra of $\mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{ev},*}$ naturally isomorphic to the algebra of quasimodular forms.;math.NT
1801.00583;An approximation scheme for semilinear parabolic PDEs with convex and coercive Hamiltonians;We propose an approximation scheme for a class of semilinear parabolic equations that are convex and coercive in their gradients. Such equations arise often in pricing and portfolio management in incomplete markets and, more broadly, are directly connected to the representation of solutions to backward stochastic differential equations. The proposed scheme is based on splitting the equation in two parts, the first corresponding to a linear parabolic equation and the second to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The solutions of these two equations are approximated using, respectively, the Feynman-Kac and the Hopf-Lax formulae. We establish the convergence of the scheme and determine the convergence rate, combining Krylov's shaking coefficients technique and Barles-Jakobsen's optimal switching approximation.;math.OC
1801.00591;Unions of Orthogonal Arrays and their aberrations via Hilbert bases;We generate all the Orthogonal Arrays (OAs) of a given size n and strength t as the union of a collection of OAs which belong to an inclusion-minimal set of OAs. We derive a formula for computing the (Generalized) Word Length Pattern of a union of OAs that makes use of their polynomial counting functions. In this way the best OAs according to the Generalized Minimum Aberration criterion can be found by simply exploring a relatively small set of counting functions. The classes of OAs with 5 binary factors, strength 2, and sizes 16 and 20 are fully described.;math.ST
1801.00606;Secrecy Capacity-Memory Tradeoff of Erasure Broadcast Channels;This paper derives upper and lower bounds on the secrecy capacity-memory tradeoff of a wiretap erasure broadcast channel (BC) with Kw weak receivers and Ks strong receivers, where weak receivers, respectively strong receivers, have same erasure probabilities and cache sizes. The lower bounds are achieved by schemes that meticulously combine joint cache-channel coding with wiretap coding and key-aided one-time pads. The presented upper bound holds more generally for arbitrary degraded BCs and arbitrary cache sizes. When only weak receivers have cache memories, upper and lower bounds coincide for small and large cache memories, thus providing the exact secrecy capacity-memory tradeoff for this setup. The derived bounds allow to further conclude that the secrecy capacity is positive even when the eavesdropper is stronger than all the legitimate receivers with cache memories. Moreover, they show that the secrecy capacity-memory tradeoff can be significantly smaller than its non-secure counterpart, but it grows much faster when cache memories are small. The paper also presents a lower bound on the global secrecy capacity-memory tradeoff where one is allowed to optimize the cache assignment subject to a total cache budget. It is close to the best known lower bound without secrecy constraint. For small total cache budget, the global secrecy capacity-memory tradeoff is achieved by assigning all the available cache memory uniformly over all receivers if the eavesdropper is stronger than all legitimate receivers, and it is achieved by assigning the cache memory uniformly only over the weak receivers if the eavesdropper is weaker than the strong receivers.;cs.IT
1801.00608;On the growth of Lebesgue constants for convex polyhedra;In the paper, new estimates of the Lebesgue constant $$ \mathcal{L}(W)=\frac1{(2\pi)^d}\int_{\mathbb{T}^d}\bigg|\sum_{{k}\in W\cap \mathbb{Z}^d} e^{i({k},\,{x})}\bigg| {\rm d}{ x} $$ for convex polyhedra $W\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ are obtained. The main result states that if $W$ is a convex polyhedron such that $[0,m_1]\times\dots\times [0,m_d]\subset W\subset [0,n_1]\times\dots\times [0,n_d]$, then $$ c(d)\prod_{j=1}^d \log(m_j+1)\le \mathcal{L}(W)\le C(d)s\prod_{j=1}^d \log(n_j+1), $$ where $s$ is a size of the triangulation of $W$.;math.CA
1801.00613;Equivalence between radial solutions of different parabolic gradient-diffusion equations and applications;We consider a general form of a parabolic equation that generalizes both the standard parabolic $p$-Laplace equation and the normalized version that has been proposed in stochastic game theory. We establish an equivalence between this equation and the standard $p$-parabolic equation posed in a fictitious space dimension, valid for radially symmetric solutions. This allows us to find suitable explicit solutions for example of Barenblatt type, and as a consequence we settle the exact asymptotic behaviour of the Cauchy problem even for nonradial data. We also establish the asymptotic behaviour in a bounded domain. Moreover, we use the explicit solutions to establish the parabolic Harnack's inequality.;math.AP
1801.00614;On Bennequin type inequalities for links in tight contact 3-manifolds;We prove that a version of the Thurston-Bennequin inequality holds for Legendrian and transverse links in a rational homology contact 3-sphere $(M,\xi)$, whenever $\xi$ is tight. More specifically, we show that the self-linking number of a transverse link $T$ in $(M,\xi)$, such that the boundary of its tubular neighbourhood consists of incompressible tori, is bounded by the Thurston norm $||T||_T$ of $T$. A similar inequality is given for Legendrian links by using the notions of positive and negative transverse push-off. We apply this bound to compute the tau-invariant for every strongly quasi-positive link in $S^3$. This is done by proving that our inequality is sharp for this family of smooth links. Moreover, we use a stronger Bennequin inequality, for links in the tight 3-sphere, to generalize this result to quasi-positive links and determine their maximal self-linking number.;math.GT
1801.00615;Computational multiscale methods for linear heterogeneous poroelasticity;We consider a strongly heterogeneous medium saturated by an incompressible viscous fluid as it appears in geomechanical modeling. This poroelasticity problem suffers from rapidly oscillating material parameters, which calls for a thorough numerical treatment. In this paper, we propose a method based on the local orthogonal decomposition technique and motivated by a similar approach used for linear thermoelasticity. Therein, local corrector problems are constructed in line with the static equations, whereas we propose to consider the full system. This allows to benefit from the given saddle point structure and results in two decoupled corrector problems for the displacement and the pressure. We prove the optimal first-order convergence of this method and verify the result by numerical experiments.;math.NA
1801.00616;Mixed-Radix Nim;We present take-away games whose Sprague-Grundy functions are given by the Nim sum of heap sizes in a mixed base $\beta$. Let $\Delta_\beta$ be the set of such games. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a minimum of $\Delta_\beta$, and a recursive construction of the maximum of $\Delta_\beta$.;math.CO
1801.00617;Variety of idempotents in nonassociative algebras;In this paper, we study the variety of all nonassociative (NA) algebras from the idempotent point of view. We are interested, in particular, in the spectral properties of idempotents when algebra is generic, i.e. idempotents are in general position. Our main result states that in this case, there exist at least $n-1$ nontrivial obstructions (syzygies) on the Peirce spectrum of a generic NA algebra of dimension $n$. We also discuss the exceptionality of the eigenvalue $\lambda=\frac12$ which appears in the spectrum of idempotents in many classical examples of NA algebras and characterize its extremal properties in metrised algebras.;math.RA
1801.00618;Input to State Stability of Bipedal Walking Robots: Application to DURUS;Bipedal robots are a prime example of systems which exhibit highly nonlinear dynamics, underactuation, and undergo complex dissipative impacts. This paper discusses methods used to overcome a wide variety of uncertainties, with the end result being stable bipedal walking. The principal contribution of this paper is to establish sufficiency conditions for yielding input to state stable (ISS) hybrid periodic orbits, i.e., stable walking gaits under model-based and phase-based uncertainties. In particular, it will be shown formally that exponential input to state stabilization (e-ISS) of the continuous dynamics, and hybrid invariance conditions are enough to realize stable walking in the 23-DOF bipedal robot DURUS. This main result will be supported through successful and sustained walking of the bipedal robot DURUS in a laboratory environment.;math.OC
1801.00621;FKG (and other inequalities) via (generalized) FK representation (and iterated folding);In this paper we prove several inequalities by means of diagrammatic expansions, a technique already used in [BG13]. This time we show that iterations of the folding of a probability leads to the proof of some in- equalities by means of a generalized random cluster representation of the iterated foldings. One of the inequalities is the well known FKG inequal- ity, which ends up being proven, quite unexpectedly, by means of the (generalized) FK representation. Although most of the results are not new, we hope that the techniques will find applications in other contexts.;math.PR
1801.00623;Observability of Boolean Networks via Set Controllability Approach;The controllability and observability of Boolean control network(BCN) are two fundamental properties. But the verification of latter is much harder than the former. This paper considers the observability of BCN via controllability. First, the set controllability is proposed, and the necessary and sufficient condition is obtained. Then a technique is developed to convert the observability into an equivalent set controllability problem. Using the result for set controllability, the necessary and sufficient condition is also obtained for the observability of BCN.;math.OC
1801.00624;Homology of Lie Algebras of Orthogonal and Symplectic Generalized Jacobi Matrices;In this note, we compute the homology with trivial coefficients of Lie algebras of generalized Jacobi matrices of type $B, C$ and $D$ over an associative unital $k$-algebra with $k$ being a field of characteristic $0$.;math.RT
1801.00627;Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse games on a class of scattered linear orders;Two structures $A$ and $B$ are $n$-equivalent if player II has a winning strategy in the $n$-move Ehrenfeucht-Fra\"iss\'e game on $A$ and $B$. In earlier papers we studied $n$-equivalence classes of ordinals and coloured ordinals. In this paper we similarly treat a class of scattered order-types, focussing on monomials and sums of monomials in $\omega$ and its reverse $\omega^*$.;math.LO
1801.00628;Deformation of the $&#x3c3,_2$-curvature;Our main goal in this work is to deal with results concern to the $\sigma_2$-curvature. First we find a symmetric 2-tensor canonically associated to the $\sigma_2$-curvature and we present an Almost Schur Type Lemma. Using this tensor we introduce the notion of $\sigma_2$-singular space and under a certain hypothesis we prove a rigidity result. Also we deal with the relations between flat metrics and $\sigma_2$-curvature. With a suitable condition on the $\sigma_2$-curvature we show that a metric has to be flat if it is close to a flat metric. We conclude this paper by proving that the 3-dimensional torus does not admit a metric with constant scalar curvature and non-negative $\sigma_2$-curvature unless it is flat.;math.DG
1801.00629;$H^2$--Convergence of least-squares kernel collocation methods;The strong-form asymmetric kernel-based collocation method, commonly referred to as the Kansa method, is easy to implement and hence is widely used for solving engineering problems and partial differential equations despite the lack of theoretical support. The simple least-squares (LS) formulation, on the other hand, makes the study of its solvability and convergence rather nontrivial. In this paper, we focus on general second order linear elliptic differential equations in $\Omega \subset R^d$ under Dirichlet boundary conditions. With kernels that reproduce $H^m(\Omega)$ and some smoothness assumptions on the solution, we provide denseness conditions for a constrained least-squares method and a class of weighted least-squares algorithms to be convergent. Theoretically, we identify some $H^2(\Omega)$ convergent LS formulations that have an optimal error behavior like $h^{m-2}$. We also demonstrate the effects of various collocation settings on the respective convergence rates, as well as how these formulations perform with high order kernels and when coupled with the stable evaluation technique for the Gaussian kernel.;math.NA
1801.00630;A nonstandard invariant of coarse spaces;We construct a set-valued invariant $\iota\left(X,\xi\right)$ of pointed coarse spaces $\left(X,\xi\right)$ by using nonstandard analysis. The invariance under coarse equivalence is established. A sufficient condition for the invariant to be of cardinality $\leq1$ is provided. Miller et al. and subsequent researchers have introduced a similar but standard set-valued coarse invariant $\sigma\left(X,\xi\right)$ of pointed metric spaces $\left(X,\xi\right)$. In order to compare these two invariants, we construct a natural transformation $\omega_{\left(X,\xi\right)}$ from $\sigma\left(X,\xi\right)$ to $\iota\left(X,\xi\right)$. The surjectivity of $\omega_{\left(X,\xi\right)}$ is proved for all proper geodesic spaces $\left(X,\xi\right)$.;math.GN
1801.00633;On semilinear elliptic equations with diffuse measures;We consider semilinear equation of the form $-Lu=f(x,u)+\mu$, where $L$ is the operator corresponding to a transient symmetric regular Dirichlet form ${\mathcal E}$, $\mu$ is a diffuse measure with respect to the capacity associated with ${\mathcal E}$, and the lower-order perturbing term $f(x,u)$ satisfies the sign condition in $u$ and some weak integrability condition (no growth condition on $f(x,u)$ as a function of $u$ is imposed). We prove the existence of a solution under mild additional assumptions on ${\mathcal E}$. We also show that the solution is unique if $f$ is nonincreasing in $u$.;math.AP
1801.00638;Distinguishing pure representations by normalized traces;Given two pure representations of the absolute Galois group of an $\ell$-adic number field with coefficients in $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_p$ (with $\ell\neq p$), we show that the Frobenius-semisimplifications of the associated Weil--Deligne representations are twists of each other by an integral power of certain unramified character if they have equal normalized traces. This is an analogue of a recent result of Patankar and Rajan in the context of local Galois representations.;math.NT
1801.00647;Distributed Control and Stabilization for Discrete-time Large Scale Systems With Imposed Constraints;This paper is concerned with the distributed control and stabilization problems for linear discrete-time large scale systems with imposed constraints. The main contributions of this paper are: Firstly, by using the maximum principle (necessary condition) for the finite horizon optimal control developed in this paper, the optimal distributed controller is thus derived, which can be easily calculated, Secondly, by defining the Lyapunov function with the optimal cost function, we show that the systems with imposed constraints can be stabilized by the optimal distributed controller for the infinite horizon case. The main techniques adopted in this paper are the maximum principle and the solution to the forward and backward difference equations (FBDE), which are the basis in solving distributed control and stabilization problems for linear systems with constraints.;math.OC
1801.00653;Rings which are Essential over their Centers, II;A ring $R$ with center $C$ is said to be\textit{centrally essential} if the module $R_C$ is an essential extension of the module $C_C$. We describe centrally essential exterior algebras of finitely generated free modules over not necessary commutative rings and study properties of semi-Artinian centrally essential rings.

1801.00654;Simple supermodules over Lie superalgebras;We show that, for many Lie superalgebras admitting a compatible $\mathbb{Z}$-grading, Kac induction functor gives rise to a bijection between simple supermodules over a Lie superalgebra and simple supermodules over the even part of this Lie superalgebra. This reduces the classification problem for the former to the one for the latter. Our result applies to all classical Lie superalgebra of type $I$, in particular, to the general linear Lie superalgebra $\gl(m|n)$. In the latter case we also show that the rough structure of simple $\gl(m|n)$-supermodules and also that of Kac supermodules depends only on the annihilator of the $\mf{gl}(m)\oplus \mf{gl}(n)$-input and hence can be computed using the combinatorics of BGG category $\mathcal{O}$.;math.RT
1801.00655;Contractibility of the Space of Opers for Classical Groups;The geometric Langlands program is an exciting direction of research, although a lot of progress has been made there are still open questions and gaps. One of the necessary steps for this program is the proof of the existence and the cohomological triviality (more precisely, the O- contractibility) of the space of rational opers. In this paper, we prove the homotopical contractibility of the space of rational opers for classical groups.;math.RT
1801.00656;On the constant scalar curvature K&#xe4,hler metrics, existence results;In this paper, we generalize our apriori estimates on cscK(constant scalar curvature K\"ahler) metric equation to more general scalar curvature type equations (e.g., twisted cscK metric equation). As applications, under the assumption that the automorphism group is discrete, we prove the celebrated Donaldson's conjecture that the non-existence of cscK metric is equivalent to the existence of a destabilized geodesic ray where the $K$-energy is non-increasing. Moreover, we prove that the properness of $K$-energy in terms of $L^1$ geodesic distance $d_1$ in the space of K\"ahler potentials implies the existence of cscK metric. Finally, we prove that weak minimizers of the $K$-energy in $(\mathcal{E}^1, d_1)$ are smooth.;math.DG
1801.00657;The $p$-adic Lambert $W$ function;In this paper we introduce the $p$-adic analogue of the Lambert $W$ function, and study its main properties.;math.CA
1801.00661;Heat kernels of non-symmetric jump processes with exponentially decaying jumping kernel;In this paper we study the transition densities for a large class of non-symmetric Markov processes whose jumping kernels decay exponentially or subexponentially. We obtain their upper bounds which also decay at the same rate as their jumping kernels. When the lower bounds of jumping kernels satisfy the weak upper scaling condition at zero, we also establish lower bounds for the transition densities, which are sharp.;math.PR
1801.00663;A Sharp Estimate for Probability Distributions;We consider absolutely continuous probability distributions $f(x)dx$ on $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$. A result of Feldheim and Feldheim shows, among other things, that if the distribution is not compactly supported, then there exist $z &gt, 0$ such that most events in $\left\{X + Y \geq 2z\right\}$ are comprised of a 'small' term satisfying $\min(X,Y) \leq z$ and a 'large' term satisfying $\max(X,Y) \geq z$ (as opposed to two 'large' terms that are both larger than $z$) $$ \limsup_{z \rightarrow \infty}~ \mathbb{P}\left( \min(X,Y) \leq z | X+Y \geq 2z\right) = 1.$$ The result fails if the distribution is compactly supported. We prove $$\sup_{z &gt, 0 } ~\mathbb{P}\left( \min(X,Y) \leq z | X+Y \geq 2z\right) \geq \frac{1}{24 + 8\log_2{( med(X) \|f\|_{L^{\infty}})}},$$ where $med(X)$ denotes the median. Interestingly, the logarithm is necessary and the result is sharp up to constants, we also discuss some open problems.;math.PR
1801.00670;Low-Rank Matrix Approximations Do Not Need a Singular Value Gap;This is a systematic investigation into the sensitivity of low-rank approximations of real matrices. We show that the low-rank approximation errors, in the two-norm, Frobenius norm and more generally, any Schatten p-norm, are insensitive to additive rank-preserving perturbations in the projector basis, and to matrix perturbations that are additive or change the number of columns (including multiplicative perturbations). Thus, low-rank matrix approximations are always well-posed and do not require a singular value gap. In the presence of a singular value gap, connections are established between low-rank approximations and subspace angles.;math.NA
1801.00673;CutIGA with Basis Function Removal;We consider a cut isogeometric method, where the boundary of the domain is allowed to cut through the background mesh in an arbitrary fashion for a second order elliptic model problem. In order to stabilize the method on the cut boundary we remove basis functions which have small intersection with the computational domain. We determine criteria on the intersection which guarantee that the order of convergence in the energy norm is not affected by the removal. The higher order regularity of the B-spline basis functions leads to improved bounds compared to standard Lagrange elements.;math.NA
1801.00682;A Probabilistic Subspace Bound with Application to Active Subspaces;Given a real symmetric positive semi-definite matrix E, and an approximation S that is a sum of n independent matrix-valued random variables, we present bounds on the relative error in S due to randomization. The bounds do not depend on the matrix dimensions but only on the numerical rank (intrinsic dimension) of E. Our approach resembles the low-rank approximation of kernel matrices from random features, but our accuracy measures are more stringent. <br />In the context of parameter selection based on active subspaces, where S is computed via Monte Carlo sampling, we present a bound on the number of samples so that with high probability the angle between the dominant subspaces of E and S is less than a user-specified tolerance. This is a substantial improvement over existing work, as it is a non-asymptotic and fully explicit bound on the sampling amount n, and it allows the user to tune the success probability. It also suggests that Monte Carlo sampling can be efficient in the presence of many parameters, as long as the underlying function f is sufficiently smooth.;math.NA
1801.00683;The sequential loss of allelic diversity;This paper gives a new flavor of what Peter Jagers and his co-authors call `the path to extinction'. In a neutral population with constant size $N$, we assume that each individual at time $0$ carries a distinct type, or allele. We consider the joint dynamics of these $N$ alleles, for example the dynamics of their respective frequencies and more plainly the nonincreasing process counting the number of alleles remaining by time $t$. We call this process the extinction process. We show that in the Moran model, the extinction process is distributed as the process counting (in backward time) the number of common ancestors to the whole population, also known as the block counting process of the $N$-Kingman coalescent. Stimulated by this result, we investigate: (1) whether it extends to an identity between the frequencies of blocks in the Kingman coalescent and the frequencies of alleles in the extinction process, both evaluated at jump times, (2) whether it extends to the general case of $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot processes.;math.PR
1801.00684;Risk minimization in life-cycle oil production optimization;The geology of oil reservoirs is largely unknown. Consequently, the reservoir models used for production optimization are subject to significant uncertainty. To minimize the associated risk, the oil literature has mainly used ensemble-based methods to optimize sample estimated risk measures of net present value (NPV). However, the success in reducing risk critically depends on the choice of risk measure. As a systematic approach to risk mitigation in production optimization, this paper characterizes proper risk measures by the axioms of coherence and aversion. As an example of a proper measure, we consider conditional value-at-risk, $\text{CVaR}_{\alpha}$, at different risk levels, $\alpha$. The potential of $\text{CVaR}_{\alpha}$ to minimize profit loss is demonstrated by a simulated case study. The case study compares $\text{CVaR}_{\alpha}$ to real-world best practices, represented by reactive control. It shows that for any risk level, $\alpha$, we may find an optimized strategy that provides lower risk than reactive control. However, despite overall lower risk, we see that all optimized strategies still yield some unacceptable low profit realizations relative to reactive control. To remedy this, we introduce a risk mitigation method based on the NPV offset distribution. Unlike existing methods of the oil literature, the offset risk mitigation approach minimizes the risk relative to a reference strategy representing common real-life practices, e.g. reactive control. In the simulated case study, we minimize the worst case profit offset to reduce the risk of realizations that do worse than the reactive strategy. The results suggest that it may be more relevant to consider the NPV offset distribution than the NPV distribution when minimizing risk in production optimization.;math.OC
1801.00691;Energy-enstrophy conserving compatible finite element schemes for the rotating shallow water equations with slip boundary conditions;We describe an energy-enstrophy conserving discretisation for the rotating shallow water equations with slip boundary conditions. This relaxes the assumption of boundary-free domains (periodic solutions or the surface of a sphere, for example) in the energy-enstrophy conserving formulation of McRae and Cotter (2014). This discretisation requires extra prognostic vorticity variables on the boundary in addition to the prognostic velocity and layer depth variables. The energy-enstrophy conservation properties hold for any appropriate set of compatible finite element spaces defined on arbitrary meshes with arbitrary boundaries. We demonstrate the conservation properties of the scheme with numerical solutions on a rotating hemisphere.;math.NA
1801.00696;On pairs of interacting electrons in a quantum wire;In this paper we consider pairs of interacting electrons moving in a simple quantum wire, namely the half-line. In particular, we extend the results obtained in [<a href="/abs/1708.03753">arXiv:1708.03753</a>] by allowing for contact interactions of the Lieb-Liniger type between the two electrons constituting the pair. We construct the associated Hamiltonian rigorously and study its spectral properties. We then investigate Bose-Einstein condensation of pairs and prove, as a main result, the existence of condensation whenever the Hamiltonian has a non-trivial discrete spectrum. Most importantly, condensation is proved for very weak and very strong contact interactions.;math-ph
1801.00699;Sandwich classification for $O_{2n+1}(R)$ and $U_{2n+1}(R,&#x394,)$ revisited;In a recent paper, the author proved that if $n\geq 3$ is a natural number, $R$ a commutative ring and $\sigma\in GL_n(R)$, then $t_{kl}(\sigma_{ij})$ where $i\neq j$ and $k\neq l$ can be expressed as a product of $8$ matrices of the form $^{\epsilon}\sigma^{\pm 1}$ where $\epsilon\in E_n(R)$. In this article we prove similar results for the odd-dimensional orthogonal groups $O_{2n+1}(R)$ and the odd-dimensional unitary groups $U_{2n+1}(R,\Delta)$ under the assumption that $R$ is commutative and $n\geq 3$. This yields new, short proofs of the Sandwich Classification Theorems for the groups $O_{2n+1}(R)$ and $U_{2n+1}(R,\Delta)$.;math.KT
1801.00700;Nests, and their Role in the Orderability Problem;This chapter is divided into two parts. The first part is a survey of some recent results on nests and the orderability problem. The second part consists of results, partial results and open questions, all viewed in the light of nests. From connected LOTS, to products of LOTS and function spaces, up to an order relation in the Fermat Real Line.;math.GN
1801.00706;A new representation of Hankel operators and its spectral consequences;We describe a new representation of Hankel operators $H$ as pseudo-differential operators $A$ in the space of functions defined on the whole axis. The amplitudes of such operators $A$ have a very special structure: they are products of functions of a one variable only. This representation has numerous spectral consequences both for compact Hankel operators and for operators with the continuous spectrum.;math.SP
1801.00709;Cluster algebras arising from cluster tubes I: integer vectors;We study cluster algebras arising from cluster tubes. We obtain categorical interpretations for $g$-vectors, $c$-vectors and denominator vectors for cluster algebras of type $\mathrm{C}$ with respect to arbitrary initial seeds. In particular, a denominator theorem has been proved, which enables us to establish the linearly independence of denominator vectors of cluster variables from the same cluster for cluster algebras of type $\mathrm{A}\mathrm{B}\mathrm{C}$. This strengthens the link between cluster tubes and cluster algebras of type $\mathrm{C}$ initiated by Buan, Marsh and Vatne.;math.RA
1801.00714;Exact Exponent for Soft Covering;This work establishes the exact exponents for the soft-covering phenomenon of a memoryless channel under the total variation metric when random (i.i.d. and constant-composition) channel codes are used. The exponents, established herein, are strict improvements in both directions on bounds found in the literature. This complements the recent literature establishing the exact exponents under the relative entropy metric, however, the proof techniques have significant differences, and thus, neither result trivially implies the other. <br />The found exponents imply new and improved bounds for various problems that use soft-covering as their achievability argument, including new lower bounds for the resolvability exponent and the secrecy exponent in the wiretap channel.;cs.IT
1801.00721;A crossing lemma for multigraphs;Let $G$ be a drawing of a graph with $n$ vertices and $e&gt,4n$ edges, in which no two adjacent edges cross and any pair of independent edges cross at most once. According to the celebrated Crossing Lemma of Ajtai, Chv\'atal, Newborn, Szemer\'edi and Leighton, the number of crossings in $G$ is at least $c{e^3\over n^2}$, for a suitable constant $c&gt,0$. In a seminal paper, Sz\'ekely generalized this result to multigraphs, establishing the lower bound $c{e^3\over mn^2}$, where $m$ denotes the maximum multiplicity of an edge in $G$. We get rid of the dependence on $m$ by showing that, as in the original Crossing Lemma, the number of crossings is at least $c'{e^3\over n^2}$ for some $c'&gt,0$, provided that the "lens" enclosed by every pair of parallel edges in $G$ contains at least one vertex. This settles a conjecture of Kaufmann.;math.CO
1801.00722;Bases for Kumjian-Pask algebras over standard $k$-graphs;For any Kumjian-Pask algebra $KP_R(\Lambda)$ defined over a $k$-graph $\Lambda$ of a special kind (a "standard $k$-graph"), we obtain an $R$-basis.;math.KT
1801.00724;Subdifferential formulae for the supremum of an arbitrary family of functions;This work provides calculus for the Fr\'echet and limiting subdifferential of the pointwise supremum given by an arbitrary family of lower semicontinuous functions. We start our study showing fuzzy results about the Fr\'echet subdifferential of the supremum function. Posteriorly, we study in finite- and infinite-dimensional settings the limiting subdifferential of the supremum function. Finally, we apply our results to the study of the convex subdifferential, here we recover general formulae for the subdifferential of an arbitrary family of convex functions.;math.OC
1801.00726;Forcing Brushes;We give short and simple proofs of the inequalities $B(G)\leq Z(L(G))$ and $Z(G)\leq Z(L(G))$ first established by Erzurumluo\u{g}lu, Meagher, and Pike, where $G$ is a graph without isolated vertices, $B(G)$ is the brushing number of $G$, $Z(G)$ is the zero forcing number of $G$, and $L(G)$ is the line graph of $G$.;math.CO
1801.00728;Integration of quadratic Lie algebroids to Riemannian Cartan-Lie groupoids;Cartan-Lie algebroids, i.e. Lie algebroids equipped with a compatible connection, permit the definition of an adjoint representation, on the fiber as well as on the tangent of the base. We call (positive) quadratic Lie algebroids, Cartan-Lie algebroids with ad-invariant (Riemannian) metrics on their fibers and base $\kappa$ and $g$, respectively. We determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for a positive quadratic Lie algebroid to integrate to a Riemmanian Cartan-Lie groupoid. Here we mean a Cartan-Lie groupoid $\mathcal{G}$ equipped with a bi-invariant and inversion invariant metric $\eta$ on $T\mathcal{G}$ such that it induces by submersion the metric $g$ on its base and its restriction to the $t$-fibers coincides with $\kappa$.;math.DG
1801.00733;The bicanonical map of the Cartwright-Steger surface;We prove that the bicanonical map of the Cartwright-Steger surface is an embedding. We also discuss two minimal surfaces of general type, both covered by the Cartwright-Steger surface. One has $K^2=2$, $p_g=1$, $\pi_1=\{1\}$ and the other has $K^2=1$, $p_g=0$, $\pi_1=\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$.;math.AG
1801.00735;Filtered finiteness of the image of the unstable Hurewicz homomorphism with applications to bordism of immersions;After recent work of Hill, Hopkins, and Ravenel on the Kervaire invariant one problem, as well as Adams' solution of the Hopf invariant one problem, an immediate consequence of Curtis conjecture is that the set of spherical classes in $H_*Q_0S^0$ is finite. Similarly, Eccles conjecture, when specialised to $X=S^n$ with $n&gt,0$, together with Adams' Hopf invariant one theorem, implies that the set of spherical classes in $H_*QS^n$ is finite. We prove a filtered version of the above the finiteness properties. We show that if $X$ is an arbitrary $CW$-complex such that $H_*X$ is finite dimensional then the image of the composition ${_2\pi_*}\Omega^l\Sigma^{l+2}X\to{_2\pi_*}Q\Sigma^2X\to H_*Q\Sigma^2X$ is finite, the finiteness remains valid if we formally replace $X$ with $S^{-1}$. As an immediate and interesting application, we observe that for any compact Lie group $G$ with $\dim\mathfrak{g}&gt,1$ and for any $n&gt,0$ the image of the composition ${_2\pi_*}Q\Sigma^{\dim\mathfrak{g}}BG_+^{[n]}\to{_2\pi_*}Q\Sigma^{\dim\mathfrak{g}}BG_+\to {_2\pi_*}Q_0S^0\to H_*Q_0S^0$ is finite where $\Sigma^{\dim\mathfrak{g}}BG_+\to S^0$ is a suitably twisted transfer map. Next, we consider work of Koschorke and Sanderson which using Thom-Pontrjagin construction provides a $1$-$1$ correspondence (a group isomorphism if $m+d&gt,0$) $\Phi^{N,\xi}_{m,d}: \mathrm{Imm}_\xi^d(\mathbb{R}^m\times N) \longrightarrow [N_+,\Omega^{m+d}\Sigma^dT(\xi)]$. We apply work of Asadi and Eccles on computing Stiefel-Whitney numbers of immersions to show that given a framed immersion $M\to\mathbb{R}^{n+k}$ and choosing $n$ very large with respect to $d$ and $k$, all self-intersection manifolds of an arbitrary element of $\mathrm{Imm}_\xi^d(\mathbb{R}^m\times N)$ are boundary.;math.AT
1801.00737;Even cycle creating paths;We say that two graphs $H_1,H_2$ on the same vertex set are $G$-creating ($G$-different in other papers, this difference is explained in the introduction) if the union of the two graphs contains $G$ as a subgraph. Let $H(n,k)$ be the maximal number of pairwise $C_k$-creating paths (of arbitrary length) on $n$ vertices. The behaviour of $H(n,2k+1)$ is much better understood than the behaviour of $H(n,2k)$, the former is an exponential function of $n$ while the latter is larger than exponential, for every fixed $k$. We study $H(n,k)$ for fixed $k$ and $n$ tending to infinity. The only non trivial upper bound on $H(n,2k)$ was in the case where $k=2$ $$H(n,4)\leq n^{\left(1-\frac{1}{4} \right) n-o(n)}, $$ this was proved by Cohen, Fachini and K\"orner. In this paper, we generalize their method to prove that for every $k \geq 2$, <br />$$H(n,2k) \leq n^{\left( 1- \frac{2}{3k^2-2k} \right)n-o(n)}. $$ Our proof uses constructions of bipartite, regular, $C_{2k}$-free graphs with many edges by Reiman, Benson, Lazebnik, Ustimenko and Woldar. For some special values of $k$ we can have slightly denser such bipartite graphs than for general $k$, this results in having better upper bounds on $H(n,2k)$ than stated above for these special values of $k$.;math.CO
1801.00739;Log canonical pairs over varieties with maximal Albanese dimension;Let $(X,B)$ be a log canonical pair over a normal variety $Z$ with maximal Albanese dimension. If $K_X+B$ is relatively abundant over $Z$ (for example, $K_X+B$ is relatively big over $Z$), then we prove that $K_X+B$ is abundant. In particular, the subadditvity of Kodaira dimensions $\kappa(K_X+B) \geq \kappa(K_F+B_F)+ \kappa(Z)$ holds, where $F$ is a general fiber, $K_F+B_F= (K_X+B)|_F$, and $\kappa(Z)$ means the Kodaira dimension of a smooth model of $Z$. We discuss several variants of this result in Section 4. We also give a remark on the log Iitaka conjecture for log canonical pairs in Section 5.;math.AG
1801.00741;Mixed Boundary Value Problems for non-Divergence Type Elliptic Equations in Unbounded Domain;We investigate the qualitative properties of solution to the Zaremba type problem in unbounded domain for the non-divergence elliptic equation with possible degeneration at infinity. The main result is Phragm\'en-Lindel\"of type principle on growth/decay of a solution at infinity depending on both the structure of the Neumann portion of the boundary and the "thickness" of its Dirichlet portion. The result is formulated in terms of so-called $s$-capacity of the Dirichlet portion of the boundary, while the Neumann boundary should satisfy certain "admissibility" condition in the sequence of layers converging to infinity.;math.AP
1801.00749;Simplicial faces of the set of correlation matrices;This paper concerns the facial geometry of the set of $n \times n$ correlation matrices. The main result states that almost every set of $r$ vertices generates a simplicial face, provided that $r \leq \sqrt{\mathrm{c} n}$, where $\mathrm{c}$ is an absolute constant. This bound is qualitatively sharp because the set of correlation matrices has no simplicial face generated by more than $\sqrt{2n}$ vertices.;math.MG
1801.00754;Fundamental Latency Limits for D2D-Aided Content Delivery in Fog Wireless Networks;Device-to-Device (D2D) communication can support the operation of cellular systems by reducing the traffic in the network infrastructure. In this paper, the benefits of D2D communication are investigated in the context of a Fog-Radio Access Network (F-RAN) that leverages edge caching and fronthaul connectivity for the purpose of content delivery. Assuming offline caching, out-of-band D2D communication, and an F-RAN with two edge nodes and two user equipments, an information-theoretically optimal caching and delivery strategy is presented that minimizes the delivery time in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. The delivery time accounts for the latency caused by fronthaul, downlink, and D2D transmissions. The proposed optimal strategy is based on a novel scheme for an X-channel with receiver cooperation that leverages tools from real interference alignment. Insights are provided on the regimes in which D2D communication is beneficial.;cs.IT
1801.00757;The second Weyl coefficient for a first order system;For a scalar elliptic self-adjoint operator on a compact manifold without boundary we have two-term asymptotics for the number of eigenvalues between zero and lambda when lambda tends to infinity, under an additional dynamical condition. This is a well known result of J.J.Duistermaat and V.W.Guillemin from 1975. <br />In the case of an elliptic system of first order, the existence of two-term asymptotics was also established quite early and as in the scalar case Fourier integral operators have been the crucial tool. The complete computation of the coefficient of the second term was obtained only in 2013. In the present paper we simplify that calculation. The main observation is that with the existence of two-term asymptotics already established, it suffices to study the resolvent as a pseudodifferential operator in order to identify and compute the second coefficient.;math.SP
1801.00760;The cover time of a biased random walk on a random cubic graph;We study a random walk that prefers tou se unvisited edges in the context of random cubic graphs. We establish asymptotically correct estimates for the vertex and edge cover times, these being $\approx n\log n$ and $\approx \frac32n\log n$ respectively.;math.CO
1801.00761;Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with singular drifts: integral estimates and Girsanov densities;We consider a perturbation of a Hilbert space-valued Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process by a class of singular nonlinear non-autonomous maximal monotone time-dependent drifts. The only further assumption on the drift is that it is bounded on balls in the Hilbert space uniformly in time. First we introduce a new notion of generalized solutions for such equations which we call pseudo-weak solutions and prove that they always exist and obtain pathwise estimates in terms of the data of the equation. Then we prove that their laws are absolutely continuous with respect to the law of the original Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process. In particular, we show that pseudo-weak solutions always have continuous sample paths. In addition, we obtain integrability estimates of the associated Girsanov densities. Some of our results concern non-random equations as well, while probabilistic results are new even in finite-dimensional autonomous settings.;math.PR
1801.00763;Koszul almost complete intersections;Let $R = S/I$ be a quotient of a standard graded polynomial ring $S$ by an ideal $I$ generated by quadrics. If $R$ is Koszul, a question of Avramov, Conca, and Iyengar asks whether the Betti numbers of $R$ over $S$ can be bounded above by binomial coefficients on the minimal number of generators of $I$. Motivated by previous results for Koszul algebras defined by three quadrics, we give a complete classification of the structure of Koszul almost complete intersections and, in the process, give an affirmative answer to the above question for all such rings.;math.AC
1801.00767;The local-triviality dimension of actions of compact quantum groups;We define the local-triviality dimension for actions of compact quantum groups on unital C*-algebras. The resulting compact quantum principal bundle is said to be locally trivial when this dimension is finite. For commutative C*-algebras, this notion recovers the standard definition of local triviality of compact principal bundles. We prove that actions with finite local-triviality dimension are automatically free. Then we apply this new notion to prove the noncommutative Borsuk-Ulam-type conjecture under the assumption that a compact quantum group admits a non-trivial classical subgroup whose induced action has finite local-triviality dimension. This is a noncommutative extension of the Borsuk-Ulam-type theorem for locally trivial principal bundles.;math.OA
1801.00770;The set of non-uniquely ergodic d-IETs has Hausdorff codimension 1/2;We show that the set of not uniquely ergodic d-IETs has Hausdorff dimension d-3/2 (in the (d-1)-dimension space of d-IETs) for d&gt,4. For d=4 this was shown by Athreya-Chaika and for d=2,3 the set is known to have dimension d-2.;math.DS
1801.00771;A note on logarithmic growth of solutions of $p$-adic differential equations without solvability;For a $p$-adic differential equation solvable in an open disc (in a $p$-adic sense), around 1970, Dwork proves that the solutions satisfy a certain growth condition on the boundary. Dwork also conjectures that a similar phenomenon should be observed without assuming the solvability. In this paper, we verify Dwork's conjecture in the rank two case, which is the first non-trivial result on the conjecture. The proof is an application of Kedlaya's decomposition theorem of $p$-adic differential equations defined over annulus.;math.NT
1801.00780;A Mathematical Analysis of Dirac Equation Physics;The paper analyzes time propagation of Dirac observables - using Heisenberg representation - in the light of various pseudodifferential operator algebras (cf. [Co3], [Co15], [Co16]). Our theory gives (i) a mechanical angular momentum (the spin), but also (ii) another real 3-vector, travelling with the particle, with magnetic properties (its motion guided by the magnetic field around it, but not in the proper relativistic way). The above is discussed for potentials vanishing at infinity. But we also look at a Dirac particle in the field of a plane polarized X-ray wave, trying to analyze the Compton effect. The propagations of energy and momentum (in the X-ray's direction) are coupled - they allow a joint asymptotic expansion with terms representing change of energy by $nh\nu$ and momentum by $nh\nu/c$, with n=0,1,2, ..., valid for large frequencies, i.e., large momentum coordinates. Possible interpretation: A collision of the electron-positron with 0, 1, 2, ... n Photons of energy $h\nu$, affecting a change of energy-momentum. Note, this does not require QFT.;math-ph
1801.00781;Gibbs measures of an Ising model with competing interactions on the triangular chandelier-lattice;In this paper, we consider an Ising model with three competing interactions on a triangular chandelier-lattice (TCL). We describe the existence, uniqueness, and non-uniqueness of translation-invariant Gibbs measures associated with the Ising model. We obtain an explicit formula for Gibbs measures with a memory of length 2 satisfying consistency conditions. It is rigorously proved that the model exhibits phase transitions only for given values of the coupling constants. As a consequence of our approach, the dichotomy between alternative solutions of Hamiltonian models on TCLs is solved. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.;math-ph
1801.00782;Trapezoidal type inequalities related to h-convex functions with applications;A mapping M(t) is considered to obtain some preliminary results and a new trapezoidal form of Fejer inequality related to the h-convex functions. Furthermore the obtained results are applied to achieve some new inequalities in connection with special means, random variable and trapezoidal formula.;math.FA
1801.00784;Expansion of Iterated Stratonovich Stochastic Integrals of Arbitrary Multiplicity Based on Generalized Iterated Fourier Series Converging Pointwise;The article is devoted to the expansion of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of arbitrary multiplicity $k$ $(k\in\mathbb{N})$ based on the generalized iterated Fourier series converging pointwise. The case of Fourier-Legendre series as well as the case of trigonometric Fourier series are considered in details. The obtained expansion provides a possibility to represent the iterated Stratonovich stochastic integral in the form of iterated series of products of standard Gaussian random variables. Convergence in the mean of degree $2n$ $(n\in \mathbb{N})$ of the expansion is proved. Some modifications of the mentioned expansion were derived for the case $k=2$. One of them is based of multiple trigonometric Fourier series converging almost everywhere in the square $[t, T]^2$. The results of the article can be applied to the numerical solution of Ito stochastic differential equations.;math.PR
1801.00785;Geometric presentation for the cohomology ring of polygon spaces;We describe the cohomology ring of the moduli space of a flexible polygon in geometrically meaningful terms. We propose two presentations, both are computation friendly: there are simple rules for cup product.;math.GT
1801.00803;On full Zakharov equation and its approximations;We study the solvability of the Zakharov equation $$\Delta^2 u + (\kappa-\omega^2)\Delta u - \kappa \,\text{div} \left(e^{-|\nabla u|^2} \nabla u\right) = 0$$ in a bounded domain under homogeneous Dirichlet or Navier boundary conditions. This problem is a consequence of the system of equations derived by Zakharov to model the Langmuir collapse in plasma physics. Assumptions for the existence and nonexistence of a ground state solution as well as the multiplicity of solutions are discussed. Moreover, we consider formal approximations of the Zakharov equation obtained by the Taylor expansion of the exponential term. We illustrate that the existence and nonexistence results are substantially different from the corresponding results for the original problem.;math.AP
1801.00812;Limit shapes for Gibbs ensembles of partitions;We explicitly compute limit shapes for several grand canonical Gibbs ensembles of partitions of integers. These ensembles appear in models of aggregation and are also related to invariant measures of zero range and coagulation-fragmentation processes. We show, that all possible limit shapes for these ensembles fall into several distinct classes determined by the asymptotics of the internal energies of aggregates.;math-ph
1801.00813;Force appropriation of nonlinear structures;Nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) are widely used as a tool for developing mathematical models of nonlinear structures and understanding their dynamics. NNMs can be identified experimentally through a phase quadrature condition between the system response and the applied excitation. This paper demonstrates that this commonly-used quadrature condition can give results that are significantly different from the true NNM, in particular when the excitation applied to the system is limited to one input force, as is frequently used in practice. The system studied is a clamped-clamped cross beam with two closely-spaced modes. This paper shows that the regions where the quadrature condition is (in)accurate can be qualitatively captured by analysing transfer of energy between the modes of the system, leading to a discussion of the appropriate number of input forces and their locations across the structure.;math.DS
1801.00819;Block row recursive least squares migration;Recursive estimates of large systems of equations in the context of least squares fitting is a common practice in different fields of study. For example, recursive adaptive filtering is extensively used in signal processing and control applications. The necessity of solving least squares problem via recursive algorithms comes from the need of fast real-time signal processing strategies. Computational cost of using least squares algorithm could also limits the applicability of this technique in geophysical problems. In this paper, we consider recursive least squares solution for wave equation least squares migration with sliding windows involving several rank K downdating and updating computations. This technique can be applied for dynamic and stationary processes. One can show that in the case of stationary processes, the spectrum of the preconditioned system is clustered around one and the method will converge superlinearly with probability one, if we use enough data in each windowed setup. Numerical experiments are reported in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the technique for least squares migration.;math.NA
1801.00827;Computing images of polynomial maps;The image of a polynomial map is a constructible set. While computing its closure is standard in computer algebra systems, a procedure for computing the constructible set itself is not. We provide a new algorithm, based on algebro-geometric techniques, addressing this problem. We also apply these methods to answer a question of W. Hackbusch on the non-closedness of site-independent cyclic matrix product states for infinitely many parameters.;math.AG
1801.00828;Extrapolation for the $L^p$ Dirichlet Problem in Lipschitz domains;Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a second-order linear elliptic operator with complex coefficients. We show that if the $L^p$ Dirichlet problem for the elliptic system $\mathcal{L}(u)=0$ in a fixed Lipschitz domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is solvable for some $1&lt,p=p_0&lt, \frac{2(d-1)}{d-2}$, then it is solvable for all $p$ satisfying $$ p_0&lt,p&lt, \frac{2(d-1)}{d-2} +\varepsilon. $$ The proof is based on a real-variable argument. It only requires that local solutions of $\mathcal{L}(u)=0$ satisfy a boundary Cacciopoli inequality.;math.AP
1801.00832;The Dixmier-Douady Classes of Certain Groupoid $C^*$-Algebras with Continuous Trace;Given a locally compact abelian group $G$, we give an explicit formula for the Dixmier--Douady invariant of the $C^*$-algebra of the groupoid extension associated to a \v{C}ech $2$-cocycle in the sheaf of germs of continuous $G$-valued functions. We then exploit the blow-up construction for groupoids to extend this to some more general central extensions of \'etale equivalence relations.;math.OA
1801.00836;Asymptotic models for transport in large aspect ratio nanopores;Ion flow in charged nanopores is strongly influenced by the ratio of the Debye length to the pore radius. We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) system in narrow pore like geometries and study the influence of the pore geometry and surface charge on ion transport. The physical properties of real pores motivate the investigation of distinguished asymptotic limits, in which either the Debye length and pore radius are comparable or the pore length is very much greater than its radius. This results in a Quasi-1D PNP model which can be further simplified, in the physically relevant limit of strong pore wall surface charge, to a fully one-dimensional model. Favourable comparison is made to the two-dimensional PNP equations in typical pore geometries. It is also shown that, for physically realistic parameters, the standard 1D Area Averaged PNP model for ion flow through a pore is a very poor approximation to the (real) two-dimensional solution to the PNP equations. This leads us to propose that the Quasi-1D PNP model derived here, whose computational cost is significantly less than two-dimensional solution of the PNP equations, should replace the use of the 1D Area Averaged PNP equations as a tool to investigate ion and current flows in ion pores.;math.AP
1801.00838;Differential equations in automorphic forms;Physicists such as Green, Vanhove, et al show that differential equations involving automorphic forms govern the behavior of gravitons. One particular point of interest is solutions to $(\Delta-\lambda)u=E_{\alpha} E_{\beta}$ on an arithmetic quotient of the exceptional group $E_8$. We establish that the existence of a solution to $(\Delta-\lambda)u=E_{\alpha}E_{\beta}$ on the simpler space $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})\backslash SL_2(\mathbb{R})$ for certain values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ depends on nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$. Further, when such a solution exists, we use spectral theory to solve $(\Delta-\lambda)u=E_{\alpha}E_{\beta}$ on $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})\backslash SL_2(\mathbb{R})$ and provide proof of the meromorphic continuation of the solution. The construction of such a solution uses Arthur truncation, the Maass-Selberg formula, and automorphic Sobolev spaces.;math.NT
1801.00846;Linear iterative schemes for doubly degenerate parabolic equations;Mathematical models for flow and reactive transport in porous media often involve non-linear, degenerate parabolic equations. Their solutions have low regularity, and therefore lower order schemes are used for the numerical approximation. Here the backward Euler method is combined with a mixed finite element method scheme, which results in a stable and locally mass-conservative scheme. At the same time, at each time step one has to solve a non-linear algebraic system, for which linear iterations are needed. Finding robust and convergent ones is particularly challenging here, since both slow and fast diffusion cases are allowed. <br />Commonly used schemes, like Newton and Picard iterations, are defined either for non-degenerate problems, or after regularising the problem in the case of degenerate ones. Convergence is guaranteed only if the initial guess is sufficiently close to the solution, which translates into severe restrictions on the time step. Here we discuss a linear iterative scheme which builds on the $L$-scheme, and does not employ any regularisation. We prove its rigourous convergence, which is obtained for mild restrictions on the time step. Finally, we give numerical results confirming the theoretical ones, and compare the behaviour of the scheme with other schemes.;math.NA
1801.00847;Analysis of Hierarchical Ensemble Kalman Inversion;We discuss properties of hierarchical Bayesian inversion through the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Our focus will be primarily on deriving continuous-time limits for hierarchical inversion in the linear case. An important characteristic of the EnKF for inverse problems is that the updated particles are preserved by the linear span of the initial ensemble. By incorporating certain hierarchical approaches we show that we can break away from the induced subspace property. We further consider a number of variants of the EnKF such as covariance inflation and localization, where we derive their continuous-time limits. We verify these results with various numerical experiments through a linear elliptic partial differential equation.;math.NA
1801.00852;A Concentration Result of Estimating Phi-Divergence using Data Dependent Partition;Estimation of the $\phi$-divergence between two unknown probability distributions using empirical data is a fundamental problem in information theory and statistical learning. We consider a multi-variate generalization of the data dependent partitioning method for estimating divergence between the two unknown distributions. Under the assumption that the distribution satisfies a power law of decay, we provide a convergence rate result for this method on the number of samples and hyper-rectangles required to ensure the estimation error is bounded by a given level with a given probability.;math.PR
1801.00856;Phylogenetic trees and homomorphisms;In Chapter 1 we fully characterise pairs of finite graphs which form a gap in the full homomorphism order. This leads to a simple proof of the existence of generalised duality pairs. We also discuss how such results can be carried to relational structures with unary and binary relations. In Chapter 2 we show a very simple and versatile argument based on divisibility which immediately yields the universality of the homomorphism order of directed graphs and discuss three applications. In chapter 3, we show that every interval in the homomorphism order of finite undirected graphs is either universal or a gap. Together with density and universality this "fractal" property contributes to the spectacular properties of the homomorphism order. In Chapter 4 we analyze the phylogenetic information content from a combinatorial point of view by considering the binary relation on the set of taxa defined by the existence of a single event separating two taxa. We show that the graph-representation of this relation must be a tree. Moreover, we characterize completely the relationship between the tree of such relations and the underlying phylogenetic tree.;math.CO
1801.00869;On properties of Bourgeois contact structures;The Bourgeois construction associates to every contact open book on a manifold $V$ a contact structure on $V\times T^2$. We study in this article some of the properties of $V$ that are inherited by $V\times T^2$ and some that are not. <br />Giroux has provided recently a suitable framework to work with contact open books. In the appendix of this article, we quickly review this formalism, and we work out a few classical examples of contact open books to illustrate how to use this new language.;math.SG
1801.00871;Frobenius Reciprocity for Topological Groups;We investigate the existence of left and right adjoints to the restriction functor in three categories of continuous representations of a topological group: discrete, linear complete and compact.;math.RT
1801.00872;On the integral Hodge conjecture for real varieties, I;We formulate the "real integral Hodge conjecture", a version of the integral Hodge conjecture for real varieties, and raise the question of its validity for cycles of dimension 1 on uniruled and Calabi-Yau threefolds and on rationally connected varieties. We relate it to the problem of determining the image of the Borel-Haefliger cycle class map for 1-cycles, with the problem of deciding whether a real variety with no real point contains a curve of even geometric genus and with the problem of computing the torsion of the Chow group of 1-cycles of real threefolds. New results about these problems are obtained along the way.;math.AG
1801.00873;On the integral Hodge conjecture for real varieties, II;We establish the real integral Hodge conjecture for 1-cycles on various classes of uniruled threefolds (conic bundles, Fano threefolds with no real point, some del Pezzo fibrations) and on conic bundles over higher-dimensional bases which themselves satisfy the real integral Hodge conjecture for 1-cycles. In addition, we show that rationally connected threefolds over non-archimedean real closed fields do not satisfy the real integral Hodge conjecture in general and that over such fields, Br\"ocker's EPT theorem remains true for simply connected surfaces of geometric genus zero but fails for some K3 surfaces.;math.AG
1801.00875;On the growth of the number of totally geodesic surfaces in some hyperbolic $3$-manifolds;Let $d$ be a positive square-free integer $\equiv 3 \pmod{4}$ such that there is no invariant of the ideal class group $\mathbb{Q}\lbrack \sqrt{-d}\rbrack$ which is divisible by $4$. We prove an asymptotic formula for the number of immersed totally geodesic surfaces in $\Gamma_{-d}\backslash \mathbb{H}^3$ having area less than $X$.;math.NT
1801.00876;Eigenvalues of random lifts and polynomials of random permutation matrices;Consider a finite sequence of independent random permutations, chosen uniformly either among all permutations or among all matchings on n points. We show that, in probability, as n goes to infinity, these permutations viewed as operators on the (n-1) dimensional vector space orthogonal to the vector with all coordinates equal to 1, are asymptotically strongly free. Our proof relies on the development of a matrix version of the non-backtracking operator theory and a refined trace method. <br />As a byproduct, we show that the non-trivial eigenvalues of random n-lifts of a fixed based graphs approximately achieve the Alon-Boppana bound with high probability in the large n limit. This result generalizes Friedman's Theorem stating that with high probability, the Schreier graph generated by a finite number of independent random permutations is close to Ramanujan. <br />Finally, we extend our results to tensor products of random permutation matrices. This extension is especially relevant in the context of quantum expanders.;math.PR
1801.00878;Moment bounds of a class of stochastic heat equations driven by space-time colored noise in bounded domains;We consider the fractional stochastic heat type equation <br />\begin{align*} <br />\frac{\partial}{\partial t} u_t(x)=-(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}u_t(x)+\xi\sigma(u_t(x))\dot{F}(t,x),\ \ \ x\in D, \ \ t&gt,0, <br />\end{align*} <br />with nonnegative bounded initial condition, where $\alpha\in (0,2]$, $\xi&gt,0$ is the noise level, $\sigma:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a globally Lipschitz function satisfying some growth conditions and the noise term behaves in space like the Riez kernel and is possibly correlated in time and $D$ is the unit open ball centered at the origin in $\mathbb{R}^d$. When the noise term is not correlated in time, we establish a change in the growth of the solution of these equations depending on the noise level $\xi$. On the other hand when the noise term behaves in time like the fractional Brownian motion with index $H\in (1/2,1)$, We also derive explicit bounds leading to a well-known intermittency property.;math.PR
1801.00884;Structure-Preserving &#x393,QR and &#x393,-Lanczos Algorithms for Bethe-Salpeter Eigenvalue Problems;To solve the Bethe-Salpeter eigenvalue problem with distinct sizes, two efficient methods, called {\Gamma}QR algorithm and {\Gamma}-Lanczos algorithm, are proposed in this paper. Both algorithms preserve the special structure of the initial matrix $H=\begin{bmatrix}A &amp, B-\overline{B} &amp, -\overline{A}\end{bmatrix}$, resulting the computed eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors still hold the properties similar to those of $H$. Theorems are given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed two algorithms in theory. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the superiorities of our methods.;math.NA
1801.00889;A Note on the Lipschitz Selection;We present an alternate proof of the passage from the finiteness principle for metric trees to the construction of the core in the C. Fefferman and Shvartsman finiteness theorem for Lipschitz selection problems.;math.FA
1801.00893;Reliable OFDM Receiver with Ultra-Low Resolution ADC;The use of low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) can significantly reduce power consumption and hardware cost. However, their resulting severe nonlinear distortion makes reliable data transmission challenging. For orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission, the orthogonality among subcarriers is destroyed. This invalidates conventional OFDM receivers relying heavily on this orthogonality. In this study, we move on to quantized OFDM (Q-OFDM) prototyping implementation based on our previous achievement in optimal Q-OFDM detection. First, we propose a novel Q-OFDM channel estimator by extending the generalized Turbo (GTurbo) framework formerly applied for optimal detection. Specifically, we integrate a type of robust linear OFDM channel estimator into the original GTurbo framework and derive its corresponding extrinsic information to guarantee its convergence. We also propose feasible schemes for automatic gain control, noise power estimation, and synchronization. Combined with the proposed inference algorithms, we develop an efficient Q-OFDM receiver architecture. Furthermore, we construct a proof-of-concept prototyping system and conduct over-the-air (OTA) experiments to examine its feasibility and reliability. This is the first work that focuses on both algorithm design and system implementation in the field of low-resolution quantization communication. The results of the numerical simulation and OTA experiment demonstrate that reliable data transmission can be achieved.;cs.IT
1801.00896;Parity sheaves and the Hecke category;The Hecke category is emerging as a fundamental object in representation theory. We give a motivated introduction to this category in both its geometric (via parity sheaves) and diagrammatic (generators and relations) incarnations. We also discuss the p-canonical basis and Koszul duality for the Hecke category.;math.RT
1801.00898;Differential Geometry for Model Independent Analysis of Images and Other Non-Euclidean Data: Recent Developments;This article provides an exposition of recent methodologies for nonparametric analysis of digital observations on images and other non-Euclidean objects. Fr\'echet means of distributions on metric spaces, such as manifolds and stratified spaces, have played an important role in this endeavor. Apart from theoretical issues of uniqueness of the Fr\'echet minimizer and the asymptotic distribution of the sample Fr\'echet mean under uniqueness, applications to image analysis are highlighted. In addition, nonparametric Bayes theory is brought to bear on the problems of density estimation and classification on manifolds.;math.ST
1801.00900;Doubling algorithm for the discretized Bethe-Salpeter eigenvalue problem;The discretized Bethe-Salpeter eigenvalue problem arises in the Green's function evaluation in many body physics and quantum chemistry. Discretization leads to a matrix eigenvalue problem for $H \in \mathbb{C}^{2n\times 2n}$ with a Hamiltonian-like structure. After an appropriate transformation of $H$ to a standard symplectic form, the structure-preserving doubling algorithm, originally for algebraic Riccati equations, is extended for the discretized Bethe-Salpeter eigenvalue problem. Potential breakdowns of the algorithm, due to the ill condition or singularity of certain matrices, can be avoided with a double-Cayley transform or a three-recursion remedy. A detailed convergence analysis is conducted for the proposed algorithm, especially on the benign effects of the double-Cayley transform. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and structure-preserving nature of the algorithm.;math.NA
1801.00901;Bounded birationality and isomorphism problems are computable;Let $X,Y$ be two irreducible subvarieties of the projective space $\mathbb{P}^n$, and $d\geq 1$ an integer number. The main result of this paper is an algorithm to construct {\bf explicitly}, in terms of $d$ and the ideals defining $X$ and $Y$, a quasi-affine algebraic variety parametrising the set of all birational maps $f$ from $X$ onto $Y$ which can be extended to a self-rational map of $\mathbb{P}^n$ of degree $\leq d$. <br />Based on this result, we propose an approach towards the rationality problem (see Section 3 below), solve it for some simple cases (varieties of general type or curves), and state a rough strategy for reducing it to some simpler cases via Iitaka's fibrations. <br />We also prove similar results for the case $f$ is a dominant rational map, regular morphism, isomorphism or regular embedding. Similar results are valid for varieties over an arbitrary algebraically closed field, and also for maps on non-projective varieties.;math.AG
1801.00919;Compact-Like Operators in Vector Lattices Normed by Locally Solid Lattices;A linear operator $T$ between two vector lattices normed by locally solid Riesz spaces is said to be $p_\tau$-continuous if, for any $p_\tau$-null net $(x_\alpha)$, the net $(Tx_\alpha)$ is $p_\tau$-null, and $T$ is said to be $p_\tau$-bounded operator if it sends $p_\tau$-bounded subsets to $p_\tau$-bounded subsets. Also, $T$ is called $p_\tau$-compact if, for any $p_\tau$-bounded net $(x_\alpha)$, the net $(Tx_\alpha)$ has a $p_\tau$-convergent subnet. They generalize several known classes of operators such as norm continuous, order continuous, $p$-continuous, order bounded, $p$-bounded, compact and AM-compact operators. We study the general properties of these operators.;math.FA
1801.00921;A finite field analogue of the Appell series $F_4$;We define a function $F_4^{\ast}$ as a finite field analogue of the classical Appell series $F_4$ using Gauss sums. We establish identities for $F_4^{\ast}$ analogous to those satisfied by the classical Appell series $F_4$.;math.NT
1801.00922;Motivic spectral sequence for relative homotopy K-theory;We construct a motivic spectral sequence for the relative homotopy invariant K-theory of a closed immersion of schemes $D \subset X$. The $E_2$-terms of this spectral sequence are the cdh-hypercohomology of a complex of equi-dimensional cycles. <br />Using this spectral sequence, we obtain a cycle class map from the relative motivic cohomology group of 0-cycles to the relative homotopy invariant K-theory. For a smooth scheme $X$ and a divisor $D \subset X$, we construct a canonical homomorphism from the Chow groups with modulus $\CH^i(X|D)$ to the relative motivic cohomology groups $H^{2i}(X|D, \Z(i))$ appearing in the above spectral sequence. This map is shown to be an isomorphism when $X$ is affine and $i = \dim(X)$.;math.AG
1801.00923;On the Application of Reduced Basis Methods to Bifurcation Problems in Incompressible Fluid Dynamics;In this paper we apply a reduced basis framework for the computation of flow bifurcation (and stability) problems in fluid dynamics. The proposed method aims at reducing the complexity and the computational time required for the construction of bifurcation and stability diagrams. The method is quite general since it can in principle be specialized to a wide class of nonlinear problems, but in this work we focus on an application in incompressible fluid dynamics at low Reynolds numbers. The validation of the reduced order model with the full order computation for a benchmark cavity flow problem is promising.;math.NA
1801.00924;Joint Content Delivery and Caching Placement via Dynamic Programming;In this paper, downlink delivery of popular content is optimized with the assistance of wireless cache nodes. Specifically, the requests of one file is modeled as a Poisson point process with finite lifetime, and two downlink transmission modes are considered: (1) the base station multicasts file segments to the requesting users and selected cache nodes, (2) the base station proactively multicasts file segments to the selected cache nodes without requests from users. Hence the cache nodes with decoded files can help to offload the traffic upon the next file request via other air interfaces, e.g. WiFi. Without proactive caching placement, we formulate the downlink traffic offloading as a Markov decision process with random number of stages, and propose a revised Bellman's equation to obtain the optimal control policy. In order to address the prohibitively huge state space, we also introduce a low-complexity sub-optimal solution based on linear approximation of the value functions, where the gap between the approximated value functions and the real ones is bounded analytically. The approximated value functions can be calculated from analytical expressions given the spatial distribution of requesting users. Moreover, we propose a learning-based algorithm to evaluate the approximated value functions for unknown distribution of requesting users. Finally, a proactive caching placement algorithm is introduced to exploit the temporal diversity of shadowing effect. It is shown by simulation that the proposed low-complexity algorithm based on approximated value functions can significantly reduce the resource consumption at the base station, and the proactive caching placement can further improve the performance.;cs.IT
1801.00925;Transcendental singularities for a meromorphic function with logarithmic derivative of finite lower order;In this note it is shown that two key results on transcendental singularities for meromorphic functions of finite lower order have refinements which hold under the weaker hypothesis that the logarithmic derivative has finite lower order.;math.CV

1801.00931;A discrete event traffic model explaining the traffic phases of the train dynamics in a metro line system with a junction;This paper presents a mathematical model for the train dynamics in a mass-transit metro line system with one symmetrically operated junction. We distinguish three parts: a central part and two branches. The tracks are spatially discretized into segments (or blocks) and the train dynamics are described by a discrete event system where the variables are the $k^{th}$ departure times from each segment. The train dynamics are based on two main constraints: a travel time constraint modeling theoretic run and dwell times, and a safe separation constraint modeling the signaling system in case where the traffic gets very dense. The Max-plus algebra model allows to analytically derive the asymptotic average train frequency as a function of many parameters, including train travel times, minimum safety intervals, the total number of trains on the line and the number of trains on each branch. This derivation permits to understand the physics of traffic. In a further step, the results will be used for traffic control.;math.OC
1801.00941;Rigidity results in Diffusion Markov Triples;We consider stable solutions of semilinear equations in a very general setting. The equation is set on a Polish topological space endowed with a measure and the linear operator is induced by a carr\'e du champs (equivalently, the equation is set in a diffusion Markov triple). Under suitable curvature dimension conditions, we establish that stable solutions with integrable carr\'e du champs are necessarily constant (weaker conditions characterize the structure of the carr\'e du champs and carr\'e du champ it\'er\'e). The proofs are based on a geometric Poincar\'e formula in this setting. From the general theorems established, several previous results are obtained as particular cases and new ones are provided as well.;math.AP
1801.00947;Modulus Zero-Forcing Detection for MIMO Channels;We propose a modulus based zero-forcing (MZF) detection for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channels. Traditionally, a ZF detector nulls out all interferences from other layers when detecting a current layer, which can yield suboptimal detection-performance due to the noise-enhancement issue. In many communication systems, finite alphabets such as M quadrature-amplitude-modulation (QAM) are widely used, which comprises \sqrt{M} pulse-amplitude-modulation (PAM) symbols for the real and imaginary parts. With finite alphabets, one feasible way to improve ZF detection is to allow controllable interferences that can be removed away by modulus operations.;cs.IT
1801.00950;Barotropic instability of shear flows;We consider barotropic instability of shear flows for incompressible fluids with Coriolis effects. For a class of shear flows, we develop a new method to find the sharp stability conditions. We study the flow with Sinus profile in details and obtain the sharp stability boundary in the whole parameter space, which corrects previous results in the fluid literature. Our new results are confirmed by more accurate numerical computation. The addition of the Coriolis force is found to bring fundamental changes to the stability of shear flows. Moreover, we study dynamical behaviors near the shear flows, including the bifurcation of nontrivial traveling wave solutions and the linear inviscid damping. The first ingredient of our proof is a careful classification of the neutral modes. The second one is to write the linearized fluid equation in a Hamiltonian form and then use an instability index theory for general Hamiltonian PDEs. The last one is to study the singular and non-resonant neutral modes using Sturm-Liouville theory and hypergeometric functions.;math.AP

We focus on the centrally essential modular group algebras of finite groups over fields of nonzero characteristic.

1801.00952;Non-isometric domains with the same Marvizi-Melrose invariants;For any strictly convex planar domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ with a $C^\infty$ boundary one can associate an infinite sequence of spectral invariants introduced by Marvizi-Merlose. These invariants can generically be determined using the spectrum of the Dirichlet problem of the Laplace operator. A natural question asks if this collection is sufficient to determine $\Omega$ up to isometry. In this paper we give a counterexample, namely, we present two non-isometric domains $\Omega$ and $\bar \Omega$ with the same collection of Marvizi-Melrose invariants. Moreover, each domain has countably many periodic orbits $\{S^n\}_{n \geqslant 1}$ (resp. $\{ \bar S^n\}_{n \geqslant 1}$) of period going to infinity such that $ S^n $ and $ \bar S^n $ have the same period and perimeter for each $ n $.;math.DS
1801.00953;Admissibility and the $C_2$ Spider;A tensor category is multiplicity-free if for any objects $A,B,C$ we have that $\mathrm{Hom}(A\otimes B\otimes C,\mathbb{C})$ is either $0$ or $1$ dimensional. It is known that $Rep^{uni}(U_q(\mathfrak{sp}(4)))$ is not multiplicty-free. We find a full subcategory of $Rep^{uni}(U_q(\mathfrak{sp}(4)))$ which is multiplicty-free. A description of the dimension of these $\mathrm{Hom}$ spaces is given for this subcategory, including when $q$ is a root of unity. The methods used arise from the description, given by Kuperberg, of $Rep^{uni}(U_q(\mathfrak{sp}(4)))$ as a spider. The main tool is the recursive definition of clasps given by Kim. In particular, we provide an appropriate notion of admissibility when looking at the $\mathrm{Sp}(4)_k$ ribbon graph invariants with restricted edge labels.;math.QA
1801.00957;Exponential stabilization of cascade ode-reaction-diffusion pde by pointwise actuation;In this paper, we are concerned with the state feedback stabilization of ODE-PDE cascade systems governed by a linear ordinary differential equation and the 1-d reaction-diffusion equation posed on a bounded interval. In contrast to the previous works in the literature where the control acts at the boundary, the control for the entire system acts at an inside point of the PDE domain whereas the PDE acts in the linear ODE by a Neumann connection. We use the infinite dimensional backstepping design to convert system under consideration to an exponentially target system. By invertibility of the design and Lyapunov analysis, we prove the well posedness and exponential stability of such system.;math.AP
1801.00958;Exponential stabilization of cascade ode-linearized kdv system by boundary Dirichlet actuation;In this paper, we solve the problem of exponential stabilization for a class of cascade ODE-PDE system governed by a linear ordinary differential equation and a 1-d linearized Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV) posed on a bounded interval. The control for the entire system acts on the left boundary with Dirichlet condition of the KdV equation whereas the KdV acts in the linear ODE by a Dirichlet connection. We use the socalled backstepping design in infinite dimension to convert the system under consideration into an exponentially stable cascade ODE-PDE system.Then, we use the invertibility of such design to achieve the exponential stability for the ODE-PDE cascade system under consideration by using Lyapunov analysis.;math.AP
1801.00961;On maximum distance separable group codes with complementary duals;Given an LCD group code $C$ in a group algebra $KG$, we inspect kinship between $C$ and $G$, more precisely between the subgroup structures of $G$ and $C$. Under some special circumstances our inspection provides an estimation for various parameters of a group code $C$. When $C$ is MDS, the inter relation between $K$ and $G$ becomes more impressive. Application of Sylow theorem facilitated us to explore the inter relation between $G$ and $K$ (when $C$ is LCD and MDS) in more general way and finally we get the result of Cruz and Willems (Lemma $4.4$) as a simple sequel.;math.RA
1801.00963;A New Design Paradigm for Secure Full-Duplex Multiuser Systems;We consider a full-duplex (FD) multiuser system where an FD base station (BS) is designed to simultaneously serve both downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) users in the presence of half-duplex eavesdroppers (Eves). The problem is to maximize the minimum (max-min) secrecy rate (SR) among all legitimate users, where the information signals at the FD-BS are accompanied with artificial noise to debilitate the Eves' channels. To enhance the max-min SR, a major part of the power budget should be allocated to serve the users with poor channel qualities, such as those far from the FD-BS, undermining the SR for other users, and thus compromising the SR per-user. In addition, the main obstacle in designing an FD system is due to the self-interference (SI) and co-channel interference (CCI) among users. We therefore propose an alternative solution, where the FD-BS uses a fraction of the time block to serve near DL users and far UL users, and the remaining fractional time to serve other users. The proposed scheme mitigates the harmful effects of SI, CCI and multiuser interference, and provides system robustness. The SR optimization problem has a highly nonconcave and nonsmooth objective, subject to nonconvex constraints. For the case of perfect channel state information (CSI), we develop a low-complexity path-following algorithm, which involves only a simple convex program of moderate dimension at each iteration. We show that our path-following algorithm guarantees convergence at least to a local optimum. Then, we extend the path-following algorithm to the cases of partially known Eves' CSI, where only statistics of CSI for the Eves are known, and worst-case scenario in which Eves can employ a more advanced linear decoder. The merit of our proposed approach is further demonstrated by extensive numerical results.;cs.IT
1801.00965;Phase Transition of Convex Programs for Linear Inverse Problems with Multiple Prior Constraints;A sharp phase transition emerges in convex programs when solving the linear inverse problem, which aims to recover a structured signal from its linear measurements. This paper studies this phenomenon in theory under Gaussian random measurements. Different from previous studies, in this paper, we consider convex programs with multiple prior constraints. These programs are encountered in many cases, for example, when the signal is sparse and its $\ell_2$ norm is known beforehand, or when the signal is sparse and non-negative simultaneously. Given such a convex program, to analyze its phase transition, we introduce a new set and a new cone, called the prior restricted set and prior restricted cone, respectively. Our results reveal that the phase transition of a convex problem occurs at the statistical dimension of its prior restricted cone. Moreover, to apply our theoretical results in practice, we present two recipes to accurately estimate the statistical dimension of the prior restricted cone. These two recipes work under different conditions, and we give a detailed analysis for them. To further illustrate our results, we apply our theoretical results and the estimation recipes to study the phase transition of two specific problems, and obtain computable formulas for the statistical dimension and related error bounds. Simulations are provided to demonstrate our results.;cs.IT

We define these transforms in such a way that they characterize any probability distribution on the real line and are Fenchel conjugates of each other. We show that uniform integrability, weak convergence and tightness admit a convenient characterization in terms of integrated quantile functions. As an application we demonstrate how some basic results of the theory of comparison of binary statistical experiments can be deduced using integrated quantile functions. Finally, we extend the area of application of the Chacon--Walsh construction in the Skorokhod embedding problem.;math.PR

1801.00981;A Model-Free Selection Criterion For The Mixing Coefficient Of Spatial Max-Mixture Models;One of the main concerns in extreme value theory is to quantify the dependence between joint tails. Using stochastic processes that lack flexibility in the joint tail may lead to severe under-or over-estimation of probabilities associated to simultaneous extreme events. Following recent advances in the literature, a flexible model called max-mixture model has been introduced for modeling situations where the extremal dependence structure may vary with the distance. In this paper we propose a nonparametric model-free selection criterion for the mixing coefficient Our criterion is derived from a madogram, a notion classically used in geostatistics to capture spatial structures. The procedure is based on a nonlinear least squares between the theoretical madogram and the empirical one. We perform a simulation study and apply our criterion to daily precipitation over the East of Australia.;math.ST
1801.00983;Stabilisation of wave equations on the torus with rough dampings;For the damped wave equation on a compact manifold with {\em continuous} dampings, the geometric control condition is necessary and sufficient for {uniform} stabilisation. In this article, on the two dimensional torus, in the special case where $a(x) = \sum\_{j=1}^N a\_j 1\_{x\in R\_j}$ ($R\_j$ are polygons), we give a very simple necessary and sufficient geometric condition for uniform stabilisation. We also propose a natural generalization of the geometric control condition which makes sense for $L^\infty$ dampings. We show that this condition is always necessary for uniform stabilisation (for any compact (smooth) manifold and any $L^\infty$ damping), and we prove that it is sufficient in our particular case on $\mathbb{T}^2$ (and for our particular dampings).;math.AP

By nonzero rectangular Kronecker coefficients, we give counterexamples for Klyachko's conjecture which says that a quantum state with maximal lexicographical spectrum has minimal rank among all states with given margins. Moreover, we show that quantum states with the maximal lexicographical spectrum are extreme points.;math.RT
1801.00988;Joint Uplink and Downlink Resource Configuration for Ultra-reliable and Low-latency Communications;Supporting ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) is one of the major goals for the fifth-generation cellular networks. Since spectrum usage efficiency is always a concern, and large bandwidth is required for ensuring stringent quality-of-service (QoS), we minimize the total bandwidth under the QoS constraints of URLLC. We first propose a packet delivery mechanism for URLLC. To reduce the required bandwidth for ensuring queueing delay, we consider a statistical multiplexing queueing mode, where the packets to be sent to different devices are waiting in one queue at the base station, and broadcast mode is adopted in downlink transmission. In this way, downlink bandwidth is shared among packets of multiple devices. In uplink transmission, different subchannels are allocated to different devices to avoid strong interference. Then, we jointly optimize uplink and downlink bandwidth configuration and delay components to minimize the total bandwidth required to guarantee the overall packet loss and end-to-end delay, which includes uplink and downlink transmission delays, queueing delay and backhaul delay. We propose a two-step method to find the optimal solution. Simulation and numerical results validate our analysis and show remarkable performance gain by jointly optimizing uplink and downlink configuration.;cs.IT
1801.00989;On the invariance equation for two-variable weighted nonsymmetric Bajraktarevi&#x107, means;The purpose of this paper is to investigate the invariance of the arithmetic mean with respect to two weighted Bajraktarevi\'c means, i.e., to solve the functional equation $$ <br />\bigg(\frac{f}{g}\bigg)^{\!\!-1}\!\!\bigg(\frac{tf(x)+sf(y)}{tg(x)+sg(y)}\bigg) <br />+\bigg(\frac{h}{k}\bigg)^{\!\!-1}\!\!\bigg(\frac{sh(x)+th(y)}{sk(x)+tk(y)}\bigg)=x+y \qquad(x,y\in I), $$ where $f,g,h,k:I\to\mathbb{R}$ are unknown continuous functions such that $g,k$ are nowhere zero on $I$, the ratio functions $f/g$, $h/k$ are strictly monotone on $I$, and $t,s\in\mathbb{R}_+$ are constants different from each other. By the main result of this paper, the solutions of the above invariance equation can be expressed either in terms of hyperbolic functions or in terms of trigonometric functions and an additional weight function. For the necessity part of this result, we will assume that $f,g,h,k:I\to\mathbb{R}$ are four times continuously differentiable.;math.CA
1801.00990;A two-stage fourth order time-accurate discretization for Lax--Wendroff type flow solvers II. High order numerical boundary conditions;This paper serves to treat boundary conditions numerically with high order accuracy in order to match the two-stage fourth-order finite volume schemes for hyperbolic problems developed in [{\em J. Li and Z. Du, A two-stage fourth order time-accurate discretization {L}ax--{W}endroff type flow solvers, {I}. {H}yperbolic conservation laws, SIAM, J. Sci. Comput., 38 (2016), pp.~A3046--A3069}]. As such, it is significant when capturing small scale structures near physical boundaries. Different from previous contributions in literature, the current approach constructs a fourth order accurate approximation to boundary conditions by only using the Jacobian of the flux function (characteristic information) instead of its successive differentiation leading to tensors of high ranks in the inverse Lax-Wendroff method. Technically, data in several ghost cells are constructed with interpolation so that the interior scheme can be implemented over boundary cells, and theoretical boundary condition has to be modified properly at intermediate stages so as to make the two-stage scheme over boundary cells fully consistent with that over interior cells. This highlights the fact that {\em continuous boundary conditions only match continuous partial differential equations (PDEs), and they must be approximated in a consistent way (even though it could be exactly valued) when the PDEs are discretized.} Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the current approach when dealing with general boundary conditions.;math.NA
1801.00992;The Capacity on Degraded Relay Broadcast Channel;The relay broadcast channel (RBC) is considered, in which a transmitter communicates with two receivers with the assistance of a relay. Based on different degradation orders among the relay and the receivers' outputs, three types of physically degraded RBCs (PDRBCs) are introduced. Inner bounds and outer bounds are derived on the capacity region of the presented three types. The bounds are tight for two types of PDRBCs: 1) one receiver's output is a degraded form of the other receiver's output, and the relay's output is a degraded form of the weaker receiver's output, 2) one receiver's output is a degraded form of the relay's output, and the other receiver's output is a degraded form of the relay's output. For the Gaussian PDRBC, the bounds match, i.e., establish its capacity region.;cs.IT
1801.01006;The risk model with stochastic premiums, dependence and a threshold dividend strategy;The paper deals with a generalization of the risk model with stochastic premiums where dependence structures between claim sizes and inter-claim times as well as premium sizes and inter-premium times are modeled by Farlie--Gumbel--Morgenstern copulas. In addition, dividends are paid to its shareholders according to a threshold dividend strategy. We derive integral and integro-differential equations for the Gerber--Shiu function and the expected discounted dividend payments until ruin. Next, we concentrate on the detailed investigation of the model in the case of exponentially distributed claim and premium sizes. In particular, we find explicit formulas for the ruin probability in the model without either dividend payments or dependence as well as for the expected discounted dividend payments in the model without dependence. Finally, numerical illustrations are presented.;math.PR
1801.01007;A Comprehensive Bayesian Treatment of the Universal Kriging model with Mat&#xe9,rn correlation kernels;The Gibbs reference posterior distribution provides an objective full-Bayesian solution to the problem of prediction of a stationary Gaussian process with Mat\'ern anisotropic kernel. A full-Bayesian approach is possible, because the posterior distribution is expressed as the invariant distribution of a uniformly ergodic Markovian kernel for which we give an explicit expression. In this paper, we show that it is appropriate for the Universal Kriging framework, that is when an unknown function is added to the stationary Gaussian process. We give sufficient conditions for the existence and propriety of the Gibbs reference posterior that apply to a wide variety of practical cases and illustrate the method with several examples. Finally, simulations of Gaussian processes suggest that the Gibbs reference posterior has good frequentist properties in terms of coverage of prediction intervals.;math.ST

1801.01014;Finite asymptotic clusters of metric spaces;Let $(X, d)$ be an unbounded metric space and let $\tilde r=(r_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}$ be a sequence of positive real numbers tending to infinity. A pretangent space $\Omega_{\infty, \tilde r}^{X}$ to $(X, d)$ at infinity is a limit of the rescaling sequence $\left(X, \frac{1}{r_n}d\right).$ The set of all pretangent spaces $\Omega_{\infty, \tilde r}^{X}$ is called an asymptotic cluster of pretangent spaces. Such a cluster can be considered as a weighted graph $(G_{X, \tilde r}, \rho_{X})$ whose maximal cliques coincide with $\Omega_{\infty, \tilde r}^{X}$ and the weight $\rho_{X}$ is defined by metrics on $\Omega_{\infty, \tilde r}^{X}$. We describe the structure of metric spaces having finite asymptotic clusters of pretangent spaces and characterize the finite weighted graphs which are isomorphic to these clusters.;math.MG

1801.01022;Shannon Capacity is Achievable for Binary Interactive First-Order Markovian Protocols;We address the problem of simulating an arbitrary binary interactive first-order Markovian protocol over a pair of binary symmetric channels with crossover probability $\varepsilon$. We are interested in the achievable rates of reliable simulation, i.e., in characterizing the smallest possible blowup in communications such that a vanishing error probability (in the protocol length) can be attained. Whereas for general interactive protocols the output of each party may depend on all previous outputs of its counterpart, in a (first-order) Markovian protocol this dependence is limited to the last observed output only. Previous works in the field discuss broader families of protocols but assess the achievable rates only at the limit where $\varepsilon\to0$. <br />In this paper, we prove that the one-way Shannon capacity, $1-h(\varepsilon)$, can be achieved for any binary first-order Markovian protocol. This surprising result, is to the best of our knowledge, the first example in which non-trivial interactive protocol can be simulated in the Shannon capacity. We give two capacity achieving coding schemes, which both divide the protocol into independent blocks, and implement vertical block coding. The first scheme is based on a random separation into blocks with variable lengths. The second scheme is based on a deterministic separation into blocks, and efficiently predicting their last transmission. The prediction can be regarded as a binary pointer jumping game, for which we show that the final step can be calculated with $O(\log m)$ bits, where $m$ is the number of rounds in the game. We conclude the work by discussing possible extensions of the result to higher order models.;cs.IT
1801.01023;Calder&#xf3,n-Zygmund operators on Zygmund spaces on domains;Given a bounded Lipschitz domain $D\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and a Calder\'on-Zygmund operator $T$, we study the relations between smoothness properties of $\partial D$ and the boundedness of $T$ on the Zydmund space $\mathcal{C}_{\omega}(D)$ defined for a general growth function $\omega$. In the proof we obtain a T(P) theorem for the Zygmund spaces, when one checks boundedness not only of the characteristic function, but a finite collection of polynomials restricted to the domain. Also, a new form of extra cancellation property of the even Calder\'on-Zygmund operators in polynomial domains is stated.;math.FA

We also establish an optimal rate of density for the values of polynomials maps in a number of other natural problems, including the values of linear forms restricted to suitable quadratic surfaces, and the values of the polynomial map defined by the generators of the ring of conjugation-invariant polynomials on $M_3(\C)$. <br />These results are instances of a general approach that we develop, which considers a rational affine algebraic subvariety of Euclidean space, invariant and homogeneous under an action of a semisimple Lie group $G$. Given a polynomial map $F$ defined on the Euclidean space which is invariant under a semisimple subgroup $H$ of the acting group $G$, consider the family of its translates $F\circ g$ by elements of the group. We study the restriction of these polynomial functions to the integer points on the variety confined to a large Euclidean ball. Our main results establish an explicit rate of density for their values, for generic polynomials in the family. This problem has been extensively studied before when the polynomials in question are linear, in the context of classical Diophantine approximation, but very little was known about it for polynomial of higher degree. We formulate a heuristic pigeonhole lower bound for the density and an explicit upper bound for it, formulate a sufficient condition for the coincidence of the lower and upper bounds, and in a number of natural examples establish that they indeed match. Finally, we also establish a rate of density for values of homogeneous polynomials on homogeneous projective varieties.;math.NT

1801.01030;Dissipative measure valued solutions for general conservation laws;In the last years measure-valued solutions started to be considered as a relevant notion of solutions if they satisfy the so-called measure-valued -- strong uniqueness principle. This means that they coincide with a strong solution emanating from the same initial data if this strong solution exists. This property has been examined for many systems of mathematical physics, including incompressible and compressible Euler system, compressible Navier-Stokes system et al. and there are also some results concerning general hyperbolic systems. Our goal is to provide a unified framework for general systems, that would cover the most interesting cases of systems, and most importantly, we give examples of equations, for which the aspect of measure-valued -- strong uniqueness has not been considered before, like incompressible magentohydrodynamics and shallow water magnetohydrodynamics.;math.AP

1801.01047;On the exact maximum induced density of almost all graphs and their inducibility;Let $H$ be a graph on $h$ vertices. The number of induced copies of $H$ in a graph $G$ is denoted by $i_H(G)$. Let $i_H(n)$ denote the maximum of $i_H(G)$ taken over all graphs $G$ with $n$ vertices. <br />Let $f(n,h) = \Pi_{i}^h a_i$ where $\sum_{i=1}^h a_i = n$ and the $a_i$ are as equal as possible. Let $g(n,h) = f(n,h) + \sum_{i=1}^h g(a_i,h)$. It is proved that for almost all graphs $H$ on $h$ vertices it holds that $i_H(n)=g(n,h)$ for all $n \le 2^{\sqrt{h}}$. More precisely, we define an explicit graph property ${\cal P}_h$ which, when satisfied by $H$, guarantees that $i_H(n)=g(n,h)$ for all $n \le 2^{\sqrt{h}}$. It is proved, in particular, that a random graph on $h$ vertices satisfies ${\cal P}_h$ with probability $1-o_h(1)$. Furthermore, all extremal $n$-vertex graphs yielding $i_H(n)$ in the aforementioned range are determined. <br />We also prove a stability result. For $H \in {\cal P}_h$ and a graph $G$ with $n \le 2^{\sqrt{h}}$ vertices satisfying $i_H(G) \ge f(n,h)$, it must be that $G$ is obtained from a balanced blowup of $H$ by adding some edges inside the blowup parts. <br />The {\em inducibility} of $H$ is $i_H = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} i_H(n)/\binom{n}{h}$. It is known that $i_H \ge h!/(h^h-h)$ for all graphs $H$ and that a random graph $H$ satisfies almost surely that $i_H \le h^{3\log h}h!/(h^h-h)$. We improve upon this upper bound almost matching the lower bound. It is shown that a graph $H$ which satisfies ${\cal P}_h$ has $i_H =(1+O(h^{-h^{1/3}}))h!/(h^h-h)$.;math.CO
1801.01050;Information Bottleneck on General Alphabets;We prove rigorously a source coding theorem that can probably be considered folklore, a generalization to arbitrary alphabets of a problem motivated by the Information Bottleneck method.

The proof relies on the well established discrete case and showcases a technique for lifting discrete coding theorems to arbitrary alphabets.;cs.IT
1801.01055;Gaps between prime numbers and tensor rank of multiplication in finite fields;We present effective upper bounds on the symmetric bilinear complexity of multiplication in extensions of a base finite field Fp2 of prime square order, obtained by combining estimates on gaps between prime numbers together with an optimal construction of auxiliary divisors for multiplication algorithms by evaluation-interpolation on curves. Most of this material dates back to a 2011 unpublished work of the author, but it still provides the best results on this topic at the present time. <br />Then a few updates are given in order to take recent developments into account, including comparison with a similar work of Ballet and Zykin, generalization to classical bilinear complexity over Fp, and to short multiplication of polynomials, as well as a discussion of open questions on gaps between prime numbers or more generally values of certain arithmetic functions.;math.NT
1801.01056;A New HDG Method for Dirichlet Boundary Control of Convection Diffusion PDEs II: Low Regularity;In the first part of this work, we analyzed a Dirichlet boundary control problem for an elliptic convection diffusion PDE and proposed a new hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method to approximate the solution. For the case of a 2D polygonal domain, we also proved an optimal superlinear convergence rate for the control under certain assumptions on the domain and on the target state. In this work, we revisit the convergence analysis without these assumptions, in this case, the solution can have low regularity and we use a different analysis approach. We again prove an optimal convergence rate for the control, and present numerical results to illustrate the convergence theory.;math.NA
1801.01060;A strictly commutative model for the cochain algebra of a space;The commutative differential graded algebra $A_{\mathrm{PL}}(X)$ of polynomial forms on a simplicial set $X$ is a crucial tool in rational homotopy theory. In this note, we construct an integral version $A^{\mathcal{I}}(X)$ of $A_{\mathrm{PL}}(X)$. Our approach uses diagrams of chain complexes indexed by the category of finite sets and injections $\mathcal{I}$ to model $E_{\infty}$ differential graded algebras by strictly commutative objects, called commutative $\mathcal{I}$-dgas. We define a functor $A^{\mathcal{I}}$ from simplicial sets to commutative $\mathcal{I}$-dgas and show that it is a commutative lift of the usual cochain algebra functor. In particular, it gives rise to a new construction of the $E_{\infty}$ dga of cochains. <br />The functor $A^{\mathcal{I}}$ shares many properties of $A_{\mathrm{PL}}$, and can be viewed as a generalization of $A_{\mathrm{PL}}$ that works over arbitrary commutative ground rings. Working over the integers, a theorem by Mandell implies that $A^{\mathcal{I}}(X)$ determines the homotopy type of $X$ when $X$ is a nilpotent space of finite type.;math.AT
1801.01062;Construction of Algorithms for Parallel Addition;An algebraic number $\beta \in \mathbb{C}$ with no conjugate of modulus 1 can serve as the base of a numeration system $(\beta, \mathcal{A})$ with parallel addition, i.e., the sum of two operands represented in base $\beta$ with digits from $\mathcal{A}$ is calculated in constant time, irrespective of the length of the operands. In order to allow parallel addition, sufficient level of redundancy must be given to the alphabet $\mathcal{A}$. The complexity of parallel addition algorithm depends heavily on the size $\#\mathcal{A}$ of the alphabet: the bigger alphabet is considered, the lower complexity of the parallel addition algorithm may be reached, and vice versa. Here we aim to find parallel addition algorithms on alphabets of the minimal possible size, for a given base. As the complexity of these algorithms becomes quite huge in general, we introduce a so-called Extending Window Method (EWM) - in fact an algorithm to construct parallel addition algorithms. This method can be applied on bases $\beta$ which are expanding algebraic integers, i.e., $\beta$ whose all conjugates are greater than 1 in modulus. Convergence of the EWM is not guaranteed, nevertheless, we have developed tools for revealing non-convergence, and there is a number of successful applications. Firstly, the EWM provides the same parallel addition algorithms as were previously introduced by A. Avizienis, C.Y. Chow &amp, J.E. Robertson or B. Parhami for integer bases and alphabets. Then, by applying the EWM on selected complex bases $\beta$ with non-integer alphabets $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathbb{Z}[\beta]$, we obtain new results - parallel addition algorithms on alphabets of minimal possible size, which could not be found so far (manually). The EWM is helpful also in the case of block parallel addition.;math.NT
1801.01069;Theoretical links between universal and Bayesian compressed sensing algorithms;Quantized maximum a posteriori (Q-MAP) is a recently-proposed Bayesian compressed sensing algorithm that, given the source distribution, recovers $X^n$ from its linear measurements $Y^m=AX^n$, where $A\in R^{m\times n}$ denotes the known measurement matrix. On the other hand, Lagrangian minimum entropy pursuit (L-MEP) is a universal compressed sensing algorithm that aims at recovering $X^n$ from its linear measurements $Y^m=AX^n$, without having access to the source distribution. Both Q-MAP and L-MEP provably achieve the minimum required sampling rates, in noiseless cases where such fundamental limits are known. L-MEP is based on minimizing a cost function that consists of a linear combination of the conditional empirical entropy of a potential reconstruction vector and its corresponding measurement error. In this paper, using a first-order linear approximation of the conditional empirical entropy function, L-MEP is connected with Q-MAP. The established connection between L-MEP and Q-MAP leads to variants of Q-MAP which have the same asymptotic performance as Q-MAP in terms of their required sampling rates. Moreover, these variants suggest that Q-MAP is robust to small error in estimating the source distribution. This robustness is theoretically proven and the effect of a non-vanishing estimation error on the required sampling rate is characterized.;cs.IT
1801.01072;Randomized Linear Algebra Approaches to Estimate the Von Neumann Entropy of Density Matrices;Thevon Neumann entropy, named after John von Neumann, is an extension of the classical concept of entropy to the field of quantum mechanics. From a numerical perspective, von Neumann entropy can be computed simply by computing all eigenvalues of a density matrix, an operation that could be prohibitively expensive for large-scale density matrices. We present and analyze three randomized algorithms to approximate von Neumann entropy of {real} density matrices: our algorithms leverage recent developments in the Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra (RandNLA) literature, such as randomized trace estimators, provable bounds for the power method, and the use of random projections to approximate the eigenvalues of a matrix. All three algorithms come with provable accuracy guarantees and our experimental evaluations support our theoretical findings showing considerable speedup with small loss in accuracy.;cs.IT
1801.01074;Forcing large tight components in 3-graphs;Any $n$-vertex $3$-graph with minimum codegree at least $\lfloor n/3\rfloor$ must have a spanning tight component, but immediately below this threshold it is possible for no tight component to span more than $\lceil 2n/3\rceil$ vertices. Motivated by this observation, we ask which codegree forces a tight component of at least any given size. The corresponding function seems to have infinitely many discontinuities, but we provide upper and lower bounds, which asymptotically converge as the function nears the origin.;math.CO
1801.01079;Exact Calculation of the Mean-Square Error in the Method of Expansion of Iterated Ito Stochastic integrals Based on Generalized Multiple Fourier Series;The article is devoted to the developement of the method of expansion and mean-square approximation of iterated Ito stochastic integrals based on generalized multiple Fourier series converging in the sense of norm in the space $L_2([t, T]^k)$ ($k$ is the multiplicity of the iterated Ito stochastic integral). We obtain the exact and approximate expressions for the mean-square error of approximation of iterated Ito stochastic integrals of multiplicity $k$ ($k\in\mathbb{N}$) from the stochastic Taylor-Ito expansion in the framework of the mentioned method. As a result, we do not need to use redundant terms of expansions of iterated Ito stochastic integrals, that complicate the numerical methods for Ito stochastic differential equations. Moreover, we proved the convergence with propability 1 of the method of expansion of iterated Ito stochastic integrals based on generalized multiple Fourier series for the cases of multiple Fourier-Legendre series and multiple trigonometric Fourier series. The results of the article can be applied to the high-order strong numerical methods for Ito stochastic differential equations as well as non-commutative semilinear stochastic partial differential equations with multiplicative trace class noise (in accordance with the mean-square criterion of convergence).;math.PR
1801.01082;A first integrability result for Miquel dynamics;Miquel dynamics is a discrete-time dynamical system on the space of square-grid circle patterns. For biperiodic circle patterns with both periods equal to two, we show that the dynamics corresponds to translation on an elliptic curve, thus providing the first integrability result for this dynamics. The main tool is a geometric interpretation of the addition law on the normalization of binodal quartic curves.;math.DS

We also find the ratio between the determinant of the moment matrix corresponding to the multiple orthogonal polynomials and the determinant of the moment matrix from the original planar measure.;math-ph
1801.01088;Convergence rates of Forward--Douglas--Rachford splitting method;Over the past years, operator splitting methods have become ubiquitous for non-smooth optimization owing to their simplicity and efficiency. In this paper, we consider the Forward--Douglas--Rachford splitting method (FDR) [10,40], and study both global and local convergence rates of this method. For the global rate, we establish an $o(1/k)$ convergence rate in terms of a Bregman divergence suitably designed for the objective function. Moreover, when specializing to the case of Forward--Backward splitting method, we show that convergence rate of the objective function of the method is actually $o(1/k)$ for a large choice of the descent step-size. Then locally, based on the assumption that the non-smooth part of the optimization problem is partly smooth, we establish local linear convergence of the method. More precisely, we show that the sequence generated by FDR method first (i) identifies a smooth manifold in a finite number of iteration, and then (ii) enters a local linear convergence regime, which is for instance characterized in terms of the structure of the underlying active smooth manifold. To exemplify the usefulness of the obtained result, we consider several concrete numerical experiments arising from applicative fields including, for instance, signal/image processing, inverse problems and machine learning.;math.OC
1801.01091;Independence number of graphs with a prescribed number of cliques;We consider the following problem posed by Erdos in 1962. Suppose that $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph where the number of $s$-cliques in $G$ is $t$. How small can the independence number of $G$ be? Our main result suggests that for fixed $s$, the smallest possible independence number undergoes a transition at $t=n^{s/2+o(1)}$. <br />In the case of triangles ($s=3$) we obtain the following result which is sharp apart from constant factors and generalizes basic results in Ramsey theory: there exists $c&gt,0$ such that every $n$-vertex graph with $t$ triangles has independence number at least $$c \cdot \min\left\{ \sqrt {n \log n}\, , \, \frac{n}{t^{1/3}} \left(\log \frac{n}{ t^{1/3}}\right)^{2/3} \right\}.$$;math.CO

We show that in an appropriate limit $E_{kk}^{(n)} \sim 2\kern .3pt H^{k+1/2}$ independently of $n$, where $H \approx 1/9.28903$ is Halphen's constant. This is the same formula as for minimax approximation of $e^x$ on $(-\infty,0\kern .3pt]$.;math.NA

1801.01101;The Hilbert scheme of space curves sitting on a smooth surface containing a line;We continue the study of maximal families W of the Hilbert scheme, H(d,g)_{sc}, of smooth connected space curves whose general curve C lies on a smooth degree-s surface S containing a line. For s &gt, 3, we extend the two ranges where W is a unique irreducible (resp. generically smooth) component of H(d,g)_{sc}. In another range, close to the boarder of the nef cone, we describe for s=4 and 5 components W that are non-reduced, leaving open the non-reducedness of only 3 (resp. 2) families for s &gt, 5 (resp. s=5), thus making progress to recent results of Kleppe and Ottem in [28]. For s=3 we slightly extend previous results on a conjecture of non-reduced components, and in addition we show its existence in a subrange of the conjectured range.;math.AG
1801.01103;A low-rank projector-splitting integrator for the Vlasov--Poisson equation;Many problems encountered in plasma physics require a description by kinetic equations, which are posed in an up to six-dimensional phase space. A direct discretization of this phase space, often called the Eulerian approach, has many advantages but is extremely expensive from a computational point of view. In the present paper we propose a dynamical low-rank approximation to the Vlasov--Poisson equation, with time integration by a particular splitting method. This approximation is derived by constraining the dynamics to a manifold of low-rank functions via a tangent space projection and by splitting this projection into the subprojections from which it is built. This reduces a time step for the six- (or four-) dimensional Vlasov--Poisson equation to solving two systems of three- (or two-) dimensional advection equations over the time step, once in the position variables and once in the velocity variables, where the size of each system of advection equations is equal to the chosen rank. By a hierarchical dynamical low-rank approximation, a time step for the Vlasov--Poisson equation can be further reduced to a set of six (or four) systems of one-dimensional advection equations, where the size of each system of advection equations is still equal to the rank. The resulting systems of advection equations can then be solved by standard techniques such as semi-Lagrangian or spectral methods. Numerical simulations in two and four dimensions for linear Landau damping, for a two-stream instability and for a plasma echo problem highlight the favorable behavior of this numerical method and show that the proposed algorithm is able to drastically reduce the required computational effort.;math.NA
1801.01106;On certain edge-transitive bicirculants;A graph $\Gamma$ of even order is a bicirculant if it admits an automorphism with two orbits of equal length. Symmetry properties of bicirculants, for which at least one of the induced subgraphs on the two orbits of the corresponding semiregular automorphism is a cycle, have been studied, at least for the few smallest possible valences. For valences $3$, $4$ and $5$, where the corresponding bicirculants are called generalized Petersen graphs, Rose window graphs and Taba\v{c}jn graphs, respectively, all edge-transitive members have been classified. While there are only 7 edge-transitive generalized Petersen graphs and only 3 edge-transitive Taba\v{c}jn graphs, infinite families of edge-transitive Rose window graphs exist. The main theme of this paper is the question of the existence of such bicirculants for higher valences. It is proved that infinite families of edge-transitive examples of valence $6$ exist and among them infinitely many arc-transitive as well as infinitely many half-arc-transitive members are identified. Moreover, the classification of the ones of valence $6$ and girth $3$ is given. As a corollary, an infinite family of half-arc-transitive graphs of valence $6$ with universal reachability relation, which were thus far not known to exist, is obtained.;math.CO
1801.01109;Biderivations and commuting linear maps on Lie algebras;Let $L$ be a Lie algebra over a field of characteristic different from $2$. If $L$ is perfect and centerless, then every skew-symmetric biderivation $\delta:L\times L\to L$ is of the form $\delta(x,y)=\gamma([x,y])$ for all $x,y\in L$, where $\gamma\in{\rm Cent}(L)$, the centroid of $L$. Under a milder assumption that $[c,[L,L]]=\{0\}$ implies $c=0$, every commuting linear map from $L$ to $L$ lies in ${\rm Cent}(L)$. These two results are special cases of our main theorems which concern biderivations and commuting linear maps having their ranges in an $L$-module. We provide a variety of examples, some of them showing the necessity of our assumptions and some of them showing that our results cover several results from the literature.;math.RA

1801.01145;Vectorial Boolean functions and linear codes in the context of algebraic attacks;In this paper we study the relationship between vectorial (Boolean) functions and cyclic codes in the context of algebraic attacks. We first derive a direct link between the annihilators of a vectorial function (in univariate form) and certain $2^{n}$-ary cyclic codes (which we prove that they are LCD codes) extending results due to R{\o}njom and Helleseth. The knowledge of the minimum distance of those codes gives rise to a lower bound on the algebraic immunity of the associated vectorial function. Furthermore, we solve an open question raised by Mesnager and Cohen. We also present some properties of those cyclic codes (whose generator polynomials determined by vectorial functions) as well as their weight enumerator. In addition we generalize the so-called algebraic complement and study its properties.;cs.IT

1801.01149;Graph switching, 2-ranks, and graphical Hadamard matrices;We study the behaviour of the 2-rank of the adjacency matrix of a graph under Seidel and Godsil-McKay switching, and apply the result to graphs coming from graphical Hadamard matrices of order $4^m$. Starting with graphs from known Hadamard matrices of order $64$, we find (by computer) many Godsil-McKay switching sets that increase the 2-rank. Thus we find strongly regular graphs with parameters $(63,32,16,16)$, $(64,36,20,20)$, and $(64,28,12,12)$ for almost all feasible 2-ranks. In addition we work out the behaviour of the 2-rank for a graph product related to the Kronecker product for Hadamard matrices, which enables us to find many graphical Hadamard matrices of order $4^m$ for which the related strongly regular graphs have an unbounded number of different 2-ranks. The paper extends results from the article 'Switched symplectic graphs and their 2-ranks' by the first and the last author.;math.CO
1801.01161;Spherical bodies of constant width;The intersection $L$ of two different non-opposite hemispheres $G$ and $H$ of a $d$-dimensional sphere $S^d$ is called a lune. By the thickness of $L$ we mean the distance of the centers of the $(d-1)$-dimensional hemispheres bounding $L$. For a hemisphere $G$ supporting a %spherical convex body $C \subset S^d$ we define ${\rm width}_G(C)$ as the thickness of the narrowest lune or lunes of the form $G \cap H$ containing $C$. If ${\rm width}_G(C) =w$ for every hemisphere $G$ supporting $C$, we say that $C$ is a body of constant width $w$. We present properties of these bodies. In particular, we prove that the diameter of any spherical body $C$ of constant width $w$ on $S^d$ is $w$, and that if $w &lt, \frac{\pi}{2}$, then $C$ is strictly convex. Moreover, we are checking when spherical bodies of constant width and constant diameter coincide.;math.MG
1801.01165;Automorphism groups and Ramsey properties of sparse graphs;We study automorphism groups of sparse graphs from the viewpoint of topological dynamics and the Kechris, Pestov, Todor\v{c}evi\'c correspondence. We investigate amenable and extremely amenable subgroups of these groups using the space of orientations of the graph and results from structural Ramsey theory. Resolving one of the open questions in the area, we show that Hrushovski's example of an $\omega$-categorical sparse graph has no $\omega$-categorical expansion with extremely amenable automorphism group.;math.GR
1801.01167;Random Kleinian Groups, II : Two parabolic generators;In earlier work we introduced geometrically natural probability measures on the group of all M\"obius transformations in order to study "random" groups of M\"obius transformations, random surfaces, and in particular random two-generator groups, that is groups where the generators are selected randomly, with a view to estimating the likely-hood that such groups are discrete and then to make calculations of the expectation of their associated parameters, geometry and topology. In this paper we continue that study and identify the precise probability that a Fuchsian group generated by two parabolic M\"obius transformations is discrete, and give estimates for the case of Kleinian groups generated by a pair of random parabolic elements which we support with a computational investigation into of the Riley slice as identified by Bowditch's condition, and establish rigorous bounds.;math.CV
1801.01170;Optimization-based AMP for Phase Retrieval: The Impact of Initialization and $\ell_2$-regularization;We consider an $\ell_2$-regularized non-convex optimization problem for recovering signals from their noisy phaseless observations. We design and study the performance of a message passing algorithm that aims to solve this optimization problem. We consider the asymptotic setting $m,n \rightarrow \infty$, $m/n \rightarrow \delta$ and obtain sharp performance bounds, where $m$ is the number of measurements and $n$ is the signal dimension. We show that for complex signals the algorithm can perform accurate recovery with only $m= \left(\frac{64}{\pi^2}-4\right)n \approx 2.5n$ measurements. Also, we provide sharp analysis on the sensitivity of the algorithm to noise. We highlight the following facts about our message passing algorithm: (i) Adding $\ell_2$ regularization to the non-convex loss function can be beneficial. (ii) Spectral initialization has marginal impact on the performance of the algorithm. The sharp analyses in this paper, not only enable us to compare the performance of our method with other phase recovery schemes, but also shed light on designing better iterative algorithms for other non-convex optimization problems.;cs.IT
1801.01184;A note on the problem of prisoners and hats;We study the famous mathematical puzzle of prisoners and hats.

1801.01186;Explicit expression for a family of ternary cyclotomic polynomials;In this paper, we give an explicit expression for a certain family of ternary cyclotomic polynomials: specifically $\Phi_{p_{1}p_{2}p_{3}}$, where $p_{1}&lt,p_{2}&lt,p_{3}$ are odd primes such that $p_{2} \equiv1 \mod p_{1}$ and $p_{3} \equiv1 \mod {p_{1}p_{2}}$. As an application of the explicit expressions, we give an exact formula for the number of nonzero terms in the polynomials in the family, which in turn immediately shows that the density (number of non-zeros terms / degree) is roughly inversely proportional to $p_{2}$, when $p_{1}$ is sufficiently large.;math.NT
1801.01187;The geometry of Gauss map and shape operator in simply isotropic and pseudo-isotropic spaces;In this work, we are interested in the differential geometry of surfaces in simply isotropic $\mathbb{I}^3$ and pseudo-isotropic $\mathbb{I}_{\mathrm{p}}^3$ spaces, which consists of the study of $\mathbb{R}^3$ equipped with a degenerate metric such as $\mathrm{d}s^2=\mathrm{d}x^2\pm\mathrm{d}y^2$. The investigation is based on previous results in the simply isotropic space [B. Pavkovi\'c, Glas. Mat. Ser. III $\mathbf{15}$, 149 (1980), Rad JAZU $\mathbf{450}$, 129 (1990)], which point to the possibility of introducing an isotropic Gauss map taking values on a unit sphere of parabolic type and of defining a shape operator from it, whose determinant and trace give the known relative Gaussian and mean curvatures, respectively. Based on the isotropic Gauss map, a new notion of connection is also introduced, the \emph{relative connection} (\emph{r-connection}, for short). We show that the new curvature tensor in both $\mathbb{I}^3$ and $\mathbb{I}_{\mathrm{p}}^3$ does not vanish identically and is directly related to the relative Gaussian curvature. We also compute the Gauss and Codazzi-Mainardi equations for the $r$-connection and show that $r$-geodesics on spheres of parabolic type are obtained via intersections with planes passing through their center (focus). Finally, we show that admissible pseudo-isotropic surfaces are timelike and that their shape operator may fail to be diagonalizable, in analogy to Lorentzian geometry. We also prove that the only totally umbilical surfaces in $\mathbb{I}_{\mathrm{p}}^3$ are planes and spheres of parabolic type and that, in contrast to the $r$-connection, the curvature tensor associated with the isotropic Levi-Civita connection vanishes identically for $any$ pseudo-isotropic surface, as also happens in simply isotropic space.;math.DG
1801.01188;A new proof of Raynaud-Gruson&#x27,s flattening theorem;We give a new proof of Raynaud-Gruson's theorem regarding flattening by blow-ups. The proof is direct, by working directly on the inverse limit of admissible blow-ups, which is a valuative space similar to the classical Zariski-Riemann space. These valuative spaces are defined in a broader context and always have an analogous flattening property: this yields a generalization of Raynaud-Gruson's theorem.;math.AG
1801.01189;Hasse-Witt matrices, unit roots and period integrals;Motivated by the work of Candelas, de la Ossa and Rodriguez-Villegas [6], we study the relations between Hasse-Witt matrices and period integrals of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in both toric varieties and partial flag varieties. We prove a conjecture by Vlasenko [23] on higher Hasse-Witt matrices for toric hypersurfaces following Katz's method of local expansion [14, 15]. The higher Hasse-Witt matrices also have close relation with period integrals. The proof gives a way to pass from Katz's congruence relations in terms of expansion coefficients [15] to Dwork's congruence relations [8] about periods.;math.AG
1801.01194;Period integrals of local complete intersections and tautological systems;Tautological systems developed in [6],[7] are Picard-Fuchs type systems to study period integrals of complete intersections in Fano varieties. We generalize tautological systems to local complete intersections, which are zero loci of global sections of vector bundles over Fano varieties. In particular, we obtain similar criterion as [6, 7] about holonomicity and regularity of the system. We also prove solution rank formulas and geometric realizations of solutions following the work of hypersurfaces [5, 4].;math.AG
1801.01201;Concurrent Implicit Spectral Deferred Correction Scheme for Low-Mach Number Combustion with Detailed Chemistry;We present a parallel implicit-explicit time integration scheme for the advection-diffusion-reaction systems arising from the equations governing low-Mach number combustion with complex chemistry. Our strategy employs parallelization across the method to accelerate the serial Multi-Implicit Spectral Deferred Correction (MISDC) scheme used to couple the advection, diffusion, and reaction processes. In our approach, referred to as Concurrent Implicit Spectral Deferred Correction (CISDC), the diffusion solves and the reaction solves are performed concurrently by different processors. Our analysis shows that the proposed parallel scheme is stable for stiff problems and that the sweeps converge to the fixed-point solution at a faster rate than with serial MISDC. We present numerical examples to demonstrate that the new algorithm is high-order accurate in time, and achieves a parallel speedup compared to serial MISDC.;math.NA
1801.01206;Radial basis function collocation method for decoupled fractional Laplacian wave equations;Decoupled fractional Laplacian wave equation can describe the seismic wave propagation in attenuating media. Fourier pseudospectral implementations, which solve the equation in spatial frequency domain, are the only existing methods for solving the equation. For the earth media with curved boundaries, the pseudospectral methods could be less attractive to handle the irregular computational domains. In the paper, we propose a radial basis function collocation method that can easily tackle the irregular domain problems. Unlike the pseudospectral methods, the proposed method solves the equation in physical variable domain. The directional fractional Laplacian is chosen from varied definitions of fractional Laplacian. Particularly, the vector Gr\"unwald-Letnikov formula is employed to approximate fractional directional derivative of radial basis function. The convergence and stability of the method are numerically investigated by using the synthetic solution and the long-time simulations, respectively. The method's flexibility is studied by considering homogeneous and multi-layer media having regular and irregular geometric boundaries.;math.NA
1801.01208;Binary Extended Formulations;We analyze different ways of constructing binary extended formulations of mixed-integer problems with bounded integer variables and compare their relative strength with respect to split cuts. We show that among all binary extended formulations where each bounded integer variable is represented by a distinct collection of binary variables, what we call "unimodular" extended formulations are the strongest. We also compare the strength of some binary extended formulations from the literature. Finally, we study the behavior of branch-and-bound on such extended formulations and show that branching on the new binary variables leads to significantly smaller enumeration trees in some cases.;math.OC
1801.01216;Absolutely compatible pairs in a von Neumann algebra;Let $a,b$ be elements in a unital C$^*$-algebra with $0\leq a,b\leq 1$. The element $a$ is absolutely compatible with $b$ if $$\vert a - b \vert + \vert 1 - a - b \vert = 1.$$ In this note we find some technical characterizations of absolutely compatible pairs in an arbitrary von Neumann algebra. These characterizations are applied to measure how close is a pair of absolute compatible positive elements in the closed unit ball from being orthogonal or commutative. In the case of 2 by 2 matrices the results offer a geometric interpretation in terms of an ellipsoid determined by one of the points. The conclusions for 2 by 2 matrices are also applied to describe absolutely compatible pairs of positive elements in the closed unit ball of $\mathbb{M}_n$.;math.OA
1801.01219;The distribution of overlaps between eigenvectors of Ginibre matrices;We study the overlaps between eigenvectors of nonnormal matrices. They quantify the stability of the spectrum, and characterize the joint eigenvalues increments under Dyson-type dynamics. Well known work by Chalker and Mehlig calculated the expectation of these overlaps for complex Ginibre matrices. For the same model, we extend their results by deriving the distribution of diagonal overlaps (the condition numbers), and their correlations. We prove: <br />(i) convergence of condition numbers for bulk eigenvalues to an inverse Gamma distribution, more generally, we decompose the quenched overlap (i.e. conditioned on eigenvalues) as a product of independent random variables, <br />(ii) asymptotic expectation of off-diagonal overlaps, both for microscopic or mesoscopic separation of the corresponding eigenvalues, <br />(iii) decorrelation of condition numbers associated to eigenvalues at mesoscopic distance, at polynomial speed in the dimension, <br />(iv) second moment asymptotics to identify the fluctuations order for off-diagonal overlaps, when the related eigenvalues are separated by any mesoscopic scale, <br />(v) a new formula for the correlation between overlaps for eigenvalues at microscopic distance, both diagonal and off-diagonal. <br />These results imply estimates on the extreme condition numbers, the volume of the pseudospectrum and the diffusive evolution of eigenvalues under Dyson-type dynamics, at equilibrium.;math.PR
1801.01221;Bounded-Velocity Stochastic Control for Dynamic Resource Allocation;We consider a general class of dynamic resource allocation problems within a stochastic optimal control framework. This class of problems arises in a wide variety of applications, each of which intrinsically involves resources of different types and demand with uncertainty and/or variability. The goal involves dynamically allocating capacity for every resource type in order to serve the uncertain/variable demand, modeled as Brownian motion, and maximize the discounted expected net-benefit over an infinite time horizon based on the rewards and costs associated with the different resource types, subject to flexibility constraints on the rate of change of each type of resource capacity. We derive the optimal control policy within a bounded-velocity stochastic control setting, which includes efficient and easily implementable algorithms for governing the dynamic adjustments to resource allocation capacities over time. Computational experiments investigate various issues of both theoretical and practical interest, quantifying the benefits of our approach over recent alternative optimization approaches.;math.OC

1801.01236;Multistep Neural Networks for Data-driven Discovery of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems;The process of transforming observed data into predictive mathematical models of the physical world has always been paramount in science and engineering. Although data is currently being collected at an ever-increasing pace, devising meaningful models out of such observations in an automated fashion still remains an open problem. In this work, we put forth a machine learning approach for identifying nonlinear dynamical systems from data. Specifically, we blend classical tools from numerical analysis, namely the multi-step time-stepping schemes, with powerful nonlinear function approximators, namely deep neural networks, to distill the mechanisms that govern the evolution of a given data-set. We test the effectiveness of our approach for several benchmark problems involving the identification of complex, nonlinear and chaotic dynamics, and we demonstrate how this allows us to accurately learn the dynamics, forecast future states, and identify basins of attraction. In particular, we study the Lorenz system, the fluid flow behind a cylinder, the Hopf bifurcation, and the Glycoltic oscillator model as an example of complicated nonlinear dynamics typical of biological systems.;math.DS
1801.01238;Topological Entropy for Discontinuous Semiflows;We study two variations of Bowen's definitions of topological entropy based on separated and spanning sets which can be applied to the study of discontinuous semiflows on compact metric spaces. We prove that these definitions reduce to Bowen's ones in the case of continuous semiflows. As a second result, we prove that our entropies give a lower bound for the $\tau$-entropy defined by Alves, Carvalho and V\'asquez (2015). Finally, we prove that for impulsive semiflows satisfying certain regularity condition, there exists a continuous semiflow defined on another compact metric space which is related to the first one by a semiconjugation, and whose topological entropy equals our extended notion of topological entropy by using separated sets for the original semiflow.;math.DS
1801.01240;The distance to square-free polynomials;In this paper, we consider a variant of Tur\'an's problem on the distance from an integer polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ to the nea\-rest irreducible polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$. We prove that for any polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$, there exist infinitely many square-free polynomials $g\in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ such that $L(f-g) \le 2$, where $L(f-g)$ denotes the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of $f-g$. On the other hand, we show that this inequality cannot be replaced by $L(f-g) \le 1$. For this, for each integer $d \geq 16$ we construct infinitely many polynomials $f \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ of degree $d$ such that neither $f$ itself nor any $f(x) \pm x^k$, where $k$ is a non-negative integer, is square-free. Polynomials over prime fields and their distances to square-free polynomials are also considered.;math.NT
1801.01241;On the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in presence of a background shear;In this note we revisit the classical subject of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in presence of an incompressible background shear flow. We derive a formula for the essential spectral radius of the evolution group generated by the linearization near the steady state and reveal that the velocity variations neutralize shortwave instabilities. The formula is a direct generalization of the result of H. J. Hwang and Y. Guo in the hydrostatic case \cite{HG}. Furthermore, we construct a class of steady states which posses unstable discrete spectrum with neutral essential spectrum. The technique involves the WKB analysis of the evolution equation and contains novel compactness criterion for pseudo-differential operators on unbounded domains.;math.AP
1801.01249;Cooperative Ambient Backscatter Communications for Green Internet-of-Things;Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables a passive backscatter device to transmit information to a reader using ambient RF signals, and has emerged as a promising solution to green Internet-of-Things (IoT). Conventional AmBC receivers are interested in recovering the information from the ambient backscatter device (A-BD) only. In this paper, we propose a cooperative AmBC (CABC) system in which the reader recovers information not only from the A-BD, but also from the RF source. We first establish the system model for the CABC system from spread spectrum and spectrum sharing perspectives. Then, for flat fading channels, we derive the optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) detector, suboptimal linear detectors as well as successive interference-cancellation (SIC) based detectors. For frequency-selective fading channels, the system model for the CABC system over ambient orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) carriers is proposed, upon which a low-complexity optimal ML detector is derived. For both kinds of channels, the bit-error-rate (BER) expressions for the proposed detectors are derived in closed forms. Finally, extensive numerical results have shown that, when the A-BD signal and the RF-source signal have equal symbol period, the proposed SIC-based detectors can achieve near-ML detection performance for typical application scenarios, and when the A-BD symbol period is longer than the RF-source symbol period, the existence of backscattered signal in the CABC system can enhance the ML detection performance of the RF-source signal, thanks to the beneficial effect of the backscatter link when the A-BD transmits at a lower rate than the RF source.;cs.IT
1801.01251;Period integral of open Fermat surfaces and special values of hypergeometric functions;In the previous paper by Asakura-Otsubo-Terasoma, we prove that the special values of the hypergeometric function 3F2 at 1 are linear combinations of logarithms of algebraic numbers and 1 over algebraic numbers, if exponents are rational numbers satisfying a certain arithmetic condition. Aoki and Shioda completely classified these sets of rational numbers satisfying this condition in connection with Hodge cycles on Fermat surfaces. In this paper, we give an explicit expression of special values of hypergoemetricy 3F2 which does not belong to exceptional characters.;math.AG
1801.01252;A linearized energy preserving finite element method for the dynamical incompressible magnetohydrodynamics equations;We present and analyze a linearized finite element method (FEM) for the dynamical incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The finite element approximation is based on mixed conforming elements, where Taylor--Hood type elements are used for the Navier--Stokes equations and Nedelec edge elements are used for the magnetic equation. The divergence free conditions are weakly satisfied at the discrete level. Due to the use of Nedelec edge element, the proposed method is particularly suitable for problems defined on non-smooth and multi-connected domains. For the temporal discretization, we use a linearized scheme which only needs to solve a linear system at each time step. Moreover, the linearized mixed FEM is energy preserving. We establish an optimal error estimate under a very low assumption on the exact solutions and domain geometries. Numerical results which includes a benchmark lid-driven cavity problem are provided to show its effectiveness and verify the theoretical analysis.;math.NA
1801.01256;A scaling limit from the wave map to the heat flow into $\mathbb{S}^2$;In this paper we study a limit connecting a scaled wave map with the heat flow into the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$. We show quantitatively how that the two equations are connected by means of an initial layer correction. This limit is motivated as a first step into understanding the limit of zero inertia for the hyperbolic-parabolic Ericksen-Leslie's liquid crystal model.;math.AP
1801.01265;Improved Bounds on Lossless Source Coding and Guessing Moments via R&#xe9,nyi Measures;This paper provides upper and lower bounds on the optimal guessing moments of a random variable taking values on a finite set when side information may be available. These moments quantify the number of guesses required for correctly identifying the unknown object and, similarly to Arikan's bounds, they are expressed in terms of the Arimoto-R\'enyi conditional entropy. Although Arikan's bounds are asymptotically tight, the improvement of the bounds in this paper is significant in the non-asymptotic regime. Relationships between moments of the optimal guessing function and the MAP error probability are also established, characterizing the exact locus of their attainable values. The bounds on optimal guessing moments serve to improve non-asymptotic bounds on the cumulant generating function of the codeword lengths for fixed-to-variable optimal lossless source coding without prefix constraints. Non-asymptotic bounds on the reliability function of discrete memoryless sources are derived as well. Relying on these techniques, lower bounds on the cumulant generating function of the codeword lengths are derived, by means of the smooth R\'enyi entropy, for source codes that allow decoding errors.;cs.IT
1801.01268;Asymptotic Faithfulness of Quantum $\mathrm{Sp}(4)$ Mapping Class Group Representations;We prove asymptotic faithfulness for the quantum $\mathrm{Sp}(4)$ mapping class group representation. This provides the first example of asymptotic faithfulness lying outside of the $A_n$ family. The methods used are generalized from the proof of asymptotic faithfulness for skein $SU(2)_k$ mapping class group representations. In short, for any noncentral mapping class a comparison vector is found which allows for the mapping class to be detected.;math.QA
1801.01270;Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Wireless Communication: Tail, Risk and Scale;Ensuring ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) for 5G wireless networks and beyond is of capital importance and is currently receiving tremendous attention in academia and industry. At its core, URLLC mandates a departure from expected utility-based network design approaches, in which relying on average quantities (e.g., average throughput, average delay and average response time) is no longer an option but a necessity. Instead, a principled and scalable framework which takes into account delay, reliability, packet size, network architecture, and topology (across access, edge, and core) and decision-making under uncertainty is sorely lacking. The overarching goal of this article is a first step to fill this void. Towards this vision, after providing definitions of latency and reliability, we closely examine various enablers of URLLC and their inherent tradeoffs. Subsequently, we focus our attention on a plethora of techniques and methodologies pertaining to the requirements of ultra-reliable and low-latency communication, as well as their applications through selected use cases. These results provide crisp insights for the design of low-latency and high-reliable wireless networks.;cs.IT
1801.01271;On division subrings normalized by almost subnormal subgroups in division rings;Let $D$ be a division ring with infinite center, $K$ a proper division subring of $D$ and $N$ an almost subnormal subgroup of the multiplicative group $D^*$ of $D$. The aim of this paper is to show that if $K$ is $N$-invariant and $N$ is non-central, then $K$ is central. Some examples of almost subnormal subgroups in division rings that are not subnormal are also given.;math.RA
1801.01282;Minimal convex majorants of functions and Demyanov--Rubinov super(sub)differentials;The primary goal of the paper is to establish characteristic properties of (extended) real-valued functions defined on normed vector spaces that admit the representation as the lower envelope of their minimal (with respect to pointwise ordering) convex majorants. The results presented in the paper generalize and extend the well-known Demyanov-Rubinov characterization of upper semicontinuous positively homogeneous functions as the lower envelope of exhaustive families of continuous sublinear functions to more larger classes of (not necessarily positively homogeneous) functions defined on arbitrary normed spaces. As applications of the above results, we introduce, for nonsmooth functions, a new notion of the Demyanov-Rubinov subdifferential at a given point, and show that it generalizes a number of known notions of subdifferentiability, in particular, the Fenchel-Moreau subdifferential of convex functions and the Dini-Hadamard (directional) subdifferential of directionally differentiable functions. Some applications of Demyanov-Rubinov subdifferentials to extremal problems are considered.;math.OC
1801.01283;Recursive combinatorial aspects of compactified moduli spaces;A connection between moduli spaces of algebro-geometric objects and moduli spaces of polyhedral objects has been under investigation in recent years. Loosely speaking, the skeleton of an algebro-geometric moduli space is expressed as the modul space of the skeleta of the objects it parametrizes. The connection is based on the combinatorial properties of the boundary of the algebro-geometric moduli spaces. This paper overviews this topic with focus on moduli of curves, admissible covers, Jacobians and their Neron models.;math.AG
1801.01284;Ergodic BSDE with an unbounded and multiplicative underlying diffusion and application to large time behavior of viscosity solution of HJB equation;In this paper, we study ergodic backward stochastic differential equations (EBSDEs for short), for which the underlying diffusion is assumed to be multiplicative and of at most linear growth. The fact that the forward process has an unbounded diffusion is balanced with an assumption of weak dissipativity for its drift. Moreover, the forward equation is assumed to be non-degenerate. Like in [HMR15], we show that the solution of a BSDE in finite horizon T behaves basically as a linear function of T, with a shift depending on the solution of the associated EBSDE, with an explicit rate of convergence. Finally, we apply our results to an ergodic optimal control problem. In particular, we show the large time behaviour of viscosity solution of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation with an exponential rate of convergence when the undelrying diffusion is multiplicative and unbounded.;math.PR
1801.01289;On sums of squares of $|&#x3b6,(\frac12+i&#x3b3,)|$ over short intervals;A discussion involving the evaluation of the sum $$\sum_{T&lt,\g\le T+H}|\zeta(1/2+i\gamma)|^2$$ and some related integrals is presented, where $\gamma\,(&gt,0)$ denotes imaginary parts of complex zeros of the Riemann zeta-function $\zeta(s)$. It is shown unconditionally that the above sum is $\,\ll H\log^2T\log\log T\,$ for $\,T^{2/3}\log^4T \ll H \le T$.;math.NT
1801.01292;Generic distance-squared mappings on plane curves;A distance-squared function is one of the most significant functions in the application of singularity theory to differential geometry. Moreover, distance-squared mappings are naturally extended mappings of distance-squared functions, wherein each component is a distance-squared function. In this paper, compositions of a given plane curve and generic distance-squared mappings on the plane into the plane are investigated from the viewpoint of stability.;math.DG
1801.01297;Another refinement of the right-hand side of the Hermite-Hadamard inequality for simplices;In this paper, we establish a new refinement of the right-hand side of Hermite-Hadamard inequality for convex functions of several variables defined on simplices.;math.CA
1801.01300;Heat and entropy flows in Carnot groups;We prove the correspondence between the solutions of the sub-elliptic heat equation in a Carnot group $\mathbb{G}$ and the gradient flows of the relative entropy functional in the Wasserstein space of probability measures on $\mathbb{G}$. Our result completely answers a question left open in a previous paper by N. Juillet, where the same correspondence was proved for $\mathbb{G}=\mathbb{H}^n$, the $n$-dimensional Heisenberg group.;math.DG
1801.01302;Isoperimetric rigidity and distributions of 1-Lipschitz functions;We prove that if a geodesic metric measure space satisfies a comparison condition for isoperimetric profile and if the observable variance is maximal, then the space is foliated by minimal geodesics, where the observable variance is defined to be the supremum of the variance of 1-Lipschitz functions on the space. Our result can be considered as a variant of Cheeger-Gromoll's splitting theorem and also of Cheng's maximal diameter theorem. As an application, we obtain a new isometric splitting theorem for a complete weighted Riemannian manifold with a positive Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature.;math.MG
1801.01309;The mathematics of asymptotic stability in the Kuramoto model;Now a standard in Nonlinear Sciences, the Kuramoto model is the perfect example of the transition to synchrony in heterogeneous systems of coupled oscillators. While its basic phenomenology has been sketched in early works, the corresponding rigorous validation has long remained problematic and was achieved only recently. This paper reviews the mathematical results on asymptotic stability of stationary solutions in the continuum limit of the Kuramoto model, and provides insights into the principal arguments of proofs. This review is complemented with additional original results, various examples, and possible extensions to some variations of the model in the literature.;math.AP
1801.01310;Validity of Borodin and Kostochka Conjecture for {4 Times K1}-free Graphs;Problem of finding an optimal upper bound for the chromatic no. of even 3K1-free graphs is still open and pretty hard. Here we prove Borodin &amp, Kostochka Conjecture for 4K1-free graphs G i.e. If maximum degree of a {4 Times K1}-free graph is greater than or equal to 9, then the chromatic number of the graph is less than or equal to maximum of {\omega} and {\delta-1}.;math.CO
1801.01313;Thinplate Splines on the Sphere;In this paper we give explicit closed forms for the semi-reproducing kernels associated with thinplate spline interpolation on the sphere. Polyharmonic or thinplate splines for ${\mathbb R}^d$ were introduced by Duchon and have become a widely used tool in myriad applications. The analogues for ${\mathbb S}^{d-1}$ are the thin plate splines for the sphere. The topic was first discussed by Wahba in the early 1980's, for the ${\mathbb S}^2$ case. Wahba presented the associated semi-reproducing kernels as infinite series. These semi-reproducing kernels play a central role in expressions for the solution of the associated spline interpolation and smoothing problems. The main aims of the current paper are to give a recurrence for the semi-reproducing kernels, and also to use the recurrence to obtain explicit closed form expressions for many of these kernels. The closed form expressions will in many cases be significantly faster to evaluate than the series expansions. This will enhance the practicality of using these thinplate splines for the sphere in computations.;math.CA
1801.01318;S-regular functions which preserve a complex slice;We study global properties of quaternionic slice regular functions (also called s-regular) defined on symmetric slice domains. In particular, thanks to new techniques and points of view, we can characterize the property of being one-slice preserving in terms of the projectivization of the vectorial part of the function. We also define a "Hermitian" product on slice regular functions which gives us the possibility to express the $*$-product of two s-regular functions in terms of the scalar product of suitable functions constructed starting from $f$ and $g$. Afterwards we are able to determine, under different assumptions, when the sum, the $*$-product and the $*$-conjugation of two slice regular functions preserve a complex slice. We also study when the $*$-power of a slice regular function has this property or when it preserves all complex slices. To obtain these results we prove two factorization theorems: in the first one, we are able to split a slice regular function into the product of two functions: one keeping track of the zeroes and the other which is never-vanishing, in the other one we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a slice regular function (which preserves all complex slices) to be the symmetrized of a suitable slice regular one.;math.CV
1801.01327;Frobenius Theorem in Banach Space;Let $\Lambda$ be an open set in Banach space $E$, $M(x)$ for $x\in \Lambda$ a subspace in $E$, and $\mathcal F=\{M(x)\}_{x\in\Lambda}$. In this paper, we introduce the concept of the co-final set $J(x_0,E_*)$ for $\mathcal F$ at $x_0\in \Lambda$, then prove Frobenius theorem in Banach space where especially, $\mathrm{dim}\, M(x)$ maybe $\infty$. Using the Frobenius theorem, we prove a theorem in advanced calulus that presents several $c^1$ integrable family $\mathcal F$ at a point with $\mathrm{dim}\, M(x) =\infty$ and trivial co-final set. Let $\Lambda=B(E,F)\setminus\{0\},\ M(X)=\{T\in B(E,F) : TN(X)\subset R(X)\}$, and $\mathcal F=\{M(X)\}_{X\in\Lambda}$. The following theorem is proved using Frobenius theorem: if $A\in\Lambda$ is double splitting, then $\mathcal F$ at $A$ is smooth integrable where $J(A,E_*)$ is non-trivial in general. Specially we have the global result as follows, let $\Phi$ be any one of $F_k(k&lt,\infty)$ and $\Phi_{m,n}(\min\{m,n\}&lt,\infty)$, then $\Phi$ is smooth submanifold in $B(E,F)$ and tangent to $M(X)$ at any $X$ in $\Phi$.;math.FA
1801.01328;Schurity and separability of quasiregular coherent configurations;A permutation group is said to be quasiregular if every its transitive constituent is regular, and a quasiregular coherent configuration can be thought as a combinatorial analog of such a group: the transitive constituents are replaced by the homogeneous components. In this paper, we are interested in the question when the configuration is schurian, i.e., formed by the orbitals of a permutation group, or/and separable, i.e., uniquely determined by the intersection numbers. In these terms, an old result of Hanna Neumann is, in a sense, dual to the statement that the quasiregular coherent configurations with cyclic homogeneous components are schurian. In the present paper, we (a) establish the duality in a precise form and (b) generalize the latter result by proving that a quasiregular coherent configuration is schurian and separable if the groups associated with homogeneous components have distributive lattices of normal subgroups.;math.CO
1801.01329;Bounded normal generation is not equivalent to topological bounded normal generation;We show that some derived $\mathrm{L}^1$ full groups provide examples of non simple Polish groups with the topological bounded normal generation property. In particular, it follows that there are Polish groups with the topological bounded normal generation property but not the bounded normal generation property.;math.GR

1801.01336;A family of multigraphs with large palette index;Given a proper edge-coloring of a loopless multigraph, the palette of a vertex is defined as the set of colors of the edges which are incident with it. The palette index of a multigraph is defined as the minimum number of distinct palettes occurring among the vertices, taken over all proper edge-colorings of the multigraph itself. In this framework, the palette multigraph of an edge-colored multigraph is defined in this paper and some of its properties are investigated. We show that these properties can be applied in a natural way in order to produce the first known family of multigraphs whose palette index is expressed in terms of the maximum degree by a quadratic polynomial. We also attempt an analysis of our result in connection with some related questions.;math.CO
1801.01338;Quantitative aspects of the rigidity of branching microstructures in shape memory alloys via H-measures;We quantify the rigidity of branching microstructures in shape memory alloys undergoing cubic-to-tetragonal transformations in the geometrically linearized theory by making use of Tartar's H-measures. The main result is a $B^{2/3}_{1,\infty}$-estimate for the characteristic functions of twins, which heuristically suggests that the larger-scale interfaces can cluster on a set of Hausdorff-dimension $3-\frac{2}{3}$. We provide evidence indicating that the dimension is optimal. Furthermore, we get an essentially local lower bound for the blow-up behavior of the limiting energy density close to a habit plane.;math.AP
1801.01339;On the application of the Lindstedt-Poincar&#xe9, method to the Lotka-Volterra system;We apply the Lindstedt-Poincar\'{e} method to the Lotka-Volterra model and discuss alternative implementations of the approach. By means of an efficient systematic algorithm we obtain an unprecedented number of perturbation corrections for the two dynamical variables and the frequency. They enable us to estimate the radius of convergence of the perturbation series for the frequency as a function of the only model parameter. The method is suitable for the treatment of systems with any number of dynamical variables.;math-ph
1801.01340;Random time step probabilistic methods for uncertainty quantification in chaotic and geometric numerical integration;A novel probabilistic numerical method for quantifying the uncertainty induced by the time integration of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is introduced. Departing from the classical strategy to randomize ODE solvers by adding a random forcing term, we show that a probability measure over the numerical solution of ODEs can be obtained by introducing suitable random time-steps in a classical time integrator. This intrinsic randomization allows for the conservation of geometric properties of the underlying deterministic integrator such as mass conservation, symplecticity or conservation of first integrals. Weak and mean-square convergence analysis are derived. We also analyse the convergence of the Monte Carlo estimator for the proposed random time step method and show that the measure obtained with repeated sampling converges in the mean-square sense independently of the number of samples. Numerical examples including chaotic Hamiltonian systems, chemical reactions and Bayesian inferential problems illustrate the accuracy, robustness and versatility of our probabilistic numerical method.;math.NA
1801.01345;De Branges spaces and Fock spaces;Relations between two classes of Hilbert spaces of entire functions, de Branges spaces and Fock-type spaces with non-radial weights, are studied. It is shown that any de Branges space can be realized as a Fock-type space with equivalent area norm, and several constructions of a representing weight are suggested. For some special classes of weights (e.g., weights depending on the imaginary part only) the corresponding de Branges spaces are explicitly described.;math.CV
1801.01346;Spectral properties of 2D Pauli operators with almost periodic electromagnetic fields;We consider a 2D Pauli operator with almost periodic field $b$ and electric potential $V$. First, we study the ergodic properties of $H$ and show, in particular, that its discrete spectrum is empty if there exists a magnetic potential which generates the magnetic field $b - b_{0}$, $b_{0}$ being the mean value of $b$. Next, we assume that $V = 0$, and investigate the zero modes of $H$. As expected, if $b_{0} \neq 0$, then generically $\operatorname{dim} \operatorname{Ker} H = \infty$. If $b_{0} = 0$, then for each $m \in {\mathbb N} \cup \{ \infty \}$, we construct almost periodic $b$ such that $\operatorname{dim} \operatorname{Ker} H = m$. This construction depends strongly on results concerning the asymptotic behavior of Dirichlet series, also obtained in the present article.;math.SP
1801.01347;Metaplectic Eisenstein Distributions;In this paper, we define distributional analogues of the metaplectic Eisenstein series for $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$, which we refer to as metaplectic Eisenstein distributions. We prove that these distributions have meromorphic continuation and give an explicit functional equation that they satisfy. From these results, we deduce the functional equation for the corresponding classical metaplectic Eisenstein series.;math.NT
1801.01352;Two-phase heat conductors with a surface of the constant flow property;We consider a two-phase heat conductor in $\mathbb R^N$ with $N \geq 2$ consisting of a core and a shell with different constant conductivities. We study the role played by radial symmetry for overdetermined problems of elliptic and parabolic type. First of all, with the aid of the implicit function theorem, we give a counterexample to radial symmetry for some two-phase elliptic overdetermined boundary value problems of Serrin-type. Afterwards, we consider the following setting for a two-phase parabolic overdetermined problem. We suppose that, initially, the conductor has temperature 0 and, at all times, its boundary is kept at temperature 1. A hypersurface in the domain has the constant flow property if at every of its points the heat flux across surface only depends on time. It is shown that the structure of the conductor must be spherical, if either there is a surface of the constant flow property in the shell near the boundary or a connected component of the boundary of the heat conductor is a surface of the constant flow property. Also, by assuming that the medium outside the conductor has a possibly different conductivity, we consider a Cauchy problem in which the conductor has initial inside temperature $0$ and outside temperature $1$. We then show that a quite similar symmetry result holds true.;math.AP
1801.01354;Ekedahl-Oort stratifications of Shimura varieties via Breuil-Kisin windows;Let $ S $ be the special fibre of the good reduction of a Shimura variety of Hodge type. By constructing adapted deformations for the associated $p$-divisible groups of $ S $, we manage to construct a morphism from $S$ to some quotient sheaf of the loop group associated with $S$. We show that the geometric fibres of this morphism give back the Ekedahl-Oort strata of $S$. For any geometric point $ x $ of $ S $, we give a deformation over $ W(k(x)) $ of the $ p $-divisible group associated with $ x $ by (non-canonically) constructing a Breuil-Kisin window (which corresponds to a $ p $-divisible group over $ W(k(x)) $ by the work of Kisin). This map in a sense gives a conceptual interpretation of Viehmann's new invariants "truncations of level one of elements in the loop group".;math.AG
1801.01360;Minimal Representations of Natural Numbers Under a Set of Operators;This paper studies the minimal length representation of the natural numbers. Let O be a fixed set of integer-valued functions (primarily hyperoperations). For each n, what is the shortest way of expressing n as a combinations of functions in O to the constant 1? For example, if O contains the two functions Sx (successor of x) and *xy (x times y) then the shortest representation of 12 is *SSS1SS1, with 8 symbols. This is taken to mean that 8 is complexity of 12 under O. We make a study of such minimal representations and complexities in this paper, proving and/or rightly predicting bounds on complexities, discussing some relevant patterns in the complexities and minimal representations of the natural numbers and listing the results gleaned from computational analysis. Computationally, the first 4.5 million natural numbers were probed to verify our mathematically obtained results. Due to the finiteness of the problem, we used the method of exhaustion of possibilities to state some other results as well.;math.HO

In this paper, the author considers the complete continuity on weighted $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ spaces with $A_p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ weights, weighted Morrey spaces with $A_p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ weights, for the commutator generated by ${\rm CMO}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ functions and $\mathcal{M}_{\Omega}$ when $\Omega$ satisfies certain size conditions.;math.CA
1801.01368;A simple property of the Weyl tensor for a shear, vorticity and acceleration-free velocity field;We prove that, in a space-time of dimension n&gt,3 with a velocity field that is shear-free, vorticity-free and acceleration-free, the covariant divergence of the Weyl tensor is zero if the contraction of the Weyl tensor with the velocity is zero. The other way, if the covariant divergence of the Weyl tensor is zero, then the contraction of the Weyl tensor with the velocity has recurrent geodesic derivative. This partly extends a property found in Generalised Robertson-Walker spacetimes, where the velocity is also eigenvector of the Ricci tensor. Despite the simplicity of the statement, the proof is involved. As a product of the same calculation, we introduce a curvature tensor with an interesting recurrence property.;math-ph

1801.01380;The cost of controlling strongly degenerate parabolic equations;We consider the typical one-dimensional strongly degenerate parabolic operator $Pu= u_t - (x^\alpha u_x)_x$ with $0&lt,x&lt,\ell$ and $\alpha\in(0,2)$, controlled either by a boundary control acting at $x=\ell$, or by a locally distributed control. Our main goal is to study the dependence of the so-called controllability cost needed to drive an initial condition to rest with respect to the degeneracy parameter $\alpha$. We prove that the control cost blows up with an explicit exponential rate, as $e^{C/((2-\alpha)^2 T)}$, when $\alpha \to 2^-$ and/or $T\to 0^+$. <br />Our analysis builds on earlier results and methods (based on functional analysis and complex analysis techniques) developed by several authors such as Fattorini-Russel, Seidman, G\"uichal, Tenenbaum-Tucsnak and Lissy for the classical heat equation. In particular, we use the moment method and related constructions of suitable biorthogonal families, as well as new fine properties of the Bessel functions $J_\nu$ of large order $\nu$ (obtained by ordinary differential equations techniques).;math.OC
1801.01381;Graph Homologies and Functoriality;We follow the same technics we used before in \cite{AZ} of extending knot Floer homology to embedded graphs in a 3-manifold, by using the Kauffman topological invariant of embedded graphs by associating family of links and knots to a such graph by using some local replacements at each vertex in the graph. This new concept of Graph Floer homology constructed to be the sum of the knot Floer homologies of all the links and knots associated to this graph and the Euler characteristic is the sum of all the Alexander polynomials of links in the family. We constructed three pre-additive categories one for the graph under the cobordism and the other one is constructed in \cite{AMM} the last one is a category of Floer homologies for graph defined by Kauffman. Then we trying to study the functoriality of graphs category and their graph homologies in two ways, under cobordism and under branched cover, then we try to find the compatibility between them by the idea of Hilden and Little \cite{HL} by giving a notion of equivalence relation of branched coverings obtained by using cobordisms, and hence define a a functor from the graph Floer-Kauffman Homology category to the graph Khovanov-Kauffman Homology category.;math.AT
1801.01382;Logarithmic Bose-Einstein condensates with harmonic potential;In this paper, by using a compactness method, we study the Cauchy problem of the logarithmic Schr\"{o}dinger equation with harmonic potential. We then address the existence of ground states solutions as minimizers of the action on the Nehari manifold. Finally, we explicitly compute ground states (Gausson-type solution) and we show their orbital stability.;math.AP
1801.01384;Holomorphic Structure of Middle Bol Loops;A loop $(Q,\cdot,\backslash,/)$ is called a middle Bol loop if it obeys the identity $x(yz\backslash x)=(x/z)(y\backslash x)$. To every right (left) Bol loop corresponds a middle Bol loop via an isostrophism. In this paper, the structure of the holomorph of a middle Bol loop is explored. For some special types of automorphisms, the holomorph of a commutative loop is shown to be a commutative middle Bol loop if and only if the loop is a middle Bol loop and its automorphism group is abelian and a subgroup of both the group of middle regular mappings and the right multiplication group. It was found that commutativity (flexibility) is a necessary and sufficient condition for holomorphic invariance under the existing isostrophy between middle Bol loops and the corresponding right (left) Bol loops. The right combined holomorph of a middle Bol loop and its corresponding right (left) Bol loop was shown to be equal to the holomorph of the middle Bol loop if and only if the automorphism group is abelian and a subgroup of the multiplication group of the middle Bol loop. The obedience of an identity dependent on automorphisms was found to be a necessary and sufficient condition the left combined holomorph of a middle Bol loop and its corresponding left Bol loop to be equal to the holomorph of the middle Bol loop.;math.GR
1801.01386;On Enriched Fibrations;We introduce the notion of an enriched fibration, i.e. a fibration whose total category and base category are enriched in those of a monoidal fibration in an appropriate way. Furthermore, we provide a way to obtain such a structure, starting from actions of monoidal categories with parameterized adjoints. The motivating goal is to capture certain example cases, like the fibration of modules over algebras enriched in the opfibration of comodules over coalgebras.;math.CT
1801.01389;Bogoliubov Theory in the Gross-Pitaevskii Limit;We consider Bose gases consisting of $N$ particles trapped in a box with volume one and interacting through a repulsive potential with scattering length of the order $N^{-1}$(Gross-Pitaevskii regime). We determine the ground state energy and the low-energy excitation spectrum, up to errors vanishing as $N \to \infty$. Our results confirm Bogoliubov's predictions.;math-ph
1801.01392;Lebesgue type decompositions for linear relations and Ando&#x27,s uniqueness criterion;A linear relation, i.e., a multivalued operator $T$ from a Hilbert space ${\mathfrak H}$ to a Hilbert space ${\mathfrak K}$ has Lebesgue type decompositions $T=T_{1}+T_{2}$, where $T_{1}$ is a closable operator and $T_{2}$ is an operator or relation which is singular. There is one canonical decomposition, called the Lebesgue decomposition of $T$, whose closable part is characterized by its maximality among all closable parts in the sense of domination. All Lebesgue type decompositions are parametrized, which also leads to necessary and sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of such decompositions. Similar results are given for weak Lebesgue type decompositions, where $T_1$ is just an operator without being necessarily closable. Moreover, closability is characterized in different useful ways. In the special case of range space relations the above decompositions may be applied when dealing with pairs of (nonnegative) bounded operators and nonnegative forms as well as in the classical framework of positive measures.;math.FA
1801.01393;Codegree Tur&#xe1,n density of complete $r$-uniform hypergraphs;Let $r\ge 3$. Given an $r$-graph $H$, the minimum codegree $\delta_{r-1}(H)$ is the largest integer $t$ such that every $(r-1)$-subset of $V(H)$ is contained in at least $t$ edges of $H$. Given an $r$-graph $F$, the codegree Tur\'an density $\gamma(F)$ is the smallest $\gamma &gt,0$ such that every $r$-graph on $n$ vertices with $\delta_{r-1}(H)\ge (\gamma + o(1))n$ contains $F$ as a subhypergraph. Using results on the independence number of hypergraphs, we show that there are constants $c_1, c_2&gt,0$ depending only on $r$ such that \[ 1 - c_2 \frac{\ln t}{t^{r-1}} \le \gamma(K_t^r) \le 1 - c_1 \frac{\ln t}{t^{r-1}}, \] where $K_t^r$ is the complete $r$-graph on $t$ vertices. This gives the best general bounds for $\gamma(K_t^r)$.;math.CO
1801.01394;Prediction Error Bounds for Linear Regression With the TREX;The TREX is a recently introduced approach to sparse linear regression. In contrast to most well-known approaches to penalized regression, the TREX can be formulated without the use of tuning parameters. In this paper, we establish the first known prediction error bounds for the TREX. Additionally, we introduce extensions of the TREX to a more general class of penalties, and we provide a bound on the prediction error in this generalized setting. These results deepen the understanding of TREX from a theoretical perspective and provide new insights into penalized regression in general.;math.ST
1801.01412;Operator scaling with specified marginals;The completely positive maps, a generalization of the nonnegative matrices, are a well-studied class of maps from $n\times n$ matrices to $m\times m$ matrices. The existence of the operator analogues of doubly stochastic scalings of matrices is equivalent to a multitude of problems in computer science and mathematics, such rational identity testing in non-commuting variables, noncommutative rank of symbolic matrices, and a basic problem in invariant theory (Garg, Gurvits, Oliveira and Wigderson, FOCS, 2016). <br />We study operator scaling with specified marginals, which is the operator analogue of scaling matrices to specified row and column sums. We characterize the operators which can be scaled to given marginals, much in the spirit of the Gurvits' algorithmic characterization of the operators that can be scaled to doubly stochastic (Gurvits, Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 2004). Our algorithm produces approximate scalings in time poly(n,m) whenever scalings exist. A central ingredient in our analysis is a reduction from the specified marginals setting to the doubly stochastic setting. <br />Operator scaling with specified marginals arises in diverse areas of study such as the Brascamp-Lieb inequalities, communication complexity, eigenvalues of sums of Hermitian matrices, and quantum information theory. Some of the known theorems in these areas, several of which had no effective proof, are straightforward consequences of our characterization theorem. For instance, we obtain a simple algorithm to find, when they exist, a tuple of Hermitian matrices with given spectra whose sum has a given spectrum. We also prove new theorems such as a generalization of Forster's theorem (Forster, Journal of Computer and System Sciences, 2002) concerning radial isotropic position.;math.CO
1801.01417;Minimization of the eigenvalues of the dirichlet-laplacian with a diameter constraint;In this paper we look for the domains minimizing the h-th eigenvalue of the Dirichlet-Laplacian $\lambda$ h with a constraint on the diameter. Existence of an optimal domain is easily obtained, and is attained at a constant width body. In the case of a simple eigenvalue, we provide non standard (i.e., non local) optimality conditions. Then we address the question whether or not the disk is an optimal domain in the plane, and we give the precise list of the 17 eigenvalues for which the disk is a local minimum. We conclude by some numerical simulations showing the 20 first optimal domains in the plane.;math.AP
1801.01418;Quantitative estimates for bending energies and applications to non-local variational problems;We discuss a variational model, given by a weighted sum of perimeter, bending and Riesz interaction energies, that could be considered as a toy model for charged elastic drops. The different contributions have competing preferences for strongly localized and maximally dispersed structures. We investigate the energy landscape in dependence of the size of the 'charge', i.e. the weight of the Riesz interaction energy. In the two-dimensional case we first prove that for simply connected sets of small elastic energy, the elastic deficit controls the isoperimetric deficit. Building on this result, we show that for small charge the only minimizers of the full variational model are either balls or centered annuli. We complement these statements by a non-existence result for large charge. In three dimensions, we prove area and diameter bounds for configurations with small Willmore energy and show that balls are the unique minimizers of our variational model for sufficiently small charge.;math.AP
1801.01428;A Phase Transition in a Widom-Rowlinson Model with Curie-Weiss Interaction;An analog of the continuum Widom-Rowlinson model is introduced and studied. Its two-component version is a gas of point particles of types 0 and 1 placed in $\mathds{R}^d$, in which like particles do not interact and unlike particles contained in a vessel of volume $V$ repel each other with intensity $a/V$. The one-component version is a gas of particles with multi-particle interactions of Curie-Weiss type. Its thermodynamic behavior is obtained by integrating out the coordinates of one of the components of the two-component version. In the grand canonical setting, a rigorous theory of phase transitions in this model is developed and discussed. In particular, for both versions thermodynamic phases and phase diagrams are explicitly constructed and the equations of state are obtained and analyzed.;math-ph
1801.01429;Cohomological Hall algebras for Higgs torsion sheaves, moduli of triples and sheaves on surfaces;For any free oriented Borel-Moore homology theory $A$, we construct an associative product on the $A$-theory of the stack of Higgs torsion sheaves over a projective curve $C$. We show that the resulting algebra $A\mathbf{Ha}_C^0$ admits a natural shuffle presentation, and prove it is faithful when $A$ is replaced with usual Borel-Moore homology groups. We also introduce moduli spaces of stable triples, heavily inspired by Nakajima quiver varieties, whose $A$-theory admits an $A\mathbf{Ha}_C^0$-action. These triples can be interpreted as certain sheaves on $\mathbb P(T^*C)$. In particular, we obtain an action of $A\mathbf{Ha}_C^0$ on the cohomology of Hilbert schemes of points on $T^*C$.;math.RT
1801.01438;On the class of flat stable theories;A new notion of independence relation is given and associated to it, the class of flat theories, a subclass of strong stable theories including the superstable ones is introduced. More precisely, after introducing this independence relation, flat theories are defined as an appropriate version of superstability. It is shown that in a flat theory every type has finite weight and therefore flat theories are strong. Furthermore, it is shown that under reasonable conditions any type is non-orthogonal to a regular one. Concerning groups in flat theories, it is shown that type-definable groups behave like superstable ones, since they satisfy the same chain condition on definable subgroups and also admit a normal series of definable subgroup with semi-regular quotients.;math.LO
1801.01440;Arboreal Cantor actions;In this paper, we consider minimal equicontinuous actions of discrete countably generated groups on Cantor sets, obtained from the arboreal representations of absolute Galois groups of fields. In particular, we study the asymptotic discriminant of these actions. <br />The asymptotic discriminant is an invariant obtained by restricting the action to a sequence of nested clopen sets, and studying the isotropies of the enveloping group actions in such restricted systems. An enveloping (Ellis) group of such an action is a profinite group. <br />A large class of actions of profinite groups on Cantor sets is given by arboreal representations of absolute Galois groups of fields. We show how to associate to an arboreal representation an action of a discrete group, and give examples of arboreal representations with stable and wild asymptotic discriminant.;math.DS
1801.01448;A Beurling-Chen-Hadwin-Shen Theorem for Noncommutative Hardy Spaces Associated with Semifinite von Neumann Algebras with Unitarily Invariant Norms;We introduce a class of unitarily invariant, locally $\|\cdot\|_1$-dominating, mutually continuous norms with repect to $\tau$ on a von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{M}$ with a faithful, normal, semifinite tracial weight $\tau$. We prove a Beurling-Chen-Hadwin-Shen theorem for $H^\infty$-invariant spaces of $L^\alpha(\mathcal{M},\tau)$, where $\alpha$ is a unitarily invariant, locally $\|\cdot\|_1$-dominating, mutually continuous norm with respect to $\tau$, and $H^\infty$ is an extension of Arveson's noncommutative Hardy space. We use our main result to characterize the $H^\infty$-invariant subspaces of a noncommutative Banach function space $\mathcal I(\tau)$ with the norm $\|\cdot\|_{E }$ on $\mathcal{M}$, the crossed product of a semifinite von Neumann algebra by an action $\beta$, and $B(\mathcal{H})$ for a separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$.;math.OA
1801.01457;Biharmonic functions on spheres and hyperbolic spaces;We construct new explicit proper r-harmonic functions on the standard n-dimensional sphere S^n and hyperbolic space H^n for any r\ge 1 and n\ge 2.;math.DG
1801.01460;Hyperbolicity and bifurcations in holomorphic families of polynomial skew products;We initiate a parametric study of holomorphic families of polynomial skew products, i.e., polynomial endomorphisms of $\mathbb{C}^2$ of the form $F(z,w)= (p(z), q(z,w))$ that extend to holomorphic endomorphisms of $\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{C})$. We prove that dynamical stability in the sense of <a href="/abs/1403.7603">arXiv:1403.7603</a> preserves hyperbolicity within such families, and give a complete classification of the hyperbolic components that are the analogue, in this setting, of the complement of the Mandelbrot set for the family $z^2 +c$. We also precisely describe the geometry of the bifurcation locus and current near the boundary of the parameter space. One of our tools is an asymptotic equidistribution property for the bifurcation current. This is established in the general setting of families of endomorphisms of $\mathbb{P}^k$ and is the first equidistribution result of this kind for holomorphic dynamical systems in dimension larger than one.;math.DS
1801.01461;A New HDG Method for Dirichlet Boundary Control of Convection Diffusion PDEs I: High Regularity;We propose a new hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method to approximate the solution of a Dirichlet boundary control problem governed by an elliptic convection diffusion PDE. Even without a convection term, Dirichlet boundary control problems are well-known to be very challenging theoretically and numerically. Although there are many works in the literature on Dirichlet boundary control problems for the Poisson equation, the authors are not aware of any existing theoretical or numerical analysis works for convection diffusion Dirichlet control problems. We make two contributions. First, we obtain well-posedness and regularity results for the Dirichlet control problem. Second, under certain assumptions on the domain and the target state, we obtain optimal a priori error estimates in 2D for the control for the new HDG method. As far as the authors are aware, there are no existing comparable results in the literature. We present numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the HDG method.;math.NA
1801.01463;L&#x27,espace ad&#xe9,lique d&#x27,un tore sur un corps de fonctions;Let $k$ be a field of characteristic 0 and let $K$ be the function field of a smooth projective geometrically integral $k$-curve $X$. Let $T$ be a $K$-torus. In this article, we aim at studying the space of adelic points $T(S,\mathbb{A}_K)$ of $T$ outside a finite set $S$ of closed points of $X$. We start by proving that the group $T(K)$ of rational points of $T$ is always discrete (hence closed) in $T(S,\mathbb{A}_K)$. We then describe the quotient $T(\emptyset,\mathbb{A}_K)/T(K)$ in each of the following three cases: $k$ is an algebraically closed field, $k$ is the field of Laurent series $\mathbb{C}((t))$, and $k$ is a $p$-adic field. <br />Soient $k$ un corps de caract\'eristique 0 et $K$ le corps des fonctions d'une $k$-courbe projective lisse g\'eom\'etriquement int\`egre $X$. Soit $T$ un $K$-tore. Dans cet article, on cherche \`a \'etudier l'espace des points ad\'eliques $T(S,\mathbb{A}_K)$ de $T$ hors d'un ensemble fini $S$ de points ferm\'es de $X$. On commence par montrer que le groupe $T(K)$ des points rationnels de $T$ est toujours ferm\'e discret dans $T(S,\mathbb{A}_K)$. On d\'ecrit ensuite le quotient $T(\emptyset,\mathbb{A}_K)/T(K)$ dans chacun des trois cas suivants: $k$ corps alg\'ebriquement clos, $k=\mathbb{C}((t))$ et $k$ corps $p$-adique.;math.AG
1801.01482;Finite semilattices with many congruences;For an integer $n\geq 2$, let NCSL$(n)$ denote the set of sizes of congruence lattices of $n$-element semilattices. We find the four largest numbers belonging to NCSL$(n)$, provided that $n$ is large enough to ensure that $|$NCSL$(n)|\geq 4$. Furthermore, we describe the $n$-element semilattices witnessing these numbers.;math.RA
1801.01485;Variational analysis and variational rationality in behavioral sciences: stationary traps;This paper concerns applications of variational analysis to some local aspects of behavioral science modeling by developing an effective variational rationality approach to these and related issues. Our main attention is paid to local stationary traps, which reflect such local equilibrium and the like positions in behavioral science models that are not worthwhile to quit. We establish constructive linear optimistic evaluations of local stationary traps by using generalized differential tools of variational analysis that involve subgradients and normals for nonsmooth and nonconvex objects as well as variational and extremal principles.;math.OC
1801.01491;The Action of Young Subgroups on the Partition Complex;We study the restrictions, the strict fixed points, and the strict quotients of the partition complex $|\Pi_n|$, which is the $\Sigma_n$-space attached to the poset of proper nontrivial partitions of the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. <br />We express the space of fixed points $|\Pi_n|^G$ in terms of subgroup posets for general $G\subset \Sigma_n$ and prove a formula for the restriction of $|\Pi_n|$ to Young subgroups $\Sigma_{n_1}\times \dots\times \Sigma_{n_k}$. Both results follow by applying a general method, proven with discrete Morse theory, for producing equivariant branching rules on lattices with group actions. We uncover surprising links between strict Young quotients of $|\Pi_n|$, commutative monoid spaces, and the cotangent fibre in derived algebraic geometry. These connections allow us to construct a cofibre sequence relating various strict quotients $|\Pi_n|^\diamond\wedge_{\Sigma_n} (S^\ell)^{\wedge n}$ and give a combinatorial proof of a splitting in derived algebraic geometry. Combining all our results, we decompose strict Young quotients of $|\Pi_n|$ in terms of "atoms" $|\Pi_d|^\diamond\wedge_{\Sigma_d} (S^\ell)^{\wedge d}$ for $\ell$ odd and compute their homology. We thereby also generalise Goerss' computation of the algebraic Andr\'e-Quillen homology of trivial square-zero extensions from $\mathbb{F}_2$ to $\mathbb{F}_p$ for $p$ an odd prime.;math.AT
1801.01512;Hats: all or nothing;N players are randomly fitted with a colored hat (q different colors). All players guess simultaneously the color of their own hat observing only the hat colors of the other N-1 players. The team wins if all players guess right. No communication of any sort is allowed, except for an initial strategy session before the game begins. In the first part of our investigation we have q different colors with equal probability. Up to 4 colors we construct optimal strategies for any number of players using Hamming Complete Sets. For 5 colors we find optimal strategies up to 5 players using Optimal Hamming Sets. In the second part we have two colors where the probabilities may differ. We construct optimal strategies and maximal probability of winning the game for any number of players.;math.CO
1801.01526;An algebraic perspective on integer sparse recovery;Compressed sensing is a relatively new mathematical paradigm that shows a small number of linear measurements are enough to efficiently reconstruct a large dimensional signal under the assumption the signal is sparse. Applications for this technology are ubiquitous, ranging from wireless communications to medical imaging, and there is now a solid foundation of mathematical theory and algorithms to robustly and efficiently reconstruct such signals. However, in many of these applications, the signals of interest do not only have a sparse representation, but have other structure such as lattice-valued coefficients. While there has been a small amount of work in this setting, it is still not very well understood how such extra information can be utilized during sampling and reconstruction. Here, we explore the problem of integer sparse reconstruction, lending insight into when this knowledge can be useful, and what types of sampling designs lead to robust reconstruction guarantees. We use a combination of combinatorial, probabilistic and number-theoretic methods to discuss existence and some constructions of such sensing matrices with concrete examples. We also prove sparse versions of Minkowski's Convex Body and Linear Forms theorems that exhibit some limitations of this framework.;math.NA
1801.01530;The Mutating Contact Process: Model Introduction and Qualitative Analysis of Phase Transitions in its Survival;We introduce and study the mutating contact process, a variant of the multitype contact process, where one type mutates at a constant rate to the other type. We prove that on $\mathbb{Z}$ a single mutant cannot survive while on $\mathbb{T}_{d}$ there are distinct weak survival and extinction of a single mutant phases, yet the limiting distribution concentrates on configurations with no mutants of the first type for any values of the parameters.;math.PR
1801.01537;Tauberian class estimates for vector-valued distributions;We study Tauberian properties of regularizing transforms of vector-valued tempered distributions, that is, transforms of the form $M^{\mathbf{f}}_{\varphi}(x,y)=(\mathbf{f}\ast\varphi_{y})(x)$, where the kernel $\varphi$ is a test function and $\varphi_{y}(\cdot)=y^{-n}\varphi(\cdot/y)$. We investigate conditions which ensure that a distribution that a priori takes values in locally convex space actually takes values in a narrower Banach space. Our goal is to characterize spaces of Banach space valued tempered distributions in terms of so-called class estimates for the transform $M^{\mathbf{f}}_{\varphi}(x,y)$. Our results generalize and improve earlier Tauberian theorems of Drozhzhinov and Zav'yalov [Sb. Math. 194 (2003), 1599-1646]. Special attention is paid to find the optimal class of kernels $\varphi$ for which these Tauberian results hold.;math.FA
1801.01540;Jacob&#x27,s Ladder: Prime numbers in 2d;Prime numbers are one of the most intriguing figures in mathematics. Despite centuries of research, many questions remain still unsolved. In recent years, computer simulations are playing a fundamental role in the study of an immense variety of problems. In this work, we present a simple representation of prime numbers in two dimensions that allows us to formulate a number of conjectures that may lead to important avenues in the field of research on prime numbers. In particular, although the zeroes in our representation grow in a somewhat erratic, hardly predictable way, the gaps between them present a remarkable and intriguing property: a clear exponential decay in the frequency of gaps vs gap size. The smaller the gaps, the more frequently they appear. Additionally, the sequence of zeroes, despite being non-consecutive numbers, contains a number of primes approximately equal to n/log(n) , being n the number of terms in the sequence.;math.HO
1801.01542;Congruences of Power Sums;The following congruence for power sums, $S_n(p)$, is well known and has many applications: $1^n+2^n +\dots +p^n \equiv\begin{cases} -1 \text{ mod } p, &amp, \text{ if } \ p-1 \ | \ n, 0 \text{ mod } p, &amp, \text{ if } \ p-1 \ \not| \ n, \end{cases}$ where $n\in{\mathbb N}$ and $p$ is prime. We extend this congruence, in particular, to the case when $p$ is any power of a prime. We also show that the sequence $(S_n(m) \text{ mod } k )_{m \geq 1}$ is periodic and determine its period.;math.NT
1801.01544;Boundary value problem with measures for fractional elliptic equations involving source nonlinearities;We are concerned with positive solutions of equation (E) $(-\Delta)^s u=f(u)$ in a domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ ($N&gt,2s$), where $s \in (\frac{1}{2},1)$ and $f\in C^{\alpha}_{loc}(\mathbb{R})$ for some $\alpha \in(0,1)$. We establish a universal a priori estimate for positive solutions of (E), as well as for their gradients. Then for $C^2$ bounded domain $\Omega$, we prove the existence of positive solutions of (E) with prescribed boundary value $\rho \nu$, where $\rho&gt,0$ and $\nu$ is a positive Radon measure on $\partial \Omega$ with total mass $1$, and discuss regularity property of the solutions. When $f(u)=u^p$, we demonstrate that there exists a critical exponent $p_s:=\frac{N+s}{N-s}$ in the following sense. If $p\geq p_s$, the problem does not admit any positive solution with $\nu$ being a Dirac mass. If $p\in(1,p_s)$ there exits a threshold value $\rho^*&gt,0$ such that for $\rho\in (0, \rho^*]$, the problem admits a positive solution and for $\rho&gt,\rho^*$, no positive solution exists. We also show that, for $\rho&gt,0$ small enough, the problem admits at least two positive solutions.;math.AP
1801.01546;Characterization of distributions of $Q$-independent random variables on locally compact Abelian groups;Let $X$ be a second countable locally compact Abelian group. We prove some group analogues of the Skitovich--Darmois, Heyde and Kac--Bernstein characterisation theorems for $Q$-independent random variables taking values in the group $X$. The proofs of these theorems are reduced to solving some functional equations on the character group of the group $X$.;math.PR
1801.01552;Asymptotic bounds for spherical codes;The set of all error-correcting codes C over a fixed finite alphabet F of cardinality q determines the set of code points in the unit square with coordinates (R(C), delta (C)):= (relative transmission rate, relative minimal distance). The central problem of the theory of such codes consists in maximizing simultaneously the transmission rate of the code and the relative minimum Hamming distance between two different code words. The classical approach to this problem explored in vast literature consists in the inventing explicit constructions of "good codes" and comparing new classes of codes with earlier ones. Less classical approach studies the geometry of the whole set of code points (R,delta) (with q fixed), at first independently of its computability properties, and only afterwords turning to the problems of computability, analogies with statistical physics etc. The main purpose of this article consists in extending this latter strategy to domain of spherical codes.;cs.IT
1801.01555;Reeb Posets and Tree Approximations;A well known result in the analysis of finite metric spaces due to Gromov says that given any $(X,d_X)$ there exists a \emph{tree metric} $t_X$ on $X$ such that $\|d_X-t_X\|_\infty$ is bounded above by twice $\mathrm{hyp}(X)\cdot \log(2\,|X|)$. Here $\mathrm{hyp}(X)$ is the \emph{hyperbolicity} of $X$, a quantity that measures the \emph{treeness} of $4$-tuples of points in $X$. This bound is known to be asymptotically tight. <br />We improve this bound by restricting ourselves to metric spaces arising from filtered posets. By doing so we are able to replace the cardinality appearing in Gromov's bound by a certain poset theoretic invariant (the maximum length of fences in the poset) which can be much smaller thus significantly improving the approximation bound. <br />The setting of metric spaces arising from posets is rich: For example, save for the possible addition of new vertices, every finite metric graph can be induced from a filtered poset. Since every finite metric space can be isometrically embedded into a finite metric graph, our ideas are applicable to finite metric spaces as well. <br />At the core of our results lies the adaptation of the Reeb graph and Reeb tree constructions and the concept of hyperbolicity to the setting of posets, which we use to formulate and prove a tree approximation result for any filtered poset.;math.MG
1801.01556;A bound on the inducibility of cycles;In 1975, Pippenger and Golumbic conjectured that every n-vertex graph has at most $n^k/(k^k - k)$ induced cycles of length k for k at least 5. We prove that every n-vertex graph has at most $2 n^k/k^k$ induced cycles of length k.;math.CO
1801.01561;Multiplicity freeness of unitary representations in sections of holomorphic Hilbert bundles;We prove several results asserting that the action of a Banach-Lie group on Hilbert spaces of holomorphic sections of a holomorphic Hilbert space bundle over a complex Banach manifold is multiplicity free. These results require the existence of compatible antiholomorphic bundle maps and certain multiplicity freeness assumptions for stabilizer groups. For the group action on the base, the notion of an $(S,\sigma)$-weakly visible action (generalizing T.Koboyashi's visible actions) provides an effective way to express the assumptions in an economical fashion. In particular, we derive a version for group actions on homogeneous bundles for larger groups. We illustrate these general results by several examples related to operator groups and von Neumann algebras.;math.RT
1801.01562;The Distortion of the Reeb Quotient Map on Riemannian Manifolds;Given a metric space $X$ and a function $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$, the Reeb construction gives metric a space $X_f$ together with a quotient map $X \to X_f$. Under suitable conditions $X_f$ becomes a metric graph and can therefore be used as a graph approximation to $X$. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance from $X_f$ to $X$ is bounded by the half of the metric distortion of the quotient map. In this paper we consider the case where $X$ is a compact Riemannian manifold and $f$ is an excellent Morse function. In this case we provide bounds on the distortion of the quotient map which involve the first Betti number of the original space and a novel invariant which we call thickness.;math.MG
1801.01564;Expansion of Iterated Stratonovich Stochastic Integrals of Multiplicity 3, Based on Generalized Multiple Fourier Series, Converging in the Mean: General Case of Series Summation;The article is devoted to the development of the method of expansion and mean-square approximation of iterated Ito stochastic integrals, based on generalized multiple Fourier series, converging in the mean. We adapt this method for iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of multiplicity 3 from the Taylor-Stratonovich expansion. The main result of the article has been derived with using the triple Fourier-Legendre series as well as the triple trigonometric Fourier series for the general case of series summation. The results of the article can be applied to numerical integration of Ito stochastic differential equations in accordance with the strong criterion of convergence.;math.PR
1801.01566;Adaptive Finite Element Solution of the Porous Medium Equation in Pressure Formulation;A lack of regularity in the solution of the porous medium equation poses a serious challenge in its theoretical and numerical studies. A common strategy in theoretical studies is to utilize the pressure formulation of the equation where a new variable called the mathematical pressure is introduced. It is known that the new variable has much better regularity than the original one and Darcy's law for the movement of the free boundary can be expressed naturally in this new variable. The pressure formulation has not been used in numerical studies. The goal of this work is to study its use in the adaptive finite element solution of the porous medium equation. The MMPDE moving mesh strategy is employed for adaptive mesh movement while linear finite elements are used for spatial discretization. The free boundary is traced explicitly by integrating Darcy's law with the Euler scheme. Numerical results are presented for three two-dimensional examples. The method is shown to be second-order in space and first-order in time in the pressure variable. Moreover, the convergence order of the error in the location of the free boundary is almost second-order in the maximum norm. However, numerical results also show that the convergence order of the method in the original variable stays between first-order and second-order in the $L^1$ norm or between 0.5th-order and first-order in the $L^2$ norm. Nevertheless, the current method can offer some advantages over numerical methods based on the original formulation for situations with large exponents or when a more accurate location of the free boundary is desired.;math.NA
1801.01570;How Many Rounds Should You Expect in Urn Solitaire?;A certain sampling process, concerning an urn with balls of two colors, proposed in 1965 by B.E. Oakley and R.L. Perry, and discussed by Peter Winkler and Martin Gardner, that has an extremely simple answer for the probability, namely the constant function 1/2, has a far more complicated expected duration, that we discover and sketch the proof of. So unlike, for example, the classical gambler's ruin problem, for which both `probability of winning' and `expected duration' have very simple expressions, in this case the expected number of rounds is extremely complicated, and beyond the scope of humans.;math.CO
1801.01574;Testing Optimality of Sequential Decision-Making;This paper provides a statistical method to test whether a system that performs a binary sequential hypothesis test is optimal in the sense of minimizing the average decision times while taking decisions with given reliabilities. The proposed method requires samples of the decision times, the decision outcomes, and the true hypotheses, but does not require knowledge on the statistics of the observations or the properties of the decision-making system. The method is based on fluctuation relations for decision time distributions which are proved for sequential probability ratio tests. These relations follow from the martingale property of probability ratios and hold under fairly general conditions. We illustrate these tests with numerical experiments and discuss potential applications.;cs.IT
1801.01575;Punctured spheres in complex hyperbolic surfaces and bielliptic ball quotient compactifications;In this paper, we study punctured spheres in two dimensional ball quotient compactifications $(X, D)$. For example, we show that smooth toroidal compactifications of ball quotients cannot contain properly holomorphically embedded $3$-punctured spheres. We also use totally geodesic punctured spheres to prove ampleness of $K_X + \alpha D$ for $\alpha \in (\frac{1}{4}, 1)$, giving a sharp version of a theorem of the first author with G. Di Cerbo. Finally, we produce the first examples of bielliptic ball quotient compactifications modeled on the Gaussian integers.;math.GT
1801.01578;A Robust Preconditioner for High-Contrast Problems;A finite-element discretization of such an equation yields a linear system whose conditioning worsens as the variations in the values of PDE coefficients becomes large. This paper introduces a procedure by which the discrete system obtained from a linear finite element discretization of the given continuum problem is converted into an equivalent linear system of the saddle point type. Then a robust preconditioner for the Lanczos method of minimized iterations for solving the derived saddle point problem is proposed. Robustness with respect to the contrast parameter and the mesh size is justified. Numerical examples support theoretical results and demonstrate independence of the number of iterations on the contrast, the mesh size and also on the different contrasts on the inclusions.;math.NA
1801.01581;Frobenius-Perron Theory of Modified ADE Bound Quiver Algebras;The Frobenius-Perron dimension for an abelian category was recently introduced. We apply this theory to the category of representations of the finite-dimensional radical squared zero algebras associated to certain modified ADE graphs. In particular, we take an ADE quiver with arrows in a certain orientation and an arbitrary number of loops at each vertex. We show that the Frobenius-Perron dimension of this category is equal to the maximum number of loops at a vertex. Along the way, we introduce a result which can be applied in general to calculate the Frobenius-Perron dimension of a radical square zero bound quiver algebra. We use this result to introduce a family of abelian categories which produce arbitrarily large irrational Frobenius-Perron dimensions.;math.RA
1801.01584;Fixation probabilities and hitting times under low levels of frequency-dependent selection;In population genetics, diffusions on the unit interval are often used to model the frequency path of an allele. In this setting we derive approximations for fixation probabilities, expected hitting times and the expected site-frequency-spectrum under small frequency-dependent selection. Specifically, we rederive and extend the one-third rule of evolutionary game theory (Nowak et al., 2004) and effects of stochastic slowdown (Altrock and Traulsen, 2009). Since similar effects are of interest in other application areas, we formulate our results for general one-dimensional diffusions.;math.PR
1801.01588;On a class of polynomials connected to Bell polynomials;In this paper, we study a class of sequences of polynomials linked to the sequence of Bell polynomials. Some sequences of this class have applications on the theory of hyperbolic differential equations and other sequences generalize Laguerre polynomials and associated Lah polynomials. We discuss, for these polynomials, their explicit expressions, relations to the successive derivatives of a given function, real zeros and recurrence relations. Some known results are significantly simplified.;math.CO
1801.01593;Estimation in the spiked Wigner model: A short proof of the replica formula;We consider the problem of estimating a rank-one perturbation of a Wigner matrix in a setting of low signal-to-noise ratio. This serves as a simple model for principal component analysis in high dimensions. The mutual information per variable between the spike and the observed matrix, or equivalently, the normalized Kullback-Leibler divergence between the planted and null models are known to converge to the so-called {\em replica-symmetric} formula, the properties of which determine the fundamental limits of estimation in this model. We provide in this note a short and transparent proof of this formula, based on simple executions of Gaussian interpolations and standard concentration-of-measure arguments. The \emph{Franz-Parisi potential}, that is, the free entropy at a fixed overlap, plays an important role in our proof. Furthermore, our proof can be generalized straightforwardly to spiked tensor models of even order.;cs.IT
1801.01605;Distance between arithmetic progressions and perfect squares;In this paper, we study how close the terms of a finite arithmetic progression can get to a perfect square.

1801.01608;The Definition and Numerical Method of Final Value Problem and Arbitrary Value Problem;Many Engineering Problems could be mathematically described by Final Value Problem, which is the inverse problem of Initial Value Problem. Accordingly, the paper studies the final value problem in the field of ODE problems and analyses the differences and relations between initial and final value problems. The more general new concept of the endpoints-value problem which could describe both initial and final problems is proposed. Further, we extend the concept into inner-interval value problem and arbitrary value problem and point out that both endpoints-value problem and inner-interval value problem are special forms of arbitrary value problem. Particularly, the existence and uniqueness of the solutions of final value problem and inner-interval value problem of first order ordinary differential equation are proved for discrete problems. The numerical calculation formulas of the problems are derived, and for each algorithm, we propose the convergence and stability conditions of them. Furthermore, multivariate and high-order final value problems are further studied, and the condition of fixed delay is also discussed in this paper. At last, the effectiveness of the considered methods is validated by numerical experiment.;math.NA
1801.01610;On Convergence to Essential Singularities;An iterative optimization method applied to a function $f$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ will produce a sequence of arguments $\{\mathbf{x}_k\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, this sequence is often constrained such that $\{f(\mathbf{x}_k)\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ is monotonic. As part of the analysis of an iterative method, one may ask under what conditions the sequence $\{\mathbf{x}_k\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges. In 2005, Absil et al.\ employed the {\L}ojasiewicz gradient inequality in a proof of convergence, this requires that the objective function exist at a cluster point of the sequence. Here we provide a convergence result that does not require $f$ to be defined at the limit $\lim_{k \to \infty} \mathbf{x}_k$, should the limit exist. We show that a variant of the {\L}ojasiewicz gradient inequality holds on sets adjacent to singularities of bounded multivariate rational functions. We extend the results of Absil et al.\ to prove that if $\{\mathbf{x}_k\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ has a cluster point $\mathbf{x}_*$, if $f$ is a bounded multivariate rational function on $\mathbb{R}^n$, and if a technical condition holds, then $\mathbf{x}_k \to \mathbf{x}_*$ even if $\mathbf{x}_*$ is not in the domain of $f$. We demonstrate how this may be employed to analyze divergent sequences by mapping them to projective space, and consider the implications this has for the study of low-rank tensor approximations.;math.NA
1801.01613;High Throughput Low Delay Wireless Multicast via Multi-Channel Moving Window Codes;A fundamental challenge in wireless multicast has been how to simultaneously achieve high-throughput and low-delay for reliably serving a large number of users. In this paper, we show how to harness substantial throughput and delay gains by exploiting multi-channel resources. We develop a new scheme called Multi-Channel Moving Window Codes (MC-MWC) for multi-channel multi-session wireless multicast. The salient features of MC-MWC are three-fold. (i) High throughput: we show that MC-MWC achieves order-optimal throughput in the many-user many-channel asymptotic regime. Moreover, the number of channels required by a conventional channel-allocation based scheme is shown to be doubly-exponentially larger than that required by MC-MWC. (ii) Low delay: using large deviations theory, we show that the delay of MC-MWC decreases linearly with the number of channels, while the delay reduction of conventional schemes is no more than a finite constant. (iii) Low feedback overhead: the feedback overhead of MC-MWC is a constant that is independent of both the number of receivers in each session and the number of sessions in the network. Finally, our trace-driven simulation and numerical results validate the analytical results and show that the implementation complexity of MC-MWC is low.;cs.IT
1801.01619;Anticyclotomic $p$-adic $L$-functions for elliptic curves at some additive reduction primes;Let $E$ be a rational elliptic curve and let $p$ be an odd prime of additive reduction. Let $K$ be an imaginary quadratic field and fix a positive integer $c$ prime to the conductor of $E$. The main goal of the present article is to define an anticyclotomic $p$-adic $L$-function $\L$ attached to $E/K$ when $E/\QQ_p$ attains semistable reduction over an abelian extension. We prove that $\L$ satisfies the expected interpolation properties, namely, we show that if $\chi$ is an anticyclotomic character of conductor $cp^n$ then $\chi(\L)$ is equal (up to explicit constants) to $L(E,\chi,1)$ or $L'(E,\chi,1)$.;math.NT
1801.01625;Optimal Pilot Symbols Ratio in terms of Spectrum and Energy Efficiency in Uplink CoMP Networks;In wireless networks, Spectrum Efficiency (SE) and Energy Efficiency (EE) can be affected by the channel estimation that needs to be well designed in practice. In this paper, considering channel estimation error and non-ideal backhaul links, we optimize the pilot symbols ratio in terms of SE and EE in uplink Coordinated Multi-point (CoMP) networks. Modeling the channel estimation error, we formulate the SE and EE maximization problems by analyzing the system capacity with imperfect channel estimation. The maximal system capacity in SE optimization and the minimal transmit power in EE optimization, which both have the closed-form expressions, are derived by some reasonable approximations to reduce the complexity of solving complicated equations. Simulations are carried out to validate the superiority of our scheme, verify the accuracy of our approximation, and show the effect of pilot symbols ratio.;cs.IT
1801.01626;Weighted estimates and Fujita exponent for a nonlocal equation;We investigate a nonlocal equation $\partial_tu=\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}J(x-y)(u(y,t)-u(x,t))dy+a(x,t)u^p$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $a$ is unbounded and $J$ belongs to a weighted space. Crucial weighted $L^p$ and interpolation estimates for the Green operator are established by a new method based on the sharp Young's inequality, the asymptotic behavior of a regular varying coefficients exponential series, and the properties of auxiliary functions $\varGamma=(1+|x|^2/\eta)^{b/2}$ that $-\varGamma/\eta\lesssim J\ast\varGamma-\varGamma\lesssim\varGamma/\eta$ and $\eta^{-b_+/2}\lesssim\varGamma/\left\langle x\right\rangle^b\lesssim \eta^{-b_-/2}$. Blow-up behaviors are investigated by employing test functions $\phi_R=\varGamma$ ($\eta=R$) instead of principal eigenfunctions. Global well-posedness in weighted $L^p$ spaces for the Cauchy problem is proved. When $a\sim\left\langle x\right\rangle^\sigma$ the Fujita exponent is shown to be $1+(\sigma+2)/n$. Our approach generalizes and unifies nonlocal diffusion equations and pseudoparabolic equations.;math.AP

In order to study homogeneous system of linear differential equations, I considered vector space over division $D$-algebra, solving of linear equations over division $D$-algebra and the theory of eigenvalues in non commutative division $D$-algebra.

1801.01629;Euler evolution of a concentrated vortex in planar bounded domains;In this paper, we consider the time evolution of an ideal fluid in a planar bounded domain. We prove that if the initial vorticity is supported in a sufficiently small region with diameter $\varepsilon$, then the time evolved vorticity is also supported in a small region with diameter $d$, $d\leq C\varepsilon^{\alpha}$ for any $\alpha&lt,\frac{1}{3}$, and the center of the vorticity tends to the point vortex, the motion of which is described by the Kirchhoff-Routh equation.;math.AP
1801.01642;Parity Considerations in Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon Type Overpartitions;In 2010, Andrews considers a variety of parity questions connected to classical partition identities of Euler, Rogers, Ramanujan and Gordon. As a large part in his paper, Andrews considered the partitions by restricting the parity of occurrences of even numbers or odd numbers in the Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon type. The Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon type partition was defined by Gordon in 1961 as a combinatorial generalization of the Rogers-Ramaujan identities with odd moduli. <br />In 1974, Andrews derived an identity which can be considered as the generating function counterpart of the Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon theorem, and since then it has been called the Andrews--Gordon identity. By revisting the Andrews--Gordon identity Andrews extended his results by considering some additional restrictions involving parities to obtain some Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon type theorems and Andrews--Gordon type identities. In the end of Andrews' paper, he posed $15$ open problems. Most of Andrews' $15$ open problems have been settled, but the $11$th that "extend the parity indices to overpartitions in a manner" has not. In 2013, Chen, Sang and Shi, derived the overpartition analogues of the Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon theorem and the Andrews-Gordon identity. In this paper, we post some parity restrictions on these overpartitions analogues to get some Rogers-Ramanujan-Gordon type overpartition theorems.;math.CO
1801.01648;Energy-Efficient User Access Control and Resource Allocation in HCNs with Non-Ideal Circuitry;In this paper, we study the energy-efficient user access control (UAC) based on resource allocation (RA) in heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs) with the required downlink data rate under non-ideal power amplifiers (PAs) and circuit power. It is proved that the energy consumption minimization is achieved when the typical user accesses only one base station (BS), while the other BSs remain in idle mode on the transmission resource allocated to this user. For this purpose, we reformulate the original non-convex optimization problem into a series of convex optimization problems where, in each case, the transmit power and duration of the accessed BS are determined. Then, the BS with the minimal energy consumption is selected for transmission. Considering the approximate situation, it is showed that the optimal transmit duration of the accessed BS can be estimated in closed form. The benefits of our proposed UAC and RA schemes are validated using numerical simulations, which also characterize the effect that non-ideal PAs have on the total energy consumption of different transmission schemes.;cs.IT
1801.01652;Energy Efficiency Maximization for CoMP Joint Transmission with Non-Ideal Power Amplifiers;Coordinated multipoint (CoMP) joint transmission (JT) can save a great deal of energy especially for cell-edge users due to strengthened received signal, but at the cost of deploying and coordinating cooperative nodes, which degrades energy efficiency (EE), particularly when considerable amount of energy is consumed by nonideal hardware circuit. In this paper, we study energyefficient cooperation establishment, including cooperative nodes selection (CNS) and power allocation, to satisfy a required data rate in coherent JT-CoMP networks with non-ideal power amplifiers (PAs) and circuit power. The selection priority lemma is proved first, and then the formulated discrete combinatorial EE optimization is resolved by proposing node selection criterion and deriving closedform expressions of optimal transmission power. Therefore, an efficient algorithm is provided and its superiority is validated by Monte Carlo simulations, which also show the effects of non-ideal PA and the data rate demand on EE and optimal number of active nodes.;cs.IT

1801.01663;Energy Efficiency Analysis of Heterogeneous Cellular Networks With Extra Cell Range Expansion;The split control and user plane is key to the future heterogeneous cellular network (HCN), where the small cells are dedicated for the most data transmission while the macrocells are mainly responsible for the control signaling. Adapting to this technology, we propose a general and tractable framework of extra cell range expansion (CRE) by introducing an additional bias factor to enlarge the range of small cells flexibly for the extra offloaded macrousers in a two-tier HCN, where the macrocell and small cell users have different required data rates. Using stochastic geometry, we analyze the energy efficiency (EE) of the extra CRE with joint low power transmission and resource partitioning, where the coverages of EE and data rate are formulated theoretically. Numerical simulations verify that the proposed extra CRE can improve the EE performance of HCN, and also show that deploying more small cells can provide benefits for EE coverage, but the EE improvement becomes saturated if the small cell density exceeds a threshold. Instead of establishing the detail configuration, this paper can provide some valuable insights and guidelines to the practical design of future networks, especially for the traffic offloading in HCN.;cs.IT
1801.01673;On the average condition number of tensor rank decompositions;We compute the expected value of powers of the geometric condition number of random tensor rank decompositions. It is shown in particular that the expected value of the condition number of $n_1\times n_2 \times 2$ tensors with a random rank-$r$ decomposition, given by factor matrices with independent and identically distributed standard normal entries, is infinite. This entails that it is expected and probable that such a rank-$r$ decomposition is sensitive to perturbations of the tensor. Moreover, it provides concrete further evidence that tensor decomposition can be a challenging problem, also from the numerical point of view. On the other hand, we provide strong theoretical and empirical evidence that tensors of size $n_1~\times~n_2~\times~n_3$ with all $n_1,n_2,n_3 \ge 3$ have a finite average condition number. This suggests there exists a gap in the expected sensitivity of tensors between those of format $n_1\times n_2 \times 2$ and other order-3 tensors. For establishing these results, we show that a natural weighted distance from a tensor rank decomposition to the locus of ill-posed decompositions with an infinite geometric condition number is bounded from below by the inverse of this condition number. That is, we prove one inequality towards a so-called condition number theorem for the tensor rank decomposition.;math.NA

Our work involves three parts. In the first part, we construct Eisenstein series adelically and compute their constant terms by computing local integrals. In the second part, we prove a control theorem for one-variable ordinary $\Lambda$-adic Hilbert modular forms following Hida's work on the space of multivariable ordinary $\Lambda$-adic Hilbert cusp forms. In part three, we compute congruence modules related to Hilbert Eisenstein series through an analog of Ohta's methods.;math.NT

1801.01696;Empirical Bayes analysis of spike and slab posterior distributions;In the sparse normal means model, convergence of the Bayesian posterior distribution associated to spike and slab prior distributions is considered. The key sparsity hyperparameter is calibrated via marginal maximum likelihood empirical Bayes. The plug-in posterior squared-$L^2$ norm is shown to converge at the minimax rate for the euclidean norm for appropriate choices of spike and slab distributions. Possible choices include standard spike and slab with heavy tailed slab, and the spike and slab LASSO of Rockov\'a and George with heavy tailed slab. Surprisingly, the popular Laplace slab is shown to lead to a suboptimal rate for the full empirical Bayes posterior. This provides a striking example where convergence of aspects of the empirical Bayes posterior does not entail convergence of the full empirical Bayes posterior itself.;math.ST
1801.01699;Variable-Length Intrinsic Randomness Allowing Positive Value of the Average Variational Distance;This paper considers the problem of variable-length intrinsic randomness. We propose the average variational distance as the performance criterion from the viewpoint of a dual relationship with the problem formulation of variable-length resolvability. Previous study has derived the general formula of the $\epsilon$-variable-length resolvability. We derive the general formula of the $\epsilon$-variable-length intrinsic randomness. Namely, we characterize the supremum of the mean length under the constraint that the value of the average variational distance is smaller than or equal to a constant $\epsilon$. Our result clarifies a dual relationship between the general formula of $\epsilon$-variable-length resolvability and that of $\epsilon$-variable-length intrinsic randomness. We also derive a lower bound of the quantity characterizing our general formula.;cs.IT
1801.01709;Energy Efficiency Maximization of Full-Duplex Two-Way Relay With Non-Ideal Power Amplifiers and Non-Negligible Circuit Power;In this paper, we maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of full-duplex (FD) two-way relay (TWR) systems under non-ideal power amplifiers (PAs) and non-negligible transmission-dependent circuit power. We start with the case where only the relay operates full duplex and two timeslots are required for TWR. Then, we extend to the advanced case, where the relay and the two nodes all operate full duplex, and accomplish TWR in a single timeslot. In both cases, we establish the intrinsic connections between the optimal transmit powers and durations, based on which the original non-convex EE maximization can be convexified and optimally solved. Simulations show the superiority of FD-TWR in terms of EE, especially when traffic demand is high. The simulations also reveal that the maximum EE of FD-TWR is more sensitive to the PA efficiency, than it is to self-cancellation. The full FD design of FD-TWR is susceptible to traffic imbalance, while the design with only the relay operating in the FD mode exhibits strong tolerance.;cs.IT

The main results consist of global (in time) existence of weak solutions, characterization of parabolic smoothing effects (implying under proper condition eventual boundedness of trajectories), and convergence of each solution to a (single) equilibrium. In particular, to prove the convergence result, a variant of the so-called \L ojasiewicz-Simon inequality is provided for the fractional Dirichlet Laplacian and (possibly) non-analytic (but $C^1$) nonlinearities.;math.AP

1801.01730;Limit cycles of piecewise polynomial perturbations of higher dimensional linear differential systems;The averaging theory has been extensively employed for studying periodic solutions of smooth and nonsmooth differential systems. Here, we extend the averaging theory for studying periodic solutions a class of regularly perturbed non-autonomous $n$-dimensional discontinuous piecewise smooth differential system. As a fundamental hypothesis, it is assumed that the unperturbed system has a manifold $\mathcal{Z}\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ of periodic solutions satisfying $\dim(\mathcal{Z})&lt,n.$ Then, we apply this result to study limit cycles bifurcating from periodic solutions of linear differential systems, $x'=Mx$, when they are perturbed inside a class of discontinuous piecewise polynomial differential systems with two zones. More precisely, we study the periodic solutions of the following differential system $x'=Mx+ \varepsilon F_1^n(x)+\varepsilon^2F_2^n(x),$ in $\mathbb{R}^{d+2}$ where $\varepsilon$ is a small parameter, $M$ is a $(d+2)\times(d+2)$ matrix having one pair of pure imaginary conjugate eigenvalues, $m$ zeros eigenvalues, and $d-m$ non-zero real eigenvalues.;math.DS

When a tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ is graded over a group $\Gamma$, a torus-valued 3-cocycle on $\Gamma$ can be used to deform the associator of $\mathcal{C}$. Based on a natural Fell bundle structure of the tube algebra over the action groupoid of the adjoint action of $\Gamma$, we show that the tube algebra of the twisted category is a 2-cocycle twisting of the original one.;math.QA
1801.01738;Energy-efficient resource allocation for hybrid bursty services in multi-relay OFDM networks;In this paper, we propose Mapped Two-way Water Filling (MTWF) scheme to maximize Energy Efficiency (EE) for hybrid bursty services with Quality of Services (QoS) requirements in Two-Way Multi-Relay (TWMR) OFDM networks. The bursty traffic is first analyzed by strictly proved equivalent homogeneous Poisson process, based on which the QoS requirements are converted into sum-rate constraints. The formulated non-convex EE maximization problem, including subcarrier assignment, Relay Selection (RS) and rate allocation, is NP-hard involving combinatorial optimization. To conduct optimal RS on each subcarrier without priori bursty traffic knowledge, we utilize some approximate relationships under high data rate demands to remove its dependence on two-way data rates, and simplify the whole optimization problem as well. After the optimal channel configuration is obtained, which only depends on channel conditions, subcarrier assignment is attained through Elitist Selection Genetic Algorithm (ESGA), and rate allocation of each service is fulfilled by deducing two-way water filling principle. A new equivalent optimization objective function is proposed next as the simple evaluating index in ESGA to reduce complexity. Finally, simulations are carried out to verify the superiority and convergence of our scheme, as well as the applicability for different scenarios.;cs.IT
1801.01740;Analysis of a micro-macro acceleration method with minimum relative entropy moment matching;We analyse convergence of a micro-macro acceleration method for the Monte Carlo simulation of stochastic differential equations with time-scale separation between the (fast) evolution of individual trajectories and the (slow) evolution of the macroscopic function of interest. We consider a class of methods, presented in [Debrabant, K., Samaey, G., Zieli\'nski, P. A micro-macro acceleration method for the Monte Carlo simulation of stochastic differential equations. SINUM, 55 (2017) no. 6, 2745-2786], that performs short bursts of path simulations, combined with the extrapolation of a few macroscopic state variables forward in time. After extrapolation, a new microscopic state is then constructed, consistent with the extrapolated variable and minimising the perturbation caused by the extrapolation. In the present paper, we study a specific method in which this perturbation is minimised in a relative entropy sense. We discuss why relative entropy is a useful metric, both from a theoretical and practical point of view, and rigorously study local errors and numerical stability of the resulting method as a function of the extrapolation time step and the number of macroscopic state variables. Using these results, we discuss convergence to the full microscopic dynamics, in the limit when the extrapolation time step tends to zero and the number of macroscopic state variables tends to infinity.;math.NA
1801.01744;Volumes and Siegel-Veech constants of $\mathcal{H}(2g-2)$ and Hodge integrals;In the 80's H. Masur and W. Veech defined two numerical invariants of strata of abelian differentials: the volume and the Siegel-Veech constant. Based on numerical experiments, A. Eskin and A. Zorich proposed a series of conjectures for the large genus asymptotics of these invariants. By a careful analysis of the asymptotic behavior of quasi-modular forms, D. Chen, M. Moeller, and D. Zagier proved this conjecture for strata of differentials with simple zeros. Here, we prove that the conjecture holds for the other extreme case, i.e. for strata of differentials with a unique zero. Our main ingredient is the expression of the numerical invariants of these strata in terms of Hodge integrals on moduli spaces of curves.;math.AG
1801.01752;Improving the Secrecy of Distributed Storage Systems using Interference Alignment;Regenerating codes based on the approach of interference alignment for wireless interference channel achieve the cut-set bound for distributed storage systems. These codes provide data reliability, and perform efficient exact node repair when some node fails. Interference alignment as a concept is especially important to improve the repair efficiency of a failed node in a minimum storage regenerating (MSR) code. In addition it can improve the stored data security in presence of passive intruders. In this paper we construct a new code resilient against a threat model where a passive eavesdropper can access the data stored on a subset of nodes and the downloaded data during the repair process of a subset of failed nodes. We achieve an optimal secrecy capacity for the new explicit construction of MSR interference alignment code. Hence, we show that the eavesdropper obtains zero information from the original message stored across the distributed storage, and that we achieve a perfect secrecy.;cs.IT
1801.01754;Pseudo-Anosov maps with small stretch factors on punctured surfaces;Consider the problem of estimating the minimum entropy of pseudo-Anosov maps on a surface of genus $g$ with $n$ punctures. We determine the behaviour of this minimum number for a certain large subset of the $(g,n)$ plane, up to a multiplicative constant. In particular it has been shown that for fixed $n$, this minimum value behaves as $\frac{1}{g}$, proving what Penner speculated in 1991.;math.GT
1801.01761;Numerical Methods for Quasi-Periodic Incident Fields Scattered by Locally Perturbed Periodic Surfaces;Waves scattering from unbounded structures are always complicated problems for numerical simulations. For the case that the non-periodic incident field scattered by (locally perturbed) periodic surfaces, with the help of the Bloch transform, the problem could be solved by some finite element methods, if the incident fields decay at certain rate at the infinity. For faster decaying incident fields, a high order numerical method is also available. However, in these cases, the plain waves, which belong to a very important family of incident fields but do not decay at the infinity, are not included. In this paper, we aim to develop the Bloch transform based standard finite method for this certain case, and then establish the high order method afterwards. Numerical experiments have been carried out for both the standard and high order numerical methods. Based on the algorithms for incident plain waves, we could also extend the numerical methods to more generalized cases when only the not so efficient standard method is available.;math.NA
1801.01766;Right Circulant Matrices with Generalized Fibonacci and\ Lucas Polynomials and Coding Theory;In this paper, we give two new coding algorithms by means of right circulant matrices with elements generalized Fibonacci and Lucas polynomials. For this purpose, we study basic properties of right circulant matrices using generalized Fibonacci polynomials $F_{p,q,n}\left( x\right) $, generalized Lucas polynomials $L_{p,q,n}\left( x\right) $ and geometric sequences.;math.CO
1801.01770;Regularity Results of the Thin Obstacle Problem for the $p(x)$-Laplacian;We study thin obstacle problems involving the energy functional with $p(x)$-growth. We prove higher integrability and H\"{o}lder regularity for the gradient of minimizers of the thin obstacle problems under the assumption that the variable exponent $p(x)$ is H\"{o}lder continuous.;math.AP
1801.01774;Global solvability and boundedness in the $N$-dimensional quasilinear chemotaxis model with logistic source and consumption of chemoattractant;We consider the following chemotaxis model %fully parabolic Keller-Segel system with logistic source $$ \left\{\begin{array}{ll} u_t=\nabla\cdot(D(u)\nabla u)-\chi\nabla\cdot(u\nabla v)+\mu (u-u^2),\quad x\in \Omega, t&gt,0, \disp{v_t-\Delta v=-uv },\quad x\in \Omega, t&gt,0, %\disp{\tau w_t+\delta w=u },\quad %x\in \Omega, t&gt,0, \disp{(\nabla D(u)-\chi u\cdot \nabla v)\cdot \nu=\frac{\partial v}{\partial\nu}=0},\quad x\in \partial\Omega, t&gt,0, \disp{u(x,0)=u_0(x)},\quad v(x,0)=v_0(x),~~ x\in \Omega \end{array}\right. $$ on a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N(N\geq1)$, with smooth boundary $\partial\Omega, \chi$ and $\mu$ are positive constants. Besides appropriate smoothness assumptions, in this paper it is only required that $D(u)\geq C_{D}(u+1)^{m-1}$ for all $u\geq 0$ with some $C_{D} &gt, 0$ and some $$ m&gt,\left\{\begin{array}{ll} 1-\frac{\mu}{\chi[1+\lambda_{0}\|v_0\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}2^{3}]}~~\mbox{if}~~ N\leq2, % &gt,1+\frac{(N+2-2r)^+}{N+2}~~~~~~\mbox{if}~~ % \frac{N+2}{2}\geq r\geq\frac{N+2}{N}, 1~~~~~~\mbox{if}~~ N\geq3, \end{array}\right. $$ then for any sufficiently smooth initial data there exists a classical solution which is global in time and bounded, where $\lambda_{0}$ is a positive constant which is corresponding to the maximal sobolev regularity. The results of this paper extends the results of Jin (J. Diff. Eqns., 263(9)(2017), 5759-5772), who proved the possibility of boundness of weak solutions, in the case $m&gt,1$ and $N=3$.;math.AP

1801.01778;Remarks on the abelian convexity theorem;This note contains some observations on abelian convexity theorems. Convexity along an orbit is established in a very general setting using Kempf-Ness functions. This is applied to give short proofs of the Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg theorem and of abelian convexity for the gradient map in the case of a real analytic submanifold of complex projective space. Finally we give an application to the action on the probability measures.;math.DG
1801.01779;Logarithmic de Rham comparison for open rigid spaces;In this note, we prove the logarithmic $p$-adic comparison theorem for open rigid analytic varieties. We prove that a smooth rigid analytic variety with a strict simple normal crossing divisor is locally $K(\pi,1)$ (in a certain sense) with respect to $\mathbb{F}_p$-local systems and ramified coverings along the divisor. We follow Scholze's method to produce a pro-version of the Faltings site and use this site to prove a primitive comparison theorem in our setting. After introducing period sheaves in our setting, we prove aforesaid comparison theorem.;math.AG
1801.01780;Probabilistic max-plus schemes for solving Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations;We consider fully nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations associated to diffusion control problems involving a finite set-valued (or switching) control and possibly a continuum-valued control. In previous works (Akian, Fodjo, 2016 and 2017), we introduced a lower complexity probabilistic numerical algorithm for such equations by combining max-plus and numerical probabilistic approaches. The max-plus approach is in the spirit of the one of McEneaney, Kaise and Han (2011), and is based on the distributivity of monotone operators with respect to suprema. The numerical probabilistic approach is in the spirit of the one proposed by Fahim, Touzi and Warin (2011). A difficulty of the latter algorithm was in the critical constraints imposed on the Hamiltonian to ensure the monotonicity of the scheme, hence the convergence of the algorithm. Here, we present new probabilistic schemes which are monotone under rather weak assumptions, and show error estimates for these schemes. These estimates will be used in further works to study the probabilistic max-plus method.;math.OC
1801.01784;Vanishing Viscosity Limits of Scalar Equations with Degenerate Diffusivity;We consider a scalar, possibly degenerate parabolic equation with a source term, in several space dimensions. For initial data with bounded variation we prove the existence of solutions to the initial-value problem. Then we show that these solutions converge, in the vanishing-viscosity limit, to the Kruzhkov entropy solution of the corresponding hyperbolic equation. The proof exploits the H-measure compactness in several space dimensions.;math.AP
1801.01790;Multiple addition, deletion and restriction theorems for hyperplane arrangements;In the study of free arrangements, the most useful result to construct/check free arrangements is the addition-deletion theorem. Recently, the multiple version of the addition theorem is proved, called the multiple addition theorem (MAT) to prove the ideal-free theorem. The aim of this article is to give the deletion version of MAT, the multiple deletion theorem (MDT). Also, we can generalize MAT from the viewpoint of our new proof. Moreover, we introduce their restriction version, a multiple restriction theorem (MRT). Applications of them including the combinatorial freeness of the extended Catalan arrangements are given.;math.CO
1801.01795;Sparse highly connected spanning subgraphs in dense directed graphs;Mader proved that every strongly $k$-connected $n$-vertex digraph contains a strongly $k$-connected spanning subgraph with at most $2kn - 2k^2$ edges, where the equality holds for the complete bipartite digraph ${DK}_{k,n-k}$. For dense strongly $k$-connected digraphs, this upper bound can be significantly improved. More precisely, we prove that every strongly $k$-connected $n$-vertex digraph $D$ contains a strongly $k$-connected spanning subgraph with at most $kn + 800k(k+\overline{\Delta}(D))$ edges, where $\overline{\Delta}(D)$ denotes the maximum degree of the complement of the underlying undirected graph of a digraph $D$. Here, the additional term $800k(k+\overline{\Delta}(D))$ is tight up to multiplicative and additive constants. As a corollary, this implies that every strongly $k$-connected $n$-vertex semicomplete digraph contains a strongly $k$-connected spanning subgraph with at most $kn + 800k^2$ edges, which is essentially optimal since $800k^2$ cannot be reduced to the number less than $k(k-1)/2$. <br />We also prove an analogous result for strongly $k$-arc-connected directed multigraphs. Both proofs yield polynomial-time algorithms.;math.CO
1801.01796;Spatially Coupled Sparse Regression Codes: Design and State Evolution Analysis;We consider the design and analysis of spatially coupled sparse regression codes (SC-SPARCs), which were recently introduced by Barbier et al. for efficient communication over the additive white Gaussian noise channel. SC-SPARCs can be efficiently decoded using an Approximate Message Passing (AMP) decoder, whose performance in each iteration can be predicted via a set of equations called state evolution. In this paper, we give an asymptotic characterization of the state evolution equations for SC-SPARCs. For any given base matrix (that defines the coupling structure of the SC-SPARC) and rate, this characterization can be used to predict whether or not AMP decoding will succeed in the large system limit. We then consider a simple base matrix defined by two parameters $(\omega, \Lambda)$, and show that AMP decoding succeeds in the large system limit for all rates $R &lt, \mathcal{C}$. The asymptotic result also indicates how the parameters of the base matrix affect the decoding progression. Simulation results are presented to evaluate the performance of SC-SPARCs defined with the proposed base matrix.;cs.IT
1801.01797;Monte Carlo integration with a growing number of control variates;It is well known that Monte Carlo integration with variance reduction by means of control variates can be implemented by the ordinary least squares estimator for the intercept in a multiple linear regression model. A central limit theorem is established for the integration error if the number of control variates tends to infinity. The integration error is scaled by the standard deviation of the error term in the regression model. If the linear span of the control variates is dense in a function space that contains the integrand, the integration error tends to zero at a rate which is faster than the square root of the number of Monte Carlo replicates. Depending on the situation, increasing the number of control variates may or may not be computationally more efficient than increasing the Monte Carlo sample size.;math.ST
1801.01798;On the existence of an ultra central approximate identity for certain semigroup algebras;In this paper we characterize the existance of an ultra central approximate identity for $\ell^{1}(S)$, where $S$ is a uniformly locally finite inverse semigroup. As an application, for the Brandt semigroup $S=M^{0}(G,I)$ over a non-empty set $I$, we show that $\ell^{1}(S)$ has an ultra central approximate identity if and only if $I$ is finite.;math.FA
1801.01801;On a connectedness principle of Shokurov-Koll&#xe1,r type;Let $(X,\Delta)$ be a log pair over $S$, such that $-(K_X+\Delta)$ is nef over $S$. It is conjectured that the intersection of the non-klt (non Kawamata log terminal) locus of $(X,\Delta)$ with any fiber $X_s$ has at most two connected components. We prove this conjecture in dimension $\leq 4$ and in arbitrary dimension assuming the termination of klt flips.;math.AG
1801.01802;Neighborhood-Prime Labelings of Trees and Other Classes of Graphs;A neighborhood-prime labeling of a graph is a variation of a prime labeling in which the vertices are assigned labels from $1$ to $|V(G)|$ such that the $\gcd$ of the labels in the neighborhood of each non-degree $1$ vertex is equal to $1$. In this paper, we examine neighborhood-prime labelings of several classes of graphs such as polygonal snakes and books, with a focus on trees including caterpillars, spiders, and firecrackers.;math.CO
1801.01806;An elliptic boundary value problem for $G_{2}$ structures;We show that the $G_{2}$ holonomy equation on a manifold with boundary, with prescribed 3-form on the boundary, is elliptic. The main point is to set up a suitable linear elliptic boundary value problem. This result leads to a deformation theory. In particular we establish the existence of certain $G_{2}$ cobordisms between two small deformations of a Calabi-Yau 3-fold.;math.DG
1801.01808;On behavior of homeomorphisms with inverse modulus conditions;We consider some class of homeomorphisms of domains of Euclidean space, which are more general than quasiconformal mappings. For these homeomorphisms, we have obtained theorems on local behavior of it's inverse mappings in a given domain. Under some additional conditions, we proved results about behavior of mappings mentioned above in the closure of the domain.;math.MG
1801.01812;Horospheres in Teichm&#xfc,ller space and mapping class group;We study the geometry of horospheres in Teichm\"uller space of Riemann surfaces of genus g with n punctures, where $3g-3+n\geq 2$. We show that every $C^1$-diffeomorphism of Teichm\"uller space to itself that preserves horospheres is an element of the extended mapping class group. Using the relation between horospheres and metric balls, we obtain a new proof of Royden's Theorem that the isometry group of the Teichm\"uller metric is the extended mapping class group.;math.GT
1801.01813;On a numerical upper bound for the extended Goldbach conjecture;The Goldbach conjecture states that every even number can be decomposed as the sum of two primes. Let $D(N)$ denote the number of such prime decompositions for an even $N$. It is known that $D(N)$ can be bounded above by $$ D(N) \leq C^* \Theta(N), \quad \Theta(N):= \frac{N}{\log^2 N}\prod_{\substack{p|N p&gt,2}} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{p-2}\right)\prod_{p&gt,2}\left(1-\frac{1}{(p-1)^2}\right) $$ where $C^*$ denotes Chen's constant. It is conjectured that $C^*=2$. In 2004, Wu showed that $C^* \leq 7.8209$. We attempted to replicate his work in computing Chen's constant, and in doing so we provide an improved approximation of the Buchstab function $\omega(u)$, \begin{align*} \omega(u)=1/u, &amp, \quad (1\leq u\leq 2), (u \omega(u))'=\omega(u-1), &amp, \quad (u\geq 2). \end{align*} based on work done by Cheer and Goldston. For each interval $[j,j+1]$, they expressed $\omega(u)$ as a Taylor expansion about $u=j+1$. We expanded about the point $u=j+0.5$, so $\omega(u)$ was never evaluated more than $0.5$ away from the center of the Taylor expansion, which gave much stronger error bounds. <br />Issues arose while using this Taylor expansion to compute the required integrals for Chen's constant, so we proceeded with solving the above differential equation to obtain $\omega(u)$, and then integrating the result. Although the values that were obtained undershot Wu's results, we pressed on and refined Wu's work by discretising his integrals with finer granularity. The improvements to Chen's constant were negligible (as predicted by Wu). This provides experimental evidence, but not a proof, that were Wu's integrals computed on smaller intervals in exact form, the improvement to Chen's constant would be negligible. Thus, any substantial improvement on Chen's constant likely requires a radically different method to what Wu provided.;math.HO
1801.01816;Finding the seed of uniform attachment trees;A uniform attachment tree is a random tree that is generated dynamically. Starting from a fixed "seed" tree, vertices are added sequentially by attaching each vertex to an existing vertex chosen uniformly at random. Upon observing a large (unlabeled) tree, one wishes to find the initial seed. We investigate to what extent seed trees can be recovered, at least partially. We consider three types of seeds: a path, a star, and a random uniform attachment tree. We propose and analyze seed-finding algorithms for all three types of seed trees.;math.PR
1801.01819;Twisted arithmetic Siegel Weil formula on X0(N);In this paper, we study twisted arithmetic divisors on the modular curve X_0(N) with N square-free. For each pair (\Delta, r) where \Delta &gt,0 and \Delta \equiv r^2 \mod 4N, we constructed a twisted arithmetic theta function \phi_{\Delta, r}(\tau) which is a generating function of arithmetic twisted Heegner divisors. We prove the modularity of \phi_{\Delta, r}(\tau), along the way, we also identify the arithmetic pairing \langle \phi_{\Delta, r}(\tau),\widehat{\omega}_N \rangle with special value of some Eisenstein series, where \widehat{\omega}_N is a normalized metric Hodge line bundle.;math.NT
1801.01820;Design and Implementation of a Polar Codes Blind Detection Scheme;In blind detection, a set of candidates has to be decoded within a strict time constraint, to identify which transmissions are directed at the user equipment. Blind detection is required by the 3GPP LTE/LTE-Advanced standard, and it will be required in the 5th generation wireless communication standard (5G) as well. Polar codes have been selected for use in 5G: thus, the issue of blind detection of polar codes must be addressed. We propose a polar code blind detection scheme where the user ID is transmitted instead of some of the frozen bits. A first, coarse decoding phase helps selecting a subset of candidates that is decoded by a more powerful algorithm: an early stopping criterion is also introduced for the second decoding phase. Simulations results show good missed detection and false alarm rates, along with substantial latency gains thanks to early stopping. We then propose an architecture to implement the devised blind detection scheme, based on a tunable decoder that can be used for both phases. The architecture is synthesized and implementation results are reported for various system parameters. The reported area occupation and latency, obtained in 65 nm CMOS technology, are able to meet 5G requirements, and are guaranteed to meet them with even less resource usage in the latest technology nodes.;cs.IT
1801.01826;Compactifiable classes of compacta;We introduce the notion of compactifiable classes -- these are classes of metrizable compact spaces that can be up to homeomorphic copies ``disjointly combined'' into one metrizable compact space. This is witnessed by so-called compact composition of the class. Analogously, we consider Polishable classes and Polish compositions. The question of compactifiability or Polishability of a class is related to hyperspaces. Strongly compactifiable and strongly Polishable classes may be characterized by the existence of a corresponding family in the hyperspace of all metrizable compacta. We systematically study the introduced notions -- we give several characterizations, consider preservation under various constructions, and raise several questions.;math.GN
1801.01830;Multipliers in Bessel potential spaces. The case of different sign smooth indices;The objective of this paper is to describe the space of multipliers acting from a Bessel potential space $H^s_p(\mathbb R^n)$ into another space $H^{-t}_q(\mathbb R^n)$, provided that the smooth indices of these spaces have different signs, i.e. $s, t \geqslant 0$. This space of multipliers consists of distributions $u$, such that for all $\varphi \in H^s_p(\mathbb R^n)$ the product $\varphi \cdot u$ is well-defined and belongs to the space $H^{-t}_q(\mathbb R^n)$. We succeed to describe this space explicitly, provided that $p \leqslant q$ and one of the following conditions $$ s \geqslant t \geqslant 0, \ s &gt, n/p \ \ \, \text{or} \ \ \, t \geqslant s \geqslant 0, \ t &gt, n/q' \quad (\: \text{where} \, 1/q +1/q' = 1), $$ holds. In this case one has $$ M[H^s_p(\mathbb{R}^n) \to H^{-t}_{q}(\mathbb{R}^n)] = H^{-t}_{q, \: unif}(\mathbb{R}^n) \cap H^{-s}_{p', \: unif}(\mathbb{R}^n), $$ where $H^\gamma_{r, \: unif}(\mathbb{R}^n), \: \gamma \in \mathbb{R}, \: r &gt, 1$ is the scale of uniformly localized Bessel potential spaces. <br />In particular but important case $s = t &lt, n/\max (p,q')$ we prove two-sided continuous embeddings $$ H^{-s}_{r_1, \: unif}(\mathbb{R}^n) \subset M[H^s_p(\mathbb{R}^n) \to H^{-s}_q(\mathbb{R}^n)] \subset H^{-s}_{r_2, \: unif}(\mathbb{R}^n), $$ where $r_2 = \max (p', q), \ r_1 =[s/n-(1/p -1/q)]^{-1}$.;math.FA
1801.01833;Seymour&#x27,s conjecture on 2-connected graphs of large pathwidth;We prove the conjecture of Seymour (1993) that for every apex-forest $H_1$ and outerplanar graph $H_2$ there is an integer $p$ such that every 2-connected graph of pathwidth at least $p$ contains $H_1$ or $H_2$ as a minor. An independent proof was recently obtained by Dang and Thomas.;math.CO
1801.01838;A Bramble-Pasciak conjugate gradient method for discrete Stokes equations with random viscosity;We study the iterative solution of linear systems of equations arising from stochastic Galerkin finite element discretizations of saddle point problems. We focus on the Stokes model with random data parametrized by uniformly distributed random variables and discuss well-posedness of the variational formulations. We introduce a Bramble-Pasciak conjugate gradient method as a linear solver. It builds on a non-standard inner product associated with a block triangular preconditioner. The block triangular structure enables more sophisticated preconditioners than the block diagonal structure usually applied in MINRES methods. We show how the existence requirements of a conjugate gradient method can be met in our setting. We analyze the performance of the solvers depending on relevant physical and numerical parameters by means of eigenvalue estimates. For this purpose, we derive bounds for the eigenvalues of the relevant preconditioned sub-matrices. We illustrate our findings using the flow in a driven cavity as a numerical test case, where the viscosity is given by a truncated Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion of a random field. In this example, a Bramble-Pasciak conjugate gradient method with block triangular preconditioner outperforms a MINRES method with block diagonal preconditioner in terms of iteration numbers.;math.NA
1801.01839;Characterization of rational matrices that admit finite digit representations;Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ matrix with rational entries and let \[ \mathbb{Z}^n[A] := \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( \mathbb{Z}^n + A\mathbb{Z}^n + \dots + A^{k-1}\mathbb{Z}^n\right) \] be the minimal $A$-invariant $\mathbb{Z}$-module containing the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$. If $\mathcal{D}\subset\mathbb{Z}^n[A]$ is a finite set we call the pair $(A,\mathcal{D})$ a digit system. We say that $(A,\mathcal{D})$ has the finiteness property if each $\mathbf{z} \in \mathbb{Z}^n[A]$ can be written in the form \[ \mathbf{z} = \mathbf{d}_0 + A\mathbf{d}_1 + \dots + A^k\mathbf{d}_k, \] with $k\in\mathbb{N}$ and digits $\mathbf{d}_j \in \mathcal{D}$ for $0\le j\le k$. We prove that for a given matrix $A \in M_n(\mathbb{Q})$ there is a finite set $\mathcal{D}\subset\mathbb{Z}^n[A]$ such that $(A, \mathcal{D})$ has the finiteness property if and only if $A$ has no eigenvalue of absolute value $&lt, 1$. This result is the matrix analogue of the height reducing property of algebraic numbers. In proving this result we also characterize integer polynomials $P \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ that admit digit systems having the finiteness property in the quotient ring $\mathbb{Z}[x]/(P)$.;math.NT
1801.01850;Hyperbolic HHS II: Graphs of hierarchically hyperbolic groups;In this paper we consider a large family of graphs of hierarchically hyperbolic groups (HHG) and show that their fundamental groups admit HHG structures. To do that, we will investigate the notion of hierarchical quasi convexity and show that for a hyperbolic HHS it coincides with the notion of quasi-convexity. The main technical result, for which we expect further applications, is that it is possible to incorporate the HHG structure of a hierarchically hyperbolically embedded subgroup into the HHG structure of the ambient group. This generalizes and provides some additional details to a procedure described in [DHS17].;math.GR
1801.01857;On the Kahler-Einstein metric at strictly pseudoconvex points;We prove a local boundary regularity result for the complete Kahler-Einstein metrics of negative Ricci curvature near strictly pseudoconvex boundary point. We also study the asymptotic behaviour of their holomorphic bisectional curvatures near such points.;math.DG
1801.01858;Special moves for open book decompositions of 3-manifolds;We provide a complete set of two moves that suffice to relate any two open book decompositions of a given 3-manifold. One of the moves is the usual plumbing with a positive or negative Hopf band, while the other one is a special local version of Harer's twisting, which is presented in two different (but stably equivalent) forms. Our approach relies on 4-dimensional Lefschetz fibrations, and on 3-dimensional contact topology, via the Giroux-Goodman stable equivalence theorem for open book decompositions representing homologous contact structures.;math.GT
1801.01859;The Arbitrarily Varying Relay Channel;We study the arbitrarily varying relay channel, and establish the cutset bound and partial decode-forward bound on the random code capacity. We further determine the random code capacity for special cases. Then, we consider conditions under which the deterministic code capacity is determined as well.;cs.IT
1801.01860;Controllability of the Navier-Stokes equation in a rectangle with a little help of a distributed phantom force;We consider the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation in a rectangle with the usual no-slip boundary condition prescribed on the upper and lower boundaries. We prove that for any positive time, for any finite energy initial data, there exist controls on the left and right boundaries and a distributed force, which can be chosen arbitrarily small in any Sobolev norm in space, such that the corresponding solution is at rest at the given final time. <br />Our work improves earlier results where the distributed force is small only in a negative Sobolev space. It is a further step towards an answer to Jacques-Louis Lions' question about the small-time global exact boundary controllability of the Navier-Stokes equation with the no-slip boundary condition, for which no distributed force is allowed. <br />Our analysis relies on the well-prepared dissipation method already used for Burgers and for Navier-Stokes in the case of the Navier slip-with-friction boundary condition. In order to handle the larger boundary layers associated with the no-slip boundary condition, we perform a preliminary regularization into analytic functions with arbitrarily large analytic radius and prove a long-time nonlinear Cauchy-Kovalevskaya estimate relying only on horizontal analyticity.;math.AP
1801.01864;An asymptotic bound for Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of certain Ext modules over graded complete intersection rings;Set $ A := Q/({\bf z}) $, where $ Q $ is a polynomial ring over a field, and $ {\bf z} = z_1,\ldots,z_c $ is a homogeneous $ Q $-regular sequence. Let $ M $ and $ N $ be finitely generated graded $ A $-modules, and $ I $ be a homogeneous ideal of $ A $. We show that <br />(1) $ \mathrm{reg}\left( \mathrm{Ext}_A^{i}(M, I^nN) \right) \le \rho_N(I) \cdot n - f \cdot \left\lfloor \frac{i}{2} \right\rfloor + b \mbox{ for all } i, n \ge 0 $, <br />(2) $ \mathrm{reg}\left( \mathrm{Ext}_A^{i}(M,N/I^nN) \right) \le \rho_N(I) \cdot n - f \cdot \left\lfloor \frac{i}{2} \right\rfloor + b' \mbox{ for all } i, n \ge 0 $, <br />where $ b $ and $ b' $ are some constants, $ f := \mathrm{min}\{ \mathrm{deg}(z_j) : 1 \le j \le c \} $, and $ \rho_N(I) $ is an invariant defined in terms of reduction ideals of $ I $ with respect to $ N $. There are explicit examples which show that these inequalities are sharp.;math.AC
1801.01866;The Reeb Graph Edit Distance is Universal;We consider the setting of Reeb graphs of piecewise linear functions and study distances between them that are stable, meaning that functions which are similar in the supremum norm ought to have similar Reeb graphs. We define an edit distance for Reeb graphs and prove that it is stable and universal, meaning that it provides an upper bound to any other stable distance. In contrast, via a specific construction, we show that the interleaving distance and the functional distortion distance on Reeb graphs are not universal.;math.AT
1801.01867;Limit-Periodic Schr&#xf6,dinger Operators With Lipschitz Continuous IDS;We show that there exist limit-periodic Schr\"odinger operators such that the associated integrated density of states is Lipschitz continuous. These operators arise in the inverse spectral theoretic KAM approach of P\"oschel.;math.SP
1801.01868;Multiplicity results and qualitative properties for semilinear elliptic problems with Neumann boundary conditions;In this paper we study multiplicity and qualitative behavior of solutions for semilinear elliptic problems with neumann boundary condition and asymptotically linear smooth nonlinearity. We provide sufficient conditions on the number of eigenvalues the derivative of the nonlinearity crosses to guarantee existence of at least five nontrivial solutions. The techniques we use are a combination of minimization, Leray-Schauder degree, Morse Theory and Reduction method a la Castro-Lazer.;math.AP
1801.01873;When is $X\times Y$ homeomorphic to $X\times_l Y$?;We identify a class of linearly ordered topological spaces $X$ that may satisfy the property that $X\times X$ is homeomorphic to $X\times_l X$ or can be embedded into a linearly ordered space with the stated property. We justify the conjectures by partial results.;math.GN
1801.01875;Near Optimal Coded Data Shuffling for Distributed Learning;Data shuffling between distributed cluster of nodes is one of the critical steps in implementing large-scale learning algorithms. Randomly shuffling the data-set among a cluster of workers allows different nodes to obtain fresh data assignments at each learning epoch. This process has been shown to provide improvements in the learning process. However, the statistical benefits of distributed data shuffling come at the cost of extra communication overhead from the master node to worker nodes, and can act as one of the major bottlenecks in the overall time for computation. There has been significant recent interest in devising approaches to minimize this communication overhead. One approach is to provision for extra storage at the computing nodes. The other emerging approach is to leverage coded communication to minimize the overall communication overhead. <br />The focus of this work is to understand the fundamental trade-off between the amount of storage and the communication overhead for distributed data shuffling. In this work, we first present an information theoretic formulation for the data shuffling problem, accounting for the underlying problem parameters (number of workers, $K$, number of data points, $N$, and the available storage, $S$ per node). We then present an information theoretic lower bound on the communication overhead for data shuffling as a function of these parameters. We next present a novel coded communication scheme and show that the resulting communication overhead of the proposed scheme is within a multiplicative factor of at most $\frac{K}{K-1}$ from the information-theoretic lower bound. Furthermore, we present the aligned coded shuffling scheme for some storage values, which achieves the optimal storage vs communication trade-off for $K&lt,5$, and further reduces the maximum multiplicative gap down to $\frac{K-\frac{1}{3}}{K-1}$, for $K\geq 5$.;cs.IT
1801.01878;A rank 2 Dijkgraaf-Moore-Verlinde-Verlinde formula;We conjecture a formula for the virtual elliptic genera of moduli spaces of rank 2 sheaves on minimal surfaces $S$ of general type. We express our conjecture in terms of the Igusa cusp form $\chi_{10}$ and Borcherds type lifts of three quasi-Jacobi forms which are all related to the Weierstrass elliptic function. We also conjecture that the generating function of virtual cobordism classes of these moduli spaces depends only on $\chi(\mathcal{O}_S)$ and $K_S^2$ via two universal functions, one of which is determined by the cobordism classes of Hilbert schemes of points on $K3$. We present generalizations of these conjectures, e.g. to arbitrary surfaces with $p_g&gt,0$ and $b_1=0$. <br />We use a result of J. Shen to express the virtual cobordism class in terms of descendent Donaldson invariants. In a prequel we used T. Mochizuki's formula, universality, and toric calculations to compute such Donaldson invariants in the setting of virtual $\chi_y$-genera. Similar techniques allow us to verify our new conjectures in many cases.;math.AG
1801.01897;Power Kripke-Platek set theory and the axiom of choice;Whilst Power Kripke-Platek set theory, KPP, shares many properties with ordinary Kripke-Platek set theory, KP, in several ways it behaves quite differently from KP. This is perhaps most strikingly demonstrated by a result, due to Mathias, to the effect that adding the axiom of constructibility to KPP gives rise to a much stronger theory, whereas in the case of KP the constructible hierarchy provides an inner model, so that KP and KP+V=L have the same strength. This paper will be concerned with the relationship between KPP and KPP plus the axiom of choice or even the global axiom of choice, GAC. Since L is the standard vehicle to furnish a model in which this axiom holds, the usual argument for demonstrating that the addition of AC or GAC to KPP does not increase proof-theoretic strength does not apply in any obvious way. Among other tools, the paper uses techniques from ordinal analysis to show that KPP+GAC has the same strength as KPP, thereby answering a question of Mathias. Moreover, it is shown that KPP+GAC is conservative over KPP for Pi-1-4 statements of analysis. The method of ordinal analysis for theories with power set was developed in an earlier paper. The technique allows one to compute witnessing information from infinitary proofs, providing bounds for the transfinite iterations of the power set operation that are provable in a theory. As the theory KPP+GAC provides a very useful tool for defining models and realizability models of other theories that are hard to construct without access to a uniform selection mechanism, it is desirable to determine its exact proof-theoretic strength. This knowledge can for instance be used to determine the strength of Feferman's operational set theory with power set operation as well as constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice.;math.LO
1801.01898;Natural proof of the characterization of relatively compact families in $L^p-$spaces on locally compact groups;In the paper we look for an elegant proof of the characterization of relatively compact families in $L^p-$spaces. At first glance, the suggested approach may seem convoluted and lengthy, but we spare no effort to argue that our proof is in fact more natural than the ones existent in the literature. The key idea is that the three properties which characterize relative compactness in $L^p-$spaces ($L^p-$boundedness, $L^p-$equicontinuity and $L^p-$equivanishing) are "preserved" (or rather "inherited") when the family $\Ffamily\subset L^p$ is convolved with a continuous and compactly supported function. This new family turns out to be relatively compact in $C_0-$space and it remains to be demonstrated that relative compactness in $C_0-$space implies relative compactness of the original family $\Ffamily.$;math.FA
1801.01906;Rankin-Cohen brackets and Serre derivatives as Poincar&#xe9, series;We give expressions for the Serre derivatives of Eisenstein and Poincar\'e series as well as their Rankin-Cohen brackets with arbitrary modular forms in terms of the Poincar\'e averaging construction, and derive several identities for the Ramanujan tau function as applications.;math.NT
1801.01908;Structural Logic and Abstract Elementary Classes with Intersection;We give a syntactic characterization of abstract elementary classes (AECs) closed under intersections using a new logic with a quantifier for isomorphism types that we call structural logic: we prove that AECs with intersections correspond to classes of models of a universal theory in structural logic. This generalizes Tarski's syntactic characterization of universal classes. As a corollary, we obtain that any AEC with countable L\"owenheim-Skolem number is axiomatizable in $\mathbb{L}_{\infty, \omega} (Q)$, where $Q$ is the quantifier "there exists uncountably many".;math.LO
1801.01911;Descriptive Cellular Homology;This article introduces descriptive cellular homology on cell complexes, which is an extension of J.H.C. Whitehead's CW topology. A main result is that a descriptive cellular complex is a topology on fibres in a fibre bundle. An application of two forms of cellular homology is given in terms of the persistence of shapes in CW spaces.;math.GT
1801.01915;An application of the partial r-Bell polynomials on some family of bivariate polynomials;The aim of this paper is to give some combinatorial relations linked polynomials generalizing those of Appell type to the partial r-Bell polynomials. We give an inverse relation, recurrence relations involving some family of polynomials and their exact expressions at rational values in terms of the partial r-Bell polynomials. We illustrate the obtained results by various comprehensive examples.;math.CO
1801.01917;Multiplicative operators in the spectral problem of integrable systems;We consider the spectral problem of the Lax pair associated to periodic integrable partial differential equations. We assume this spectral problem to be a polynomial of degree $d$ in the spectral parameter $\lambda$. From this assumption, we find the conservation laws as well as the hyperelliptic curve required to solve the periodic inverse problem. A recursion formula is developed, as well as $d$ additional conditions which give additional information to integrate the equations under consideration. We also include two examples to show how the techniques developed work. For the Korteweg-deVries (KdV) equation, the degree of the multiplicative equation is $d=1$. Hence, we only have one condition and one recursion formula. The condition gives in each degree of the recursion the conserved densities for KdV equation, recovering the Lax hierarchy. For the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation, the degree of the multiplicative operator is $d=2$. Hence, we have a couple of conditions that we use to deduce conserved density constants and the Lax hierarchy for such equation. Additionally, we explicitely write down the hyper-elliptic curve associted to the NLS equation. Our approach can be use for other completely integrable differential equations, as long as we have a polynomial multiplicative operator associated to them.;math.AP
1801.01918;Homogenization of some degenerate pseudoparabolic variational inequalities;Multiscale analysis of a degenerate pseudoparabolic variational inequality, modelling the two-phase flow with dynamical capillary pressure in a perforated domain, is the main topic of this work. Regularisation and penalty operator methods are applied to show the existence of a solution of the nonlinear degenerate pseudoparabolic variational inequality defined in a domain with microscopic perforations, as well as to derive a priori estimates for solutions of the microscopic problem. The main challenge is the derivation of a priori estimates for solutions of the variational inequality, uniformly with respect to the regularisation parameter and to the small parameter defining the scale of the microstructure. The method of two-scale convergence is used to derive the corresponding macroscopic obstacle problem.;math.AP
1801.01924;Green matrix estimates of block Jacobi matrices I: Unbounded gap in the essential spectrum;This work deals with decay bounds for Green matrices and generalized eigenvectors of block Jacobi matrices when the real part of the spectral parameter lies in an infinite gap of the operator's essential spectrum. We consider the cases of commutative and noncommutative matrix entries separately. An example of a block Jacobi operator with noncommutative entries and nonnegative essential spectrum is given to illustrate the results.;math-ph
1801.01925;The reciprocal sum of primitive nondeficient numbers;We investigate the reciprocal sum of primitive nondeficient numbers, or pnds. In 1934, Erdos showed that the reciprocal sum of pnds converges, which he used to prove that the abundant numbers have a natural density. We show the reciprocal sum of pnds is between 0.348 and 0.380.;math.NT
1801.01931;Magnetic oscillations in a model of graphene;We consider a quantum graph as a model of graphene in constant magnetic field and describe the density of states in terms of relativistic Landau levels satisfying a Bohr--Sommerfeld quantization condition. That provides semiclassical corrections (with the magnetic flux as the semiclassical parameter) in the study of magnetic oscillations.;math-ph
1801.01934;Universality results for kinetically constrained spin models in two dimensions;Kinetically constrained models (KCM) are reversible interacting particle systems on $\mathbb Z^d$ with continuous time Markov dynamics of Glauber type, which represent a natural stochastic (and non-monotone) counterpart of the family of cellular automata known as $\mathcal U$-bootstrap percolation. KCM also display some of the peculiar features of the so-called "glassy dynamics", and as such they are extensively used in the physics literature to model the liquid-glass transition, a major and longstanding open problem in condensed matter physics. <br />We consider two-dimensional KCM with update rule $\mathcal U$, and focus on proving universality results for the mean infection time of the origin, in the same spirit as those recently established in the setting of $\mathcal U$-bootstrap percolation. We first identify what we believe are the correct universality classes, which turn out to be different from those of $\mathcal U$-bootstrap percolation. We then prove universal upper bounds on the mean infection time within each class, which we conjecture to be sharp up to logarithmic corrections. In certain cases, including all supercritical models, and the well-known Duarte model, our conjecture has recently been confirmed in [MMT]. In fact, in these cases our upper bound is sharp up to a constant factor in the exponent. For certain classes of update rules, it turns out that the infection time of the KCM diverges much faster than for the corresponding $\mathcal U$-bootstrap process when the equilibrium density of infected sites goes to zero. This is due to the occurrence of energy barriers which determine the dominant behaviour for KCM, but which do not matter for the monotone bootstrap dynamics.;math.PR
1801.01938;A note on Arithmetic Diophantine series;We consider some asymptotic analysis for series related to the work of Hardy and Littlewood on Diophantine approximation, as well as Davenport. In particular, we expand on ideas from some previous work on arithmetic series and the RH.;math.NT
1801.01940;A spiral interface with positive Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman limit at the origin;We give an example of a pair of nonnegative subharmonic functions with disjoint support for which the Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman monotonicity formula has strictly positive limit at the origin, and yet the interface between their supports lacks a (unique) tangent there. This clarifies a remark appearing in the literature (see \cite{cs05}) that the positivity of the limit of the ACF formula implies unique tangents, this is true under some additional assumptions, but false in general. In our example, blow-ups converge to the expected piecewise linear two-plane function along subsequences, but the limiting function depends on the subsequence due to the spiraling nature of the interface.;math.AP
1801.01942;Vanishing theorems for representation homology and the derived cotangent complex;Let $G$ be a reductive affine algebraic group defined over a field $k$ of characteristic zero. In this paper, we study the cotangent complex of the derived $G$-representation scheme $ {\rm DRep}_G(X)$ of a pointed connected topological space $X$. We use an (algebraic version of) unstable Adams spectral sequence relating the cotangent homology of $ {\rm DRep}_G(X) $ to the representation homology $ {\rm HR}_*(X,G) := \pi_*{\mathcal O}[{\rm DRep}_G(X)] $ to prove some vanishing theorems for groups and geometrically interesting spaces. Our examples include virtually free groups, Riemann surfaces, link complements in $ {\mathbb R}^3 $ and generalized lens spaces. In particular, for any f.g. virtually free group $ \Gamma $, we show that $\, {\rm HR}_i({\rm B}\Gamma, G) = 0 \,$ for all $ i &gt, 0 $. For a closed Riemann surface $\Sigma_g $ of genus $ g \ge 1 $, we have $\, {\rm HR}_i(\Sigma_g, G) = 0 \,$ for all $ i &gt, \dim G $. The sharp vanishing bounds for $ \Sigma_g $ depend actually on the genus: we conjecture that if $ g = 1 $, then $\, {\rm HR}_i(\Sigma_g, G) = 0 \,$ for $ i &gt, {\rm rank}\,G $, and if $ g \ge 2 $, then $\, {\rm HR}_i(\Sigma_g, G) = 0 \,$ for $ i &gt, \dim\,{\mathcal Z}(G) \,$, where $ {\mathcal Z}(G) $ is the center of $G$. We prove these bounds locally on the smooth locus of the representation scheme $ {\rm Rep}_G[\pi_1(\Sigma_g)]\,$ in the case of complex connected reductive groups. One important consequence of our results is the existence of a well-defined $K$-theoretic virtual fundamental class for $ {\rm DRep}_G(X)$ in the sense of Ciocan-Fontanine and Kapranov. We give a new `Tor formula' for this class in terms of functor homology.;math.AT
1801.01945;Quadrilaterals inscribed in convex curves;We classify the set of quadrilaterals that can be inscribed in convex Jordan curves, in the continuous as well as in the smooth case. This answers a question of Makeev in the special case of convex curves. The difficulty of this problem comes from the fact that standard topological arguments to prove the existence of solutions do not apply here due to the lack of sufficient symmetry. Instead, the proof makes use of an area argument of Karasev and Tao, which we furthermore simplify and elaborate on. The continuous case requires an additional analysis of the singular points, and a small miracle, which then extends to show that the problems of inscribing isosceles trapezoids in smooth curves and in piecewise $C^1$ curves are equivalent.;math.MG
1801.01962;Expansion of Iterated Stratonovich Stochastic Integrals of Multiplicity 2 Based on Double Fourier-Legendre Series Summarized by Pringsheim Method;The article is devoted to the expansion of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of second multiplicity into the double series of products of standard Gaussian random variables. The proof of expansion is based on the application of double Fourier-Legendre series summarized by Pringsheim method. The results of the article can be applied to the numerical integration of Ito stochastic differential equations.;math.PR
1801.01963;Cluster algebra structures on Poisson nilpotent algebras;Various coordinate rings of varieties appearing in the theory of Poisson Lie groups and Poisson homogeneous spaces belong to the large, axiomatically defined class of symmetric Poisson nilpotent algebras, e.g. coordinate rings of Schubert cells for symmetrizable Kac--Moody groups. We prove that every Poisson nilpotent algebra satisfying a mild condition on certain scalars is canonically isomorphic to a cluster algebra which coincides with the corresponding upper cluster algebra, without additional localizations by frozen variables. The constructed cluster structure is compatible with the Poisson structure in the sense of Gekhtman, Shapiro and Vainshtein. All Poisson nilpotent algebras are proved to be equivariant Poisson Unique Factorization Domains. Their seeds are constructed from sequences of Poisson-prime elements for chains of Poisson UFDs, mutation matrices are effectively determined from linear systems in terms of the underlying Poisson structure. Uniqueness, existence, mutation, and other properties are established for these sequences of Poisson-prime elements.;math.AC
1801.01965;Restrictions on Potential Automatic Structures on Thompson&#x27,s Group F;We show that a large class of languages in the standard finite generating set X = {$x_0, x_1, x_0^{-1}, x_1^{-1}$} cannot be part of an automatic structure for Thompson's Group F. These languages are ones that accept at least one representative of each element of F of word length that is within a fixed constant of a geodesic representative of the element. To accomplish this, we look at a specific element of F and trace two different paths through the Cayley graph to that element. We show that staying within the length restrictions along these two paths would force that element to have contradictory properties.;math.GR
1801.01975;A construction of sequentially Cohen-Macaulay graphs;For every simple graph $G$, a class of multiple clique cluster-whiskered graphs $G^{md}$ is introduced, and it is shown that all graphs $G^{md}$ are vertex decomposable, thus the independence simplicial complex ${\rm Ind}\,G^{md}$ is sequentially Cohen-Macaulay, the properties of the graphs $G^{md}$ and the clique-whiskered graph $G^\pi$ are studied, including the enumeration of facets of the complex ${\rm Ind}\, G^{\pi}$ and, the calculation of Betti numbers of the cover ideal $I_c(G^{md})$.;math.AC
1801.01976;Standing waves for quasilinear Schr&#xf6,inger equations with indefinite potentials;We consider quasilinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ of the form% \[ -\Delta u+V(x)u-u\Delta(u^{2})=g(u)\text{,}% \] where $g(u)$ is $4$-superlinear. Unlike all known results in the literature, the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $-\Delta+V$ is allowed to be indefinite, hence the variational functional does not satisfy the mountain pass geometry. By a local linking argument and Morse theory, we obtain a nontrivial solution for the problem. In case that $g$ is odd, we get an unbounded sequence of solutions.;math.AP
1801.01977;On varieties of groups generated by wreath products of abelian groups;Generalizing results of Higman and Houghton on varieties generated by wreath products of finite cycles, we prove that the (direct or cartesian) wreath product of arbitrary abelian groups $A$ and $B$ generates the product variety $var (A) \cdot var (B)$ if and only if one of the groups $A$ and $B$ is not of finite exponent, or if $A$ and $B$ are of finite exponents $m$ and $n$ respectively and for all primes $p$ dividing both $m$ and $n$, the factors $B[p^k]/B[p^{k-1}]$ are infinite, where $B[s]=\langle b\in B|\,b^{s}=1 \rangle$ and where $p^k$ is the highest power of $p$ dividing $n$.;math.GR
1801.01978;Trainable ISTA for Sparse Signal Recovery;In this paper, we propose a novel sparse signal recovery algorithm called Trainable ISTA (TISTA). The proposed algorithm consists of two estimation units such as a linear estimation unit and a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimator-based shrinkage unit. The estimated error variance required in the MMSE shrinkage unit is precisely estimated from a tentative estimate of the original signal. The remarkable feature of the proposed scheme is that TISTA includes adjustable variables controlling a step size and the error variance for the MMSE shrinkage. The variables are adjusted by standard deep learning techniques. The number of trainable variables of TISTA is equal to the number of iteration rounds and it is much smaller than that of known learnable sparse signal recovery algorithms. This feature leads to highly stable and fast training processes of TISTA. Computer experiments show that TISTA is applicable to various classes of sensing matrices such as Gaussian matrices, binary matrices and matrices with large condition numbers. Numerical results also demonstrate that TISTA shows significantly faster convergence than those of AMP and LISTA in many cases.;cs.IT
1801.01982;Refinements of Levenshtein bounds in $q$-ary Hamming spaces;We develop refinements of the Levenshtein bound in $q$-ary Hamming spaces by taking into account the discrete nature of the distances versus the continuous behavior of certain parameters used by Levenshtein. The first relevant cases are investigated in detail and new bounds are presented. In particular, we derive generalizations and $q$-ary analogs of a MacEliece bound. We provide evidence that our approach is as good as the complete linear programming and discuss how faster are our calculations. Finally, we present a table with parameters of codes which, if exist, would attain our bounds.;cs.IT
1801.01985;Algebraic curves $A^{\circ l}(x)-U(y)=0$ and arithmetic of orbits of rational functions;We give a description of pairs of complex rational functions $A$ and $U$ of degree at least two such that for every $d\geq 1$ the algebraic curve $A^{\circ d}(x)-U(y)=0$ has a factor of genus zero or one. In particular, we show that if $A$ is not a `generalized Latt\`es map', then this condition is satisfied if and only if there exists a rational function $V$ such that $U\circ V=A^{\circ l}$ for some $l\geq 1.$ We also prove a version of the dynamical Mordell-Lang conjecture, concerning intersections of orbits of points from $\mathbb P^1(K)$ under iterates of $A$ with the value set $U(\mathbb P^1(K))$, where $A$ and $U$ are rational functions defined over a number field $K.$;math.DS
1801.01992;Locally convex spaces and Schur type properties;In the main result of the paper we extend Rosenthal's characterization of Banach spaces with the Schur property by showing that for a quasi-complete locally convex space $E$ whose separable bounded sets are metrizable the following conditions are equivalent: (1) $E$ has the Schur property, (2) $E$ and $E_w$ have the same sequentially compact sets, where $E_w$ is the space $E$ with the weak topology, (3) $E$ and $E_w$ have the same compact sets, (4) $E$ and $E_w$ have the same countably compact sets, (5) $E$ and $E_w$ have the same pseudocompact sets, (6) $E$ and $E_w$ have the same functionally bounded sets, (7) every bounded non-precompact sequence in $E$ has a subsequence which is equivalent to the unit basis of $\ell_1$ and (8) every bounded non-precompact sequence in $E$ has a subsequence which is discrete and $C$-embedded in $E_w$.;math.FA
1801.01994;The proximal alternating direction method of multipliers in the nonconvex setting: convergence analysis and rates;We propose two numerical algorithms in the fully nonconvex setting for the minimization of the sum of a smooth function and the composition of a nonsmooth function with a linear operator. The iterative schemes are formulated in the spirit of the proximal alternating direction method of multipliers and its linearized variant, respectively. The proximal terms are introduced via variable metrics, a fact which allows us to derive new proximal splitting algorithms for nonconvex structured optimization problems, as particular instances of the general schemes. Under mild conditions on the sequence of variable metrics and by assuming that a regularization of the associated augmented Lagrangian has the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property, we prove that the iterates converge to a KKT point of the objective function. By assuming that the augmented Lagrangian has the Lojasiewicz property, we also derive convergence rates for both the augmented Lagrangian and the iterates.;math.OC
1801.01998;On locally compact semitopological graph inverse semigroups;In this paper we investigate locally compact semitopological graph inverse semigroups. Our main result is the following: if a directed graph $E$ is strongly connected and contains a finite amount of vertices then a locally compact semitopological graph inverse semigroup $G(E)$ is either compact or discrete. This result generalizes results of Gutik and Bardyla who proved the above dichotomy for locally compact semitopological polycyclic monoids $\mathcal{P}_1$ and $\mathcal{P}_{\lambda}$, respectively.;math.GN
1801.02002;Antipodal sets in infinite dimensional Banach spaces;The following strengthening of the Elton-Odell theorem on the existence of a $(1+\epsilon)-$separated sequences in the unit sphere $S_X$ of an infinite dimensional Banach space $X$ is proved: There exists an infinite subset $S\subseteq S_X$ and a constant $d&gt,1$, satisfying the property that for every $x,y\in S$ with $x\neq y$ there exists $f\in B_{X^*}$ such that $d\leq f(x)-f(y)$ and $f(y)\leq f(z)\leq f(x)$, for all $z\in S$.;math.FA
1801.02006;Products of locally compact spaces are k_R-spaces;A theorem by Norman L. Noble from 1970 asserts that every product of completely regular, locally pseudo-compact k_R-spaces is a k_R-space. As a consequence, all direct products of locally compact Hausdorff spaces are k_R-spaces. We provide a streamlined proof for this fact.;math.GN
1801.02008;Recovery of an embedded obstacle and the surrounding medium for Maxwell&#x27,s system;In this paper, we are concerned with the inverse electromagnetic scattering problem of recovering a complex scatterer by the corresponding electric far-field data. The complex scatterer consists of an inhomogeneous medium and a possibly embedded perfectly electric conducting (PEC) obstacle. The far-field data are collected corresponding to incident plane waves with a fixed incident direction and a fixed polarisation, but frequencies from an open interval. It is shown that the embedded obstacle can be uniquely recovered by the aforementioned far-field data, independent of the surrounding medium. Furthermore, if the surrounding medium is piecewise homogeneous, then the medium can be recovered as well. Those unique recovery results are new to the literature. Our argument is based on low-frequency expansions of the electromagnetic fields and certain harmonic analysis techniques.;math.AP
1801.02009;Probabilistic DHP Adaptive Critic for Nonlinear Stochastic Control Systems;Following the recently developed algorithms for fully probabilistic control design for general dynamic stochastic systems [15], [18], this paper presents the solution to the probabilistic dual heuristic programming (DHP) adaptive critic method [15] and randomized control algorithm for stochastic nonlinear dynamical systems. The purpose of the randomized control input design is to make the joint probability density function of the closed loop system as close as possible to a predetermined ideal joint probability density function. This paper completes the previous work [15], [18] by formulating and solving the fully probabilistic control design problem on the more general case of nonlinear stochastic discrete time systems. A simulated example is used to demonstrate the use of the algorithm and encouraging results have been obtained.;math.OC
1801.02010;On decoding procedures of intertwining codes;One of the main weakness of the family of centralizer codes is that its length is always $n^2$. Thus we have taken a new matrix equation code called intertwining code. Specialty of this code is the length of it, which is of the form $nk$. We establish two decoding methods which can be fitted to intertwining codes as well as for any linear codes. We also show an inclusion of linear codes into a special class of intertwining codes.;cs.IT
1801.02011;Wave model of the regular Sturm-Liouville operator;We describe the wave functional model for the minimal (symmetric) Sturm-Liouville operator on the finite interval. We construct the wave spectrum of this operator, then, following the abstract scheme, we construct the model space of functions on the wave spectrum and introduce in that space the model operator. The latter is a matrix Sturm-Liouville operator which is unitarily equivalent to the original.;math-ph
1801.02012;The Absolute of finitely generated groups: I. Commutative groups;We give a complete description of the absolute of commutative finitely generated groups and semigroups. The absolute (previously called the exit boundary) is a further elaboration of the notion of the boundary of a random walk on a group (the Poisson--Furstenberg boundary), namely, the absolute of a (semi)group is the set of ergodic central measures on the compactum of all infinite trajectories of a simple random walk on the group. Related notions have been discussed in the probability literature: Martin boundary, entrance and exit boundaries (Dynkin), central measures on path spaces of graphs (Vershik--Kerov). A central measure (with respect to a finite system of generators of a group or semigroup) is a Markov measure on the space of trajectories whose cotransition distribution at every point is the uniform distribution on the generators (i.e., a measure of maximal entropy). For a more general notion of measures with a given cocycle. For the group~$\Bbb Z$, the problem of describing the absolute is solved exactly by the classical de~Finetti's theorem. The main result of this paper, which is a far-reaching generalization of de~Finetti's theorem, is as follows: the absolute of a commutative semigroup coincides with the set of central measures corresponding to (nonstationary) Markov chains with independent identically distributed increments. Topologically, the absolute is (in the main case) a closed disk of finite dimension.;math.GR
1801.02013;Multiscale Sparse Microcanonical Models;We study approximations of non-Gaussian stationary processes having long range correlations with microcanonical models. These models are conditioned by the empirical value of an energy vector, evaluated on a single realization. Asymptotic properties of maximum entropy microcanonical and macrocanonical processes and their convergence to Gibbs measures are reviewed. We show that the Jacobian of the energy vector controls the entropy rate of microcanonical processes. <br />Sampling maximum entropy processes through MCMC algorithms require too many operations when the number of constraints is large. We define microcanonical gradient descent processes by transporting a maximum entropy measure with a gradient descent algorithm which enforces the energy conditions. Convergence and symmetries are analyzed. Approximations of non-Gaussian processes with long range interactions are defined with multiscale energy vectors computed with wavelet and scattering transforms. Sparsity properties are captured with $\bf l^1$ norms. Approximations of Gaussian, Ising and point processes are studied, as well as image and audio texture synthesis.;math-ph
1801.02014;A Class of MSR Codes for Clustered Distributed Storage;Clustered distributed storage models real data centers where intra- and cross-cluster repair bandwidths are different. In this paper, exact-repair minimum-storage-regenerating (MSR) codes achieving capacity of clustered distributed storage are designed. Focus is given on two cases: $\epsilon=0$ and $\epsilon=1/(n-k)$, where $\epsilon$ is the ratio of the available cross- and intra-cluster repair bandwidths, $n$ is the total number of distributed nodes and $k$ is the number of contact nodes in data retrieval. The former represents the scenario where cross-cluster communication is not allowed, while the latter corresponds to the case of minimum cross-cluster bandwidth that is possible under the minimum storage overhead constraint. For the $\epsilon=0$ case, two types of locally repairable codes are proven to achieve the MSR point. As for $\epsilon=1/(n-k)$, an explicit MSR coding scheme is suggested for the two-cluster situation under the specific condition of $n = 2k$.;cs.IT
1801.02015;Reverse and Forward Engineering of Local Voltage Control in Distribution Networks;The increasing penetration of renewable and distributed energy resources in distribution networks calls for real-time and distributed voltage control. In this paper we investigate local Volt/VAR control with a general class of control functions, and show that the power system dynamics with non-incremental local voltage control can be seen as distributed algorithm for solving a well-defined optimization problem (reverse engineering). The reverse engineering further reveals a fundamental limitation of the non-incremental voltage control: the convergence condition is restrictive and prevents better voltage regulation at equilibrium. This motivates us to design two incremental local voltage control schemes based on the subgradient and pseudo-gradient algorithms respectively for solving the same optimization problem (forward engineering). The new control schemes decouple the dynamical property from the equilibrium property, and have much less restrictive convergence conditions. This work presents another step towards developing a new foundation -- network dynamics as optimization algorithms -- for distributed realtime control and optimization of future power networks.;math.OC
1801.02017;On Variational Properties of Quadratic Curvature Functionals;In this paper, we investigate a class of quadratic Riemannian curvature functionals on closed smooth manifold $M$ of dimension $n\ge 3$ on the space of Riemannian metrics on $M$ with unit volume. We study the stability of these functionals at the metric with constant sectional curvature as its critical point.;math.DG
1801.02023;Degree powers in graphs with a forbidden forest;Given a positive integer $p$ and a graph $G$ with degree sequence $d_1,\dots,d_n$, we define $e_p(G)=\sum_{i=1}^n d_i^p$. Caro and Yuster introduced a Tur\'an-type problem for $e_p(G)$: Given a positive integer $p$ and a graph $H$, determine the function $ex_p(n,H)$, which is the maximum value of $e_p(G)$ taken over all graphs $G$ on $n$ vertices that do not contain $H$ as a subgraph. Clearly, $ex_1(n,H)=2ex(n,H)$, where $ex(n,H)$ denotes the classical Tur\'an number. Caro and Yuster determined the function $ex_p(n, P_\ell)$ for sufficiently large $n$, where $p\geq 2$ and $P_\ell$ denotes the path on $\ell$ vertices. In this paper, we generalise this result and determine $ex_p(n,F)$ for sufficiently large $n$, where $p\geq 2$ and $F$ is a linear forest. We also determine $ex_p(n,S)$, where $S$ is a star forest, and $ex_p(n,B)$, where $B$ is a broom graph with diameter at most six.;math.CO
1801.02028;Characterization and Efficient Search of Non-Elementary Trapping Sets of LDPC Codes with Applications to Stopping Sets;In this paper, we propose a characterization for non-elementary trapping sets (NETSs) of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The characterization is based on viewing a NETS as a hierarchy of embedded graphs starting from an ETS. The characterization corresponds to an efficient search algorithm that under certain conditions is exhaustive. As an application of the proposed characterization/search, we obtain lower and upper bounds on the stopping distance $s_{min}$ of LDPC codes. <br />We examine a large number of regular and irregular LDPC codes, and demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of our technique in finding lower and upper bounds on, and in many cases the exact value of, $s_{min}$. Finding $s_{min}$, or establishing search-based lower or upper bounds, for many of the examined codes are out of the reach of any existing algorithm.;cs.IT
1801.02030;Improvements of some operator inequalities involving positive linear maps via the Kantorovich constant;We present some operator inequalities for positive linear maps that generalize and improve the derived results in some recent years. For instant, if $A$ and $B$ are positive operators and $m,m^{'},M,M^{'}$ are positive real numbers satisfying either one of the condition $ 0&lt,m \leq B \leq m^{'} &lt,M^{'} \leq A \leq M $ or $0&lt,m \leq A \leq m^{'} &lt,M^{'} \leq B \leq M$, then \begin{align*} \Phi ^{p} \big(A \nabla _{v} B+2 r Mm (A^{-1}\nabla B^{-1}- &amp,A^{-1} \sharp B^{-1} )\big)\\ &amp, \leq \left( \frac{K(h)}{ 4^{\frac{2}{p}-1} K^{r_{1}} \left( \sqrt {h^{'}}\right)} \right) ^{p} \Phi^{p} (A \sharp_{\nu} B) \end{align*} and \begin{align*} \Phi ^{p} \big(A \nabla _{v} B+2 r Mm (A^{-1}\nabla B^{-1}-&amp, A^{-1} \sharp B^{-1} )\big) \\ &amp,\leq \left( \frac{K(h)}{ 4^{\frac{2}{p}-1} K^{r_{1}}\left( \sqrt {h^{'}}\right)}\right) ^{p} (\Phi(A) \sharp_{\nu} \Phi (B))^{p}, \end{align*} where $\Phi$ is a positive unital linear map, $ 0 \leq \nu \leq 1$, $p \geq 2,$ $r=\min\{\nu,1-\nu\},$ $h=\frac{M}{m},$ $h^{'}=\frac{M^{'}}{m^{'}}$, $K(h)=\frac{(1+h)^{2}}{4h}$ and $r_{1}=\min\{2r,1-2r\}.$ We also obtain a reverse of the Ando inequality for positive linear maps via the Kantorovich constant.;math.FA
1801.02036;Multiscale analysis of semilinear damped stochastic wave equations;In this paper we proceed with the multiscale analysis of semilinear damped stochastic wave motions. The analysis is made by combining the well-known sigma convergence method with its stochastic counterpart, associated to some compactness results such as the Prokhorov and Skorokhod theorems. We derive the equivalent model, which is of the same type as the micro-model.;math.AP
1801.02039;On the existence of global-in-time weak solutions and scaling laws for Kolmogorov&#x27,s two-equation model of turbulence;This paper is concerned with Kolmogorov's two-equation model for the free turbulence in three dimensions. We first discuss scaling laws for slightly more general two-equation models to highlight the special role of the model devised by Kolmogorov in 1942. The main part of the paper consists in proving the existence of weak solutions of Kolmogorov's under space-periodic boundary conditions in a cube. To this end, we provide new a priori estimates and invoke existence result for pseudo-monotone operators.;math.AP

1801.02043;Algorithms for orbit closure separation for invariants and semi-invariants of matrices;We consider two group actions on $m$-tuples of $n \times n$ matrices. The first is simultaneous conjugation by $\operatorname{GL}_n$ and the second is the left-right action of $\operatorname{SL}_n \times \operatorname{SL}_n$. We give efficient algorithms to decide if the orbit closures of two points intersect. We also improve the known bounds for the degree of separating invariants in these cases.;math.RA
1801.02044;Multilabeled versions of Sperner&#x27,s and Fan&#x27,s lemmas and applications;We propose a general technique related to the polytopal Sperner lemma for proving old and new multilabeled versions of Sperner's lemma. A notable application of this technique yields a cake-cutting theorem where the number of players and the number of pieces can be independently chosen. We also prove multilabeled versions of Fan's lemma, a combinatorial analogue of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem, and exhibit applications to fair division and graph coloring.;math.CO
1801.02046;Checking Admissibility Using Natural Dualities;This paper presents a new method for obtaining small algebras to check the admissibility-equivalently, validity in free algebras-of quasi-identities in a finitely generated quasivariety. Unlike a previous algebraic approach of Metcalfe and Rothlisberger that is feasible only when the relevant free algebra is not too large, this method exploits natural dualities for quasivarieties to work with structures of smaller cardinality and surjective rather than injective morphisms. A number of case studies are described here that could not be be solved using the algebraic approach, including (quasi)varieties of MS-algebras, double Stone algebras, and involutive Stone algebras.;math.LO
1801.02050;Statistical estimation of the Shannon entropy;The behavior of the Kozachenko - Leonenko estimates for the (differential) Shannon entropy is studied when the number of i.i.d. vector-valued observations tends to infinity. The asymptotic unbiasedness and L^2-consistency of the estimates are established. The conditions employed involve the analogues of the Hardy - Littlewood maximal function. It is shown that the results are valid in particular for the entropy estimation of any nondegenerate Gaussian vector.;math.ST
1801.02051;Stochastic B-series and order conditions for exponential integrators;We discuss stochastic differential equations with a stiff linear part and their approximation by stochastic exponential integrators. Representing the exact and approximate solutions using B-series and rooted trees, we derive the order conditions for stochastic exponential integrators. The resulting general order theory covers both It\^{o} and Stratonovich integration.;math.NA
1801.02061;Optimal Error Correcting Delivery Scheme for an Optimal Coded Caching Scheme with Small Buffers;Optimal delivery scheme for coded caching problems with small buffer sizes and the number of users no less than the amount of files in the server was proposed by Chen, Fan and Letaief ["Fundamental limits of caching: improved bounds for users with small buffers," (IET Communications), 2016]. This scheme is referred to as the CFL scheme. In this paper, the link between the server and the users is assumed to be error prone only during the delivery phase. Closed form expressions for average rate and peak rate of error correcting delivery scheme for CFL prefetching scheme is obtained. An optimal error correcting delivery scheme for caching problems employing CFL prefetching is proposed.;cs.IT
1801.02066;Resource Optimization with Flexible Numerology and Frame Structure for Heterogeneous Services;We explore the potential of optimizing resource allocation with flexible numerology in frequency domain and variable frame structure in time domain, in presence of services with different types of requirements. We analyze the computational complexity and propose a scalable optimization algorithm based on searching in both the primal space and dual space that are complementary to each other. Numerical results show significant advantages of adopting flexibility in both time and frequency domains for capacity enhancement and meeting the requirements of mission critical services.;cs.IT
1801.02070;Error analysis of one-stage explicit extended RKN integrators for semilinear wave equations;In this paper, we present an error analysis of one-stage explicit extended Runge--Kutta--Nystr\"{o}m integrators for semilinear wave equations. These equations are analysed by using spatial semidiscretizations with periodic boundary conditions in one space dimension. Optimal second-order convergence is proved without requiring Lipschitz continuous and higher regularity of the exact solution. Moreover, the error analysis is not restricted to the spectral semidiscretization in space.;math.NA
1801.02071;$n$-Ary generalized Lie-type color algebras admitting a quasi-multiplicative basis;The class of generalized Lie-type color algebras contains the ones of generalized Lie-type algebras, of $n$-Lie algebras and superalgebras, commutative Leibniz $n$-ary algebras and superalgebras, among others. We focus on the class of generalized Lie-type color algebras $\frak L$ admitting a quasi-multiplicative basis, with restrictions neither on the dimensions nor on the base field $\mathbb F$ and study its structure. If we write $\frak L = \mathbb V \oplus \mathbb W$ with $\mathbb V$ and $0 \neq \mathbb W$ linear subspaces, we say that a basis of homogeneous elements $\mathfrak{B} = \{e_i\}_{i \in I}$ of $\mathbb W$ is quasi-multiplicative if given $0 &lt, k &lt, n,$ for $i_1,\dots,i_k \in I$ and $\sigma \in \mathbb S_n$ satisfies $\langle e_{i_1}, \dots, e_{i_k}, \mathbb V, \dots, \mathbb V \rangle_{\sigma} \subset \mathbb{F}e_{j_{\sigma}}$ for some $j_{\sigma} \in I,$ the product of elements of the basis $\langle e_{i_1}, \dots, e_{i_n} \rangle$ belongs to $\mathbb{F}e_j$ for some $j \in I$ or to $\mathbb V$, and a similar condition is verified for the product $\langle \mathbb V, \dots,\mathbb V \rangle$. We state that if $\frak L$ admits a quasi-multiplicative basis then it decomposes as $\mathfrak{L} ={\mathcal U} \oplus (\sum\limits {\frak J}_{k})$ with any ${\frak J}_k$ a well described color gLt-ideal of $\frak L$ admitting also a quasi-multiplicative basis, and ${\mathcal U}$ a linear subspace of $\mathbb V$. <br />Also the minimality of $\frak L$ is characterized in terms of the connections and it is shown that the above direct sum is by means of the family of its minimal color gLt-ideals, admitting each one a $\mu$-quasi-multiplicative basis inherited by the one of $\frak L$.;math.RA
1801.02074;Probabilistic Control for Uncertain Systems;In this paper a new framework has been applied to the design of controllers which encompasses nonlinearity, hysteresis and arbitrary density functions of forward models and inverse controllers. Using mixture density networks, the probabilistic models of both the forward and inverse dynamics are estimated such that they are dependent on the state and the control input. The optimal control strategy is then derived which minimizes uncertainty of the closed loop system. In the absence of reliable plant models, the proposed control algorithm incorporates uncertainties in model parameters, observations, and latent processes. The local stability of the closed loop system has been established. The efficacy of the control algorithm is demonstrated on two nonlinear stochastic control examples with additive and multiplicative noise.;math.OC
1801.02083;Delta-problems for the generalized Euler-Darboux equation;Degenerate hyperbolic equations are dealing with many important issues for applied nature. While a variety of degenerate equations and boundary conditions, successfully matched to these differential equation, most in the characteristic coordinates reduced to Euler-Darboux one. Some boundary value problems, in particular Cauchy problem, for the specified equation demanded the introduction of special classes in which formulae are simple and can be used to meet the new challenges, including Delta-problems in squares that contain singularity line for equation coefficients with data on adjacent or parallel sides of the square. In this short communication the generalized Euler-Darboux equation with negative parameters in the rectangular region is considered.;math.AP
1801.02088;Mobi algebra as an abstraction to the unit interval and its comparison to rings;We begin by introducing an algebraic structure with three constants and one ternary operation to which we call mobi algebra. This structure has been designed to capture the most relevant properties of the unit interval that are needed in the study of geodesic paths. Another algebraic structure, called involutive medial monoid (IMM), can be derived from a mobi algebra. We prove several results on the interplay between mobi algebras, IMM algebras and unitary rings. It turns out that every unitary ring with one half uniquely determines and is uniquely determined by a mobi algebra with one double. This paper is the second of a planned series of papers dedicated to the study of geodesic paths from an algebraic point of view.;math.RA
1801.02089;The tropical analogue of the Helton-Nie conjecture is true;Helton and Nie conjectured that every convex semialgebraic set over the field of real numbers can be written as the projection of a spectrahedron. Recently, Scheiderer disproved this conjecture. We show, however, that the following result, which may be thought of as a tropical analogue of this conjecture, is true: over a real closed nonarchimedean field of Puiseux series, the convex semialgebraic sets and the projections of spectrahedra have precisely the same images by the nonarchimedean valuation. The proof relies on game theory methods.;math.AG
1801.02090;Testing equality in distribution of random convex compact sets via theory of N-distances and its application to assessing similarity of general random sets;This paper concerns a method of testing equality of distribution of random convex compact sets and the way how to use the test to distinguish between two realisations of general random sets. The family of metrics on the space of distributions of random convex compact sets is constructed using the theory of N-distances and characteristic functions of random convex compact sets. Further, the approximation of the metrics through its finite dimensional counterparts is proposed, which lead to a new statistical test for testing equality in distribution of two random convex compact sets. Then, it is described how to approximate a realisation of a general random set by a union of convex compact sets, and it is shown how to determine whether two realisations of general random sets come from the same process using the constructed test. The procedure is justified by an extensive simulation study.;math.ST
1801.02092;Imperfect bifurcation for the quasi-geostrophic shallow-water equations;We study analytical and numerical aspects of the bifurcation diagram of simply-connected rotating vortex patch equilibria for the quasi-geostrophic shallow-water (QGSW) equations. The QGSW equations are a generalisation of the Euler equations and contain an additional parameter, the Rossby deformation length $\EE^{-1}$, which enters in the relation between streamfunction and (potential) vorticity. The Euler equations are recovered in the limit $\EE\to 0$. We prove, close to circular (Rankine) vortices, the persistence of the bifurcation diagram for arbitrary Rossby deformation length. However we show that the two-fold branch, corresponding to Kirchhoff ellipses for the Euler equations, is never connected even for small values $\EE$, and indeed is split into a countable set of disjoint connected branches. Accurate numerical calculations of the global structure of the bifurcation diagram and of the limiting equilibrium states are also presented to complement the mathematical analysis.;math.AP
1801.02097;Operator-norm convergence estimates for elliptic homogenisation problems on periodic singular structures;For a an arbitrary periodic Borel measure $\mu$, we prove order $O(\varepsilon)$ operator-norm resolvent estimates for the solutions to scalar elliptic problems in $L^2({\mathbb R}^d, d\mu^\varepsilon)$ with $\varepsilon$-periodic coefficients, $\varepsilon&gt,0.$ Here $\mu^\varepsilon$ is the measure obtained by $\varepsilon$-scaling of $\mu.$ Our analysis includes both the case of a measure absolutely continuous with respect to the standard Lebesgue measure and the case of "singular" periodic structures (or "multistructures"), when $\mu$ is supported by lower-dimensional manifolds.;math.AP
1801.02102;On the interplay among maximum principles, compact support principles and Keller-Osserman conditions on manifolds;This paper is about the influence of Geometry on the qualitative behaviour of solutions of quasilinear PDEs on Riemannian manifolds. Motivated by examples arising, among others, from the theory of submanifolds, in particular by the study of entire graphs with prescribed mean curvature, we consider classes of coercive differential inequalities of the form $$ \mathrm{div}\left( \frac{\varphi(|\nabla u|)}{|\nabla u|} \nabla u\right) \ge b(x)f(u) l(|\nabla u|) \qquad \text{(respectively, $\le$ or $=$)} $$ on domains of a manifold $M$, for suitable $\varphi,b,f,l$, with emphasis on mean curvature type operators. We investigate the validity of strong maximum principles, compact support principles and Liouville type theorems, in particular, the goal is to identify sharp thresholds, involving curvatures or volume growth of geodesic balls in $M$, to guarantee the above properties under appropriate Keller-Osserman type conditions, and to discuss the geometric reasons behind the existence of such thresholds. The paper also aims to give a unified view of recent results in the literature. The bridge with Geometry is realized by studying the validity of weak and strong maximum principles at infinity, in the spirit of Omori-Yau's Hessian and Laplacian principles and subsequent improvements.;math.AP
1801.02103;Continuous generalization of Clarkson-McCarthy inequalities;Let $G$ be a compact abelian group, let $\mu$ be the corresponding Haar measure, and let $\hat G$ be the Pontryagin dual of $G$. Further, let $C_p$ denote the Schatten class of operators on some separable infinite dimensional Hilbert space, and let $L^p(G,C_p)$ denote the corresponding Bochner space. If $G\ni\theta\mapsto A_\theta$ is the mapping belonging to $L^p(G,C_p)$ then, $$\sum_{k\in\hat G}\left\|\int_G\overline{k(\theta)}A_\theta\,\mathrm{d}\theta\right\|_p^p\le\int_G\|A_\theta\|_p^p\,\mathrm{d}\theta,\qquad p\ge2$$ $$\sum_{k\in\hat G}\left\|\int_G\overline{k(\theta)}A_\theta\,\mathrm{d}\theta\right\|_p^p\le\left(\int_G\|A_\theta\|_p^q\,\mathrm{d}\theta\right)^{p/q},\qquad p\ge2.$$ $$\sum_{k\in\hat G}\left\|\int_G\overline{k(\theta)}A_\theta\,\mathrm{d}\theta\right\|_p^q\le\left(\int_G\|A_\theta\|_p^p\,\mathrm{d}\theta\right)^{q/p},\qquad p\le2.$$ <br />If $G$ is a finite group, the previous comprises several earlier obtained generalizations of Clarkson-McCarthy inequalities (e.g. $G=\mathbf{Z}_n$ or $G=\mathbf{Z}_2^n$), as well as the original inequalities, for $G=\mathbf{Z}_2$. <br />Other related inequalities are also obtained.;math.FA
1801.02105;Twisted conjugacy and quasi-isometric rigidity of irreducible lattices in semisimple Lie groups;Let $G$ be a non-compact semisimple Lie group with finite centre and finitely many components. We show that any finitely generated group $\Gamma$ which is quasi-isometric to an irreducible lattice in $G$ has the $R_\infty$-property, namely, that there are infinitely $\phi$-twisted conjugacy classes for every automorphism $\phi$ of $\Gamma$. Also, we show that any lattice in $G$ has the $R_\infty$-property, extending our earlier result for irreducible lattices.;math.GR
1801.02110;Equivariant dendroidal Segal spaces and $G$-$\infty$-operads;We introduce the analogues of the notions of complete Segal space and of Segal category in the context of equivariant operads with norm maps, and build model categories with these as the fibrant objects. We then show that these model categories are Quillen equivalent to each other and to the model category for $G$-$\infty$-operads built in a previous paper. Moreover, we establish variants of these results for the Blumberg-Hill indexing systems. In an appendix, we discuss Reedy categories in the equivariant context.;math.AT
1801.02111;Convergence of the empirical spectral distribution of Gaussian matrix-valued processes;For a given normalized Gaussian symmetric matrix-valued process $Y^{(n)}$, we consider the process of its eigenvalues $\{(\lambda_{1}^{(n)}(t),\dots, \lambda_{n}^{(n)}(t)), t\ge 0\}$ as well as its corresponding process of empirical spectral measures $\mu^{(n)}=(\mu_{t}^{(n)}, t\geq0)$. Under some mild conditions on the covariance function associated to $Y^{(n)}$, we prove that the process $\mu^{(n)}$ converges in probability to a deterministic limit $\mu$, in the topology of uniform convergence over compact sets. We show that the process $\mu$ is characterized by its Cauchy transform, which is a rescaling of the solution of a Burgers' equation. Our results extend those of Rogers and Shi for the free Brownian motion and Pardo et al. for the non-commutative fractional Brownian motion when $H&gt,1/2$ whose arguments use strongly the non-collision of the eigenvalues. Our methodology does not require the latter property and in particular explains the remaining case of the non-commutative fractional Brownian motion for $H&lt, 1/2$ which, up to our knowledge, was unknown.;math.PR

1801.02114;Measure Upper Bounds of Nodal Sets of Robin Eigenfunctions;In this paper, we obtain the upper bounds for the Hausdorff measures of nodal sets of eigenfunctions with the Robin boundary conditions, i.e., <br />\begin{equation*} {\left\{\begin{array}{l} <br />\triangle u+\lambda u=0,\quad in\quad \Omega,\\ u_{\nu}+\mu u=0,\quad on\quad\partial\Omega, \end{array} \right.} \end{equation*} where the domain $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$, $u_{\nu}$ means the derivative of $u$ along the outer normal direction of $\partial\Omega$. We show that, if $\Omega$ is bounded and analytic, and the corresponding eigenvalue $\lambda$ is large enough,then the measure upper bounds for the nodal sets of eigenfunctions are $C\sqrt{\lambda}$, where $C$ is a positive constant depending only on $n$ and $\Omega$ but not on $\mu$ We also show that, if $\partial\Omega$ is $C^{\infty}$ smooth and $\partial\Omega\setminus\Gamma$ is piecewise analytic, where $\Gamma\subseteq\partial\Omega$ is a union of some $n-2$ dimensional submanifolds of $\partial\Omega$, $\mu&gt,0$, and $\lambda$ is large enough, then the corresponding measure upper bounds for the nodal sets of $u$ are $C(\sqrt{\lambda}+\mu^{\alpha}+\mu^{-c\alpha})$ for some positive number $\alpha$, where $c$ is a positive constant depending only on $n$, and $C$ is a positive constant depending on $n$, $\Omega$, $\Gamma$ and $\alpha$.;math.AP
1801.02126;Relative Equilibria in curved restricted 4-body problems;We consider the curved 4-body problems on spheres and hyperbolic spheres. After obtaining a criterion for the existence of quadrilateral configu- rations on the equator of the sphere, we study two restricted 4-body problems, one in which two masses are negligible, and another in which only one mass is negligible. In the former we prove the evidence square-like relative equilibria, whereas in the latter we discuss the existence of kite-shaped relative equilibria.;math.CA
1801.02130;Dynamic Traffic Assignment using the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram: A Review of Vehicular and Pedestrian Flow Models;Traditional DTA models of large cities suffer from prohibitive computation times and calibration/validation can become major challenges faced by practitioners. The empirical evidence in 2008 in support of the existence of a Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) on urban networks led to the formulation of discrete-space models, where the city is divided into a collection of reservoirs. Prior to 2008, a large body of DTA models based on pedestrian flow models had been formulated in continuum space as 2-dimensional conservation laws where the speed-density relationship can now be interpreted as the MFD. Perhaps surprisingly, we found that this continuum-space literature has been mostly unaware of MFD theory, and no attempts exist to verify the assumptions of MFD theory. This has the potential to create significant inconsistencies, and research is needed to analyze their extent and ways to resolve them. We also find that further research is needed to (i) incorporate departure time choice, (ii) improve existing numerical methods, possibly extending recent advances on the one-dimensional kinematic wave (LWR) model, (iii) study the properties of system optimum solutions, (iv) examine the real-time applicability of current continuum-space models compared to traditional DTA methods, and (v) formulate anisotropic models for the interaction of intersecting flows.;math.AP
1801.02142;Tiltan;We prove that tiltan is consistent with the negation of Galvin's property. On the other hand, superclub implies Galvin's property. We also show that tiltan is consistent with a large value of the splitting number at kappa, where kappa is supercompact.;math.LO
1801.02145;Depth-graded motivic Lie algebra;Consider the neutral Tannakian category mixed Tate motives over Z, in this paper we suggest a way to understand the structure of depth-graded motivic Lie subalgebra generated by the depth one part. We will show that from an isomorphism conjecture proposed by K. Tasaka we can deduce the F. Brown matrix conjecture and the non-degenerated conjecture about depth-graded motivic Lie subalgebra generated by the depth one part.;math.NT
1801.02146;Polyharmonic weak Maass forms of higher depth for SL_2(Z);The space of polyharmonic Maass forms was introduced by Lagarias-Rhoades, recently. They constructed its basis from the Taylor coefficients of the real analytic Eisenstein series. In this paper, we introduce polyharmonic weak Maass forms, that is, we relax the moderate growth condition at cusp, and we construct a basis as a generalization of Lagarias-Rhoades' works. As a corollary, we can obtain a preimage of an arbitrary polyharmonic weak Maass form under the xi-operator.;math.NT
1801.02152;Characterization of matrices $B$ such that $(I,B,B^2)$ generates a digital net with $t$-value zero;We study $3$-dimensional digital nets over $\mathbb{F}_2$ generated by matrices $(I,B,B^2)$ where $I$ is the identity matrix and $B$ is a square matrix. We give a characterization of $B$ for which the $t$-value of the digital net is $0$. As a corollary, we prove that such $B$ satisfies $B^3=I$.;math.NT
1801.02157;Concentration of the spectral norm of Erd&#x151,s-R&#xe9,nyi random graphs;We present results on the concentration properties of the spectral norm $\|A_p\|$ of the adjacency matrix $A_p$ of an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$. First we consider the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph process and prove that $\|A_p\|$ is uniformly concentrated over the range $p\in [C\log n/n,1]$. The analysis is based on delocalization arguments, uniform laws of large numbers, together with the entropy method to prove concentration inequalities. As an application of our techniques we prove sharp sub-Gaussian moment inequalities for $\|A_p\|$ for all $p\in [c\log^3n/n,1]$ that improve the general bounds of Alon, Krivelevich, and Vu (2001) and some of the more recent results of Erd\H{o}s et al. (2013). Both results are consistent with the asymptotic result of F\"uredi and Koml\'os (1981) that holds for fixed $p$ as $n\to \infty$.;math.PR
1801.02158;Blind Demixing for Low-Latency Communication;In the next generation wireless networks, lowlatency communication is critical to support emerging diversified applications, e.g., Tactile Internet and Virtual Reality. In this paper, a novel blind demixing approach is developed to reduce the channel signaling overhead, thereby supporting low-latency communication. Specifically, we develop a low-rank approach to recover the original information only based on a single observed vector without any channel estimation. Unfortunately, this problem turns out to be a highly intractable non-convex optimization problem due to the multiple non-convex rankone constraints. To address the unique challenges, the quotient manifold geometry of product of complex asymmetric rankone matrices is exploited by equivalently reformulating original complex asymmetric matrices to the Hermitian positive semidefinite matrices. We further generalize the geometric concepts of the complex product manifolds via element-wise extension of the geometric concepts of the individual manifolds. A scalable Riemannian trust-region algorithm is then developed to solve the blind demixing problem efficiently with fast convergence rates and low iteration cost. Numerical results will demonstrate the algorithmic advantages and admirable performance of the proposed algorithm compared with the state-of-art methods.;cs.IT
1801.02159;Supergrassmannians as Homogeneous Superspaces;A homogeneous space is a manifold on which a Lie group acts transitively. Super generalization of this concept is also studied in [2] and [4]. In this paper we explicitly show that super Lie group GL(m|n) acts transitively on supergrassmannian G_{k|l}(m|n). In this regard, by using functor of point approach, this action is constructed by gluing local actions.;math.DG
1801.02161;Metastability in Stochastic Replicator Dynamics;We consider a novel model of stochastic replicator dynamics for potential games that converts to a Langevin equation on a sphere after a change of variables. This is distinct from the models studied earlier. In particular, it is ill-posed due to non-uniqueness of solutions, but is amenable to a natural selection principle that picks a unique solution. The model allows us to make specific statements regarding metastable states such as small noise asymptotics for mean exit times from their domain of attraction, and quasi-stationary measures. We illustrate the general results by specializing them to replicator dynamics on graphs and demonstrate that the numerical experiments support theoretical predictions.;math.PR
1801.02164;Spectrality of product domains and Fuglede&#x27,s conjecture for convex polytopes;A set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is said to be spectral if the space $L^2(\Omega)$ has an orthogonal basis of exponential functions. It is well-known that in many respects, spectral sets "behave like" sets which can tile the space by translations. This suggests a conjecture that a product set $\Omega = A \times B$ is spectral if and only if the factors $A$ and $B$ are both spectral sets. We recently proved this in the case when $A$ is an interval in dimension one. The main result of the present paper is that the conjecture is true also when $A$ is a convex polygon in two dimensions. We discuss this result in connection with the conjecture that a convex polytope $\Omega$ is spectral if and only if it can tile by translations.;math.CA
1801.02172;Market-based Control of Air-Conditioning Loads with Switching Constraints for Providing Ancillary Services;Air-conditioning loads (ACLs) are among the most promising demand side resources for their thermal storage capacity and fast response potential. This paper adopts the principle of market-based control (MBC) for the ACLs to participate in the ancillary services. The MBC method is suitable for the control of distributed ACLs because it can satisfy diversified requirements, reduce the communication bandwidth and protect users' privacy. The modified bidding and clearing strategies proposed in this paper makes it possible to adjust the switching frequency and strictly satisfy the lockout time constraint for mechanical wear reduction and device protection, without increasing the communication traffic and computational cost of the control center. The performance of the ACL cluster in two typical ancillary services is studied to demonstrate the effect of the proposed method. The case studies also investigate how the control parameters affect the response performance, comfort level and switching frequency.;math.OC
1801.02173;Weighted estimates for the Calder&#xf3,n commutator;In this paper, the authors establish some weighted estimates for the Calder\'on commutator defined by \begin{eqnarray*} &amp,&amp,\mathcal{C}_{m+1,\,A}(a_1,\dots,a_{m},f)(x) &amp,&amp,\quad={\rm p.\,v.}\,\int_{\mathbb{R}}\frac{P_2(A,\,x,\,y)\prod_{j=1}^m(A_j(x)-A_j(y))}{(x-y)^{m+2}}f(y){\rm d}y, \end{eqnarray*} with $P_2(A,\,x,\,y)=A(x)-A(y)-A'(y)(x-y)$. Dominating this operator by multi(sub)linear sparse operators, the authors establish the weighted bounds from $L^{p_1}(\mathbb{R},w_1)$ $\times\dots\times L^{p_m}(\mathbb{R},w_m)$ to $L^{p}(\mathbb{R},\nu_{\vec{w}})$, with $p_1,\dots,p_m \in (1,\,\infty)$, $1/p=1/p_1+\dots+1/p_m$, and $\vec{w}=(w_1,\,\dots,\,w_m)\in A_{\vec{P}}(\mathbb{R}^{m+1})$. The authors also obtain the weighted weak type endpoint estimates for this operator;math.CA
1801.02177;Accuracy of noisy Spike-Train Reconstruction: a Singularity Theory point of view;This is a survey paper discussing one specific (and classical) system of algebraic equations - the so called "Prony system". We provide a short overview of its unusually wide connections with many different fields of Mathematics, stressing the role of Singularity Theory. We reformulate Prony System as the problem of reconstruction of "Spike-train" signals of the form $F(x)=\sum_{j=1}^d a_j\delta(x-x_j)$ from the noisy moment measurements. We provide an overview of some recent results of [1-3, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 5] on the "geometry of the error amplification" in the reconstruction process, in situations where the nodes $x_j$ near-collide. Some algebraic-geometric structures, underlying the error amplification, are described (Prony, Vieta, and Hankel mappings, Prony varieties), as well as their connection with Vandermonde mappings and varieties. Our main goal is to present some promising fields of possible applications of Singulary Theory.;math.NA
1801.02179;Effective strong convergence of the proximal point algorithm in CAT(0) spaces;We apply methods of proof mining to obtain uniform quantitative bounds on the strong convergence of the proximal point algorithm for finding minimizers of convex, lower semicontinuous proper functions in CAT(0) spaces. Thus, for uniformly convex functions we compute rates of convergence, while, for totally bounded CAT(0) spaces we apply methods introduced by Kohlenbach, the first author and Nicolae to compute rates of metastability.;math.OC
1801.02180;Contact (+1)-surgeries along Legendrian Two-component Links;In this paper, we study contact surgeries along Legendrian links in the standard contact 3-sphere. On one hand, we use algebraic methods to prove the vanishing of the contact Ozsv\'{a}th-Szab\'{o} invariant for contact $(+1)$-surgery along certain Legendrian two-component links. The main tool is a link surgery formula for Heegaard Floer homology developed by Manolescu and Ozsv\'{a}th. On the other hand, we use contact-geometric argument to show the overtwistedness of the contact 3-manifolds obtained by contact $(+1)$-surgeries along Legendrian two-component links whose two components are linked in some special configurations.;math.GT
1801.02182;On Laporta&#x27,s 4-loop sunrise formulae;We prove Laporta's conjecture\begin{align*}&amp,\int_0^\infty\frac{\mathrm d\, x_1}{x_1}\int_0^\infty\frac{\mathrm d\, x_2}{x_2}\int_0^\infty\frac{\mathrm d\, x_3}{x_3}\int_0^\infty\frac{\mathrm d\, x_4}{x_4}\frac{1}{\left(1+\sum^4_{k=1}x_k\right)\left(1+\sum^4_{k=1}\frac{1}{x_{k}} \right)-1}\\={}&amp,\frac43 \int_{0}^\pi\mathrm d\, \phi_1 \int_{0}^\pi\mathrm d\, \phi_2\int_{0}^\pi\mathrm d\, \phi_3 \int_{0}^\pi\mathrm d\, \phi_4\frac{1}{4-\sum_{k=1}^4\cos \phi_k}, \end{align*} which relates the 4-loop sunrise diagram in 2-dimensional quantum field theory to Watson's integral for 4-dimensional hypercubic lattice. We also establish several related integral identities proposed by Laporta, including a reduction of the 4-loop sunrise diagram to special values of Euler's gamma function and generalized hypergeometric series:\begin{align*} \frac{4 \pi ^{5/2}}{\sqrt{3}}\left\{ \frac{\sqrt{3} }{2^6 }\left[\frac{\Gamma \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)}{\sqrt{\pi}}\right]^9\, _4F_3\left(\left. \begin{array}{c}\frac{1}{6},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2}\\[4pt]\frac{2}{3},\frac{5}{6},\frac{5}{6}\end{array} \right|1\right)-\frac{2^{4}}{3}\left[\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{\Gamma \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)}\right]^9\, _4F_3\left(\left. \begin{array}{c}\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{3},\frac{2}{3},\frac{5}{6}\\[4pt]\frac{7}{6},\frac{7}{6},\frac{4}{3}\end{array} \right|1\right) \right\}. \end{align*};math.CA
1801.02183;Varadhan Asymptotics for the Heat Kernel on Finite Graphs;Let $G$ be a simple, finite graph and let $p_t(x,y)$ denote the heat kernel on $G$. The purpose of this short note is to show that for $t \rightarrow 0^+$ $$ p_t(x,y) = \# \left\{\mbox{paths of length}~d(x,y)~\mbox{between}~x~\mbox{and}~y\right\} \frac{t^{d(x,y)}}{d(x,y)!} + \mathcal{O}(t^{d(x,y)+1}),$$ where $d(x,y)$ is the usual Graph distance. This is the discrete analogue of the classical Varadhan asymptotic for the heat kernel on manifolds and refines a result of Keller, Lenz, M\"unch, Schmidt and Telcs. The asymptotic behavior encapsulates additional geometric information: if the Graph is bipartite, then the next term in the expansion is negative.;math.AP
1801.02186;Clique-coloring of $K_{3,3}$-minor free graphs;A clique-coloring of a given graph $G$ is a coloring of the vertices of $G$ such that no maximal clique of size at least two is monocolored. The clique-chromatic number of $G$ is the least number of colors for which $G$ admits a clique-coloring. It has been proved that every planar graph is $3$-clique colorable and every claw-free planar graph, different from an odd cycle, is $2$-clique colorable. In this paper, we generalize these results to $K_{3,3}$-minor free ($K_{3,3}$-subdivision free) graphs.;math.CO
1801.02194;Private Computation of Systematically Encoded Data with Colluding Servers;Private Computation (PC), recently introduced by Sun and Jafar, is a generalization of Private Information Retrieval (PIR) in which a user wishes to privately compute an arbitrary function of data stored across several servers. We construct a PC scheme which accounts for server collusion, coded data, and non-linear functions. For data replicated over several possibly colluding servers, our scheme computes arbitrary functions of the data with rate equal to the asymptotic capacity of PIR for this setup. For systematically encoded data stored over colluding servers, we privately compute arbitrary functions of the columns of the data matrix and calculate the rate explicitly for polynomial functions. The scheme is a generalization of previously studied star-product PIR schemes.;cs.IT
1801.02207;On the role of curvature in the elastic energy of non-Euclidean thin bodies;We prove a relation between the scaling $h^\beta$ of the elastic energies of shrinking non-Euclidean bodies $S_h$ of thickness $h\to 0$, and the curvature along their mid-surface $S$. This extends and generalizes similar results for plates [BLS16, LRR] to any dimension and co-dimension. In particular, it proves that the natural scaling for non-Euclidean rods with smooth metric is $h^4$, as claimed in [AAE+12] using a formal asymptotic expansion. The proof involves calculating the $\Gamma$-limit for the elastic energies of small balls $B_h(p)$, scaled by $h^4$, and showing that the limit infimum energy is given by a square of a norm of the curvature at a point $p$. This $\Gamma$-limit proves asymptotics calculated in [AKM+16].;math.AP
1801.02208;Johnson pseudo-contractibility and pseudo-amenability of $ &#x3b8,$-Lau product of Banach algebras;Given Banach algebras $ A $ and $ B $ with $ \theta\in\Delta(B) $. We shall study the Johnson pseudo-contractibility and pseudo-amenability of $ \theta $-Lau product $ A\times_{\theta} B $. We show that if $ A\times_{\theta} B $ is Johnson pseudo-contractible, then $ A $ is Johnson pseudo-contractible and has a bounded approximate identity and $ B $ is Johnson pseudo-contractible. In some particular cases complete characterization of Johnson pseudo-contractibility of $ A\times_{\theta} B $ are given. Also, we show that pseudo-amenability of $ A\times_{\theta} B $ implies approximate amenability of $ A $ and pseudo-amenability of $ B $.;math.FA
1801.02212;The fifth moment of Hecke L-functions in the weight aspect;We prove an upper bound for the fifth moment of Hecke L-functions associated to holomorphic Hecke cusp forms of full level and weight k in a dyadic interval K &lt, k &lt, 2K, as K tends to infinity. The bound is sharp on Selberg's eigenvalue conjecture.;math.NT
1801.02213;On the divisibility of some truncated hypergeometric series;Let $p$ be an odd prime and $r\geq 1$. Suppose that $\alpha$ is a $p$-adic integer with $\alpha\equiv2a\pmod p$ for some $1\leq a&lt,(p+r)/(2r+1)$. We confirm a conjecture of Sun and prove that $${}_{2r+1}F_{2r}\bigg[\begin{matrix}\alpha&amp,\alpha&amp,\ldots&amp,\alpha\\ &amp,1&amp,\ldots&amp,1\end{matrix}\bigg|\,1\bigg]_{p-1}\equiv0\pmod{p^2},$$ where the truncated hypergeometric series $$ {}_{q+1}F_{q}\bigg[\begin{matrix}x_0&amp,x_1&amp,\ldots&amp,x_{q}\\ &amp,y_1&amp,\ldots&amp,y_q\end{matrix}\bigg|\,z\bigg]_{n}:=\sum_{k=0}^n\frac{(x_0)_k(x_1)_k\cdots(x_q)_k}{(y_1)_k\cdot (y_q)_k}\cdot\frac{z^k}{k!}. $$;math.NT
1801.02214;Linear algebra properties of dissipative Hamiltonian descriptor systems;A wide class of matrix pencils connected with dissipative Hamiltonian descriptor systems is investigated. In particular, the following properties are shown: all eigenvalues are in the closed left half plane, the nonzero finite eigenvalues on the imaginary axis are semisimple, the index is at most two, and there are restrictions for the possible left and right minimal indices. For the case that the eigenvalue zero is not semisimple, a structure-preserving method is presented that perturbs the given system into a Lyapunov stable system.;math.NA
1801.02218;Critical Multipliers in Semidefinite Programming;It was proved in [14] that the existence of a noncritical multiplier for a (smooth) nonlinear programming problem is equivalent to an error bound condition for the Karush-Kuhn-Thcker (KKT) system without any assumptions. This paper investigates whether this result still holds true for a (smooth) nonlinear semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. We first introduce the notion of critical and noncritical multipliers for a SDP problem and obtain their complete characterizations in terms of the problem data. We prove for the SDP problem, the noncriticality property can be derived from the error bound condition for the KKT system without any assumptions, and this fact is revealed by some simple examples. Besides we give an appropriate second-order sufficient optimality condition characterizing noncriticality explicitly. We propose a set of assumptions from which the error bound condition for the KKT system can be derived from the noncriticality property. Finally we establish a new error bound for x-part, which is expressed by both perturbation and the multiplier estimation.;math.OC
1801.02228;On cubic Thue equations and the common index divisors of cyclic cubic fields;In this paper, we investigate the common index divisors of cyclic cubic fields. Let $a,b,c,d$ and $k$ are integers, we then solve the following Thue cubic equations:: \[ax^3+bx^2y+cxy^2+dy^3= k\ \] when $a,bc+d$ are odd and $3$ doesn't divide $v_2(k)$.;math.NT
1801.02229;Packet Speed and Cost in Mobile Wireless Delay-Tolerant Networks;A mobile wireless delay-tolerant network (DTN) model is proposed and analyzed, in which infinitely many nodes are initially placed on R^2 according to a uniform Poisson point process (PPP) and subsequently travel, independently of each other, along trajectories comprised of line segments, changing travel direction at time instances that form a Poisson process, each time selecting a new travel direction from an arbitrary distribution, all nodes maintain constant speed. A single information packet is traveling towards a given direction using both wireless transmissions and sojourns on node buffers, according to a member of a broad class of possible routing rules. For this model, we compute the long-term averages of the speed with which the packet travels towards its destination and the rate with which the wireless transmission cost accumulates. Because of the complexity of the problem, we employ two intuitive, simplifying approximations, simulations verify that the approximation error is typically small. Our results quantify the fundamental trade-off that exists in mobile wireless DTNs between the packet speed and the packet delivery cost. The framework developed here is both general and versatile, and can be used as a starting point for further investigation.;cs.IT
1801.02231;Common Divisors of Values Polynomials and common factors of indices in a Number Field;Let $\mathbb{K}$ be a number field of degree $n$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. Let $\widehat{\mathbb{A}}$ be the set of integers of $\mathbb{K}$ which are primitive over $\mathbb{Q}$ and $I(\mathbb{K})$ be its index. Gunji and McQuillan defined the following integer $i(\mathbb{K})=\underset{\theta\in \widehat{\mathbb{A}}}{\text{lcm}}\,i(\theta)$, where $i(\theta)=\underset{x\in \mathbb{Z}}{\text{gcd}}\,F_\theta(x)$ and $F_\theta(x)$ is the characteristic polynomial of $\theta$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. We prove that if $p$ is a prime number less than or equal to $n$ then there exists a number field $\mathbb{K}$ of degree $n$ for which $p$ divides $i(\mathbb{K})$. We compute $i(\mathbb{K})$ for cubic fields. Also we determine $I(\mathbb{K})$ and $i(\mathbb{K})$ for families of simplest number fields of degree less than $7$. We give also answers to questions one and two in \cite{Kihel}. Furthermore, we give a counter example to Theorem 11 in \cite{Kihel} and we discuss their conjecture.;math.NT
1801.02232;Index, Prime Ideal Factorization in simplest Quartic Fields and counting their discriminants;We consider the simplest quartic number fields $\mathbb{K}_m$ defined by the irreducible quartic polynomials $$x^4-mx^3-6x^2+mx+1,$$ where $m$ runs over the positive rational integers such that the odd part of $m^2+16$ is squarefree. In this paper, we study the common index divisor $I(\mathbb K_m)$ and determine explicitly the prime ideal decomposition for any prime number in any simplest quartic number fields $\mathbb{K}_m$. On the other hand, we establish an asymptotic formula for the number of simplest quartic fields with discriminant $\leq x$ and given index.;math.NT
1801.02244;Symmetric Khovanov--Rozansky link homologies;We provide a finite dimensional categorification of the symmetric evaluation of $\mathfrak{sl}_N$-webs using foam technology. As an output we obtain a symmetric link homology theory categorifying the link invariant associated to symmetric powers of the standard representation of $\mathfrak{sl}_N$. In addition, the construction is actually made in an equivariant setting. We prove also that there is a spectral sequence from the Khovanov-Rozansky triply graded link homology to the symmetric one and provide along the way a foam interpretation of Soergel bimodules.;math.GT
1801.02245;Essential dimension in mixed characteristic;Suppose $G$ is a finite group and $p$ is either a prime number or $0$. For $p$ positive, we say that $G$ is weakly tame at $p$ if $G$ has no non-trivial normal $p$-subgroups. By convention we say that every finite group is weakly tame at $0$. Now suppose that $G$ is a finite group which is weakly tame at the residue characteristic of a discrete valuation ring $R$. Our main result shows that the essential dimension of $G$ over the fraction field $K$ of $R$ is at least as large as the essential dimension of $G$ over the residue field $k$. We also prove a more general statement of this type for a class of \'etale gerbes over $R$. <br />As a corollary, we show that, if $G$ is weakly tame at $p$ and $k$ is any field of characteristic $p &gt,0$ containing the algebraic closure of $\mathbb{F}_p$, then the essential dimension of $G$ over $k$ is less than or equal to the essential dimension of $G$ over any characteristic $0$ field. A conjecture of A. Ledet asserts that the essential dimension, $\mathrm{ed}_k(\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z})$, of the cyclic group of order $p^n$ over a field $k$ is equal to $n$ whenever $k$ is a field of characteristic $p$. We show that this conjecture implies that $\mathrm{ed}_{\mathbb{C}}(G) \geq n$ for any finite group $G$ which is weakly tame at $p$ and contains an element of order $p^n$. To the best of our knowledge, an unconditional proof of the last inequality is out of the reach of all presently known techniques.;math.AG
1801.02247;A sharpening of a problem on Bernstein polynomials and convex function and related results;We present a short proof of a conjecture proposed by I. Ra\c{s}a (2017), which is an inequality involving basic Bernstein polynomials and convex functions. This proof was given in the letter to I. Ra\c{s}a (2017). The methods of our proof allow us to obtain some extended versions of this inequality as well as other inequalities given by I. Ra\c{s}a. As a tool we use stochastic convex ordering relations. We propose also some generalizations of the binomial convex concentration inequality. We use it to insert some additional expressions between left and right sides of the Ra\c{s}a inequalities.;math.CA
1801.02252;Spaces with polynomial hulls that contain no analytic discs;Extensions of the notions of polynomially and rationally convex hulls are introduced. Using these notions, a generalization of a result of Duval and Levenberg on polynomially convex hulls containing no analytic discs is presented. As a consequence it is shown that there exists a Cantor set $X$ in ${\mathbb C}^3$ with a nontrivial polynomially convex hull that contains no analytic discs. Using this Cantor set, it is shown that there exist arcs and curves in ${\mathbb C}^4$ with nontrivial polynomially convex hulls that contain no analytic discs. This answers a question raised a few years ago by Bercovici and can be regarded as a partial answer to a question raised by Wermer over 60 years ago. More generally, it is shown that every uncountable, compact subspace of a Euclidean space can be embedded as a subspace $X$ of ${\mathbb C}^N$, for some N, in such a way as to have a nontrivial polynomially convex hull that contains no analytic discs. In the case when the topological dimension of the space is at most one, $X$ can be chosen so as to have the stronger property that $P(X)$ has a dense set of invertible elements.;math.CV
1801.02259;A Dual Approximate Dynamic Programming Approach to Multi-stage Stochastic Unit Commitment;We study the multi-stage stochastic unit commitment problem in which commitment and generation decisions can be made and adjusted in each time period. We formulate this problem as a Markov decision process, which is "weakly-coupled" in the sense that if the demand constraint is relaxed, the problem decomposes into a separate, low-dimensional, Markov decision process for each generator. We demonstrate how the dual approximate dynamic programming method of Barty, Carpentier, and Girardeau (RAIRO Operations Research, 44:167-183, 2010) can be adapted to obtain bounds and a policy for this problem. Previous approaches have let the Lagrange multipliers depend only on time, this can result in weak lower bounds. Other approaches have let the multipliers depend on the entire history of past random observations, although this provides a strong lower bound, its ability to handle a large number of sample paths or scenarios is limited. We demonstrate how to bridge these approaches for the stochastic unit commitment problem by letting the multipliers depend on the current observed demand. This allows a good tradeoff between strong lower bounds and good scalability with the number of scenarios. We illustrate this approach numerically on a 168-stage stochastic unit commitment problem, including minimum uptime, downtime, and ramping constraints.;math.OC
1801.02260;Divisibility classes are seldom closed under flat covers;It is well-known that a class of all modules, which are torsion-free with respect to a set of ideals, is closed under injective envelopes. In this paper, we consider a kind of a dual to this statement - are the divisibility classes closed under flat covers? - and argue that this is seldom the case. More precisely, we show that the class of all divisible modules over an integral domain R is closed under flat covers if and only if R is almost perfect. Also, we show that if the class of all s-divisible modules, where s is a regular element of a commutative ring R, is closed under flat covers then the quotient ring R/sR satisfies some rather restrictive properties. The question is motivated by the recent classification [11] of tilting classes over commutative rings.;math.AC

Furthermore, this paper will examine the existence of magic polygons, along with several other properties inherent to magic polygons.;math.CO

1801.02274;Cancellation for surfaces revisited. II;Let $X$ and $X'$ be affine algebraic varieties over a field $\mathbb{k}$. The celebrated Zariski Cancellation Problem asks as to when the existence of an isomorphism $X\times\mathbb{A}^n\cong X'\times\mathbb{A}^n$ implies $X\cong X'$. In Part I of this paper (<a href="/abs/1610.01805">arXiv:1610.01805</a>) we provided a criterion for cancellation in the case where $X$ is a normal affine surface admitting an $\mathbb{A}^1$-fibration $X\to B$ over a smooth affine curve $B$. If $X$ does not admit such an $\mathbb{A}^1$-fibration then the cancellation by the affine line is known to hold for $X$ by a result of Bandman and Makar-Limanov. In the present Part II we classify all pairs $(X,X')$ of smooth affine surfaces $\mathbb{A}^1$-fibered over $B$ with only reduced fibers whose cylinders $X\times\mathbb{A}^1$, $X'\times\mathbb{A}^1$ are isomorphic over $B$. Our criterion of isomorphism of cylinders over $B$ is expressed in terms of linear equivalence of certain divisors on the Danielewski-Fieseler quotient of $X$ over $B$. Under a mild restriction we construct a coarse moduli of such surfaces.;math.AG

We give a explicit construction of Verma modules over the ${\mathbb Z}_2 \otimes {\mathbb Z}_2$ graded superalgebra and show their reducibility by using singular vectors. The explicit formula of singular vectors are given and are used to derive partial differential equations invariant under the color supergroup generated by the ${\mathbb Z}_2 \otimes {\mathbb Z}_2$ graded superalgebra.;math-ph
1801.02276;Bounds for Laplace eigenvalues of Kaehler metrics;We prove inequalities for Laplace eigenvalues of Kaehler manifolds generalising to higher eigenvalues the classical inequality for the first Laplace eigenvalue due to Bourguignon, Li, and Yau in 1994. We also obtain similar inequalities for analytic varieties in Kaehler manifolds.;math.DG
1801.02278;Banach Spaces from Barriers in High Dimensional Ellentuck Spaces;A new hierarchy of Banach spaces $T_k(d,\theta)$, $k$ any positive integer, is constructed using barriers in high dimensional Ellentuck spaces \cite{DobrinenJSL15} following the classical framework under which a Tsirelson type norm is defined from a barrier in the Ellentuck space \cite{Argyros/TodorcevicBK}. The following structural properties of these spaces are proved. Each of these spaces contains arbitrarily large copies of $\ell_\infty^n$, with the bound constant for all $n$. For each fixed pair $d$ and $\theta$, the spaces $T_k(d,\theta)$, $k\ge 1$, are $\ell_p$-saturated, forming natural extensions of the $\ell_p$ space, where $p$ satisfies $d\theta=d^{1/p}$. Moreover, they form a strict hierarchy over the $\ell_p$ space: For any $j&lt,k$, the space $T_j(d,\theta)$ embeds isometrically into $T_k(d,\theta)$ as a subspace which is non-isomorphic to $T_k(d,\theta)$.;math.LO
1801.02282;Arithmetic surfaces and adelic quotient groups;We explicitly calculate an arithmetic adelic quotient group for a locally free sheaf on an arithmetic surface when the fiber over the infinite point of the base is taken into account. The calculations are presented via a short exact sequence. We relate the last term of this short exact sequence with the projective limit of groups which are finite direct products of copies of one-dimensional real torus and are connected with first cohomology groups of locally free sheaves on the arithmetic surface.;math.AG
1801.02283;Computing the average root number of an elliptic surface;By considering a one-parameter family of elliptic curves defined over $\mathbb{Q}$, we might ask ourselves if there is any bias in the distribution (or parity) of the root numbers at each specialization. From the work of Helfgott, we know (at least conjecturally) that the average root number of an elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb{Q}(T)$ is zero as soon as there is a place of multiplicative reduction over $\mathbb{Q}(T)$ other than $-$deg. Recently, Helfgott's work was extended by Desjardins, where she relaxes some of Helfgott's hypotheses and is able to provide unconditional results on the variation of the root number for many elliptic surfaces. <br />In this paper, we are concerned with elliptic curves defined over $\mathbb{Q}(T)$ with no place of multiplicative reduction over $\mathbb{Q}(T)$, except possibly at $-$deg. More precisely, we will use the work of Helfgott to compute the average root number of an explicit family of elliptic curves defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ and show that this family is "parity-biased" infinitely-often.;math.NT
1801.02285;Global existence and well-posedness for the Doi-Edwards polymer model;In this paper we mainly investigate the Cauchy problem of the Doi-Edwards polymer model with dimension $d\geq2$. The model was derived in the late 1970s to describe the dynamics of polymers in melts. The system contain a Navier-Stokes equation with an additional stress tensor which depend on the deformation gradient tensor and the memory function. The deformation gradient tensor satisfies a transport equation and the memory function satisfies a degenerate parabolic equation. We first proved the local well-posedness for the Doi-Edwards polymer model in Besov spaces by using the Littlewood-Paley theory. Moreover, if the initial velocity and the initial memory is small enough, we obtain a global existence result.;math.AP
1801.02287;Explicit Constructions of MBR and MSR Codes for Clustered Distributed Storage;This paper considers capacity-achieving coding for the clustered form of distributed storage that reflects practical storage networks. To reflect the clustered structure with limited cross-cluster communication bandwidths, nodes in the same cluster are set to communicate $\beta_I$ symbols, while nodes in other clusters can communicate $\beta_c \leq \beta_I$ symbols with one another. We provide two types of exact regenerating codes which achieve the capacity of clustered distributed storage: the minimum-bandwidth-regenerating (MBR) codes and the minimum-storage-regenerating (MSR) codes. First, we construct MBR codes for general parameter settings of clustered distributed storage. The suggested MBR code is a generalization of an existing code proposed by Rashmi et al., for scenarios where storage nodes are dispersed into L &gt, 1 clusters. The proposed MBR code for the $\beta_c = 0$ case requires a much smaller field size compared to existing local MBR codes. Secondly, we devise MSR codes for clustered distributed storage. Focus is given on two important cases:$\epsilon=0$ and $\epsilon \in [1/(n-k), 1]$, where $\epsilon=\beta_c/\beta_I$ is the ratio of the available cross- to intra-cluster repair bandwidths, n is the total number of distributed nodes and k is the number of contact nodes in data retrieval. The former represents the scenario where cross-cluster communication is not allowed, while the latter corresponds to the case of minimum node storage overhead. For $\epsilon=0$, two existing locally repairable codes are proven to be MSR codes for the clustered model. For $\epsilon \in [1/(n-k), 1]$, existing MSR codes for the non-clustered model are applicable to clustered scenarios with a simple modification.;cs.IT
1801.02297;Convergence rates in homogenization of higher order parabolic systems;This paper is concerned with the optimal convergence rate in homogenization of higher order parabolic systems with bounded measurable, rapidly oscillating periodic coefficients. The sharp $O(\va)$ convergence rate in the space $L^2(0,T, H^{m-1}(\Om))$ is obtained for both the initial-Dirichlet problem and the initial-Neumann problem. The duality argument inspired by \cite{suslinaD2013} is used here.;math.AP
1801.02298;Depth Sequence Coding with Hierarchical Partitioning and Spatial-domain Quantisation;Depth coding in 3D-HEVC for the multiview video plus depth (MVD) architecture (i) deforms object shapes due to block-level edge-approximation, (ii) misses an opportunity for high compressibility at near-lossless quality by failing to exploit strong homogeneity (clustering tendency) in depth syntax, motion vector components, and residuals at frame-level, and (iii) restricts interactivity and limits responsiveness of independent use of depth information for "non-viewing" applications due to texture-depth coding dependency. This paper presents a standalone depth sequence coder, which operates in the lossless to near-lossless quality range while compressing depth data superior to lossy 3D-HEVC. It preserves edges implicitly by limiting quantisation to the spatial-domain and exploits clustering tendency efficiently at frame-level with a novel binary tree based decomposition (BTBD) technique. For mono-view coding of standard MVD test sequences, on average, (i) lossless BTBD achieved $\times 42.2$ compression-ratio and $-60.0\%$ coding gain against the pseudo-lossless 3D-HEVC, using the lowest quantisation parameter $QP = 1$, and (ii) near-lossless BTBD achieved $-79.4\%$ and $6.98$ dB Bj{\o}ntegaard delta bitrate (BD-BR) and distortion (BD-PSNR), respectively, against 3D-HEVC. In view-synthesis applications, decoded depth maps from BTBD rendered superior quality synthetic-views, compared to 3D-HEVC, with $-18.9\%$ depth BD-BR and $0.43$ dB synthetic-texture BD-PSNR on average.;cs.IT
1801.02301;An estimate on energy of min-max Seiberg-Witten Floer generators;Previously, Cristofaro-Gardiner, Hutchings and Ramos have proved that embedded contact homology (ECH) capacities can recover the volume of a contact 3-manifod in their paper "the asymptotics of ECH capacities" . There were two main steps to proving this theorem: The first step used an estimate for the energy of min-max Seiberg-Witten Floer generators. The second step used embedded balls in a certain symplectic four manifold. <br />In this paper, stronger estimates on the energy of min-max Seiberg-Witten Floer generators are derived. This stronger estimate implies directly the "ECH capacities recover volume" theorem (without the help of embedded balls in a certain symplectic four manifold), and moreover, gives an estimate on its speed.;math.SG
1801.02306;Linear-Quadratic Mean Field Control: The Hamiltonian Matrix and Invariant Subspace Method;This paper studies the existence and uniqueness of a solution to linear quadratic (LQ) mean field social optimization problems with uniform agents.

1801.02307;Geometric Quantization;Geometric quantization is an attempt at using the differential-geometric ingredients of classical phase spaces regarded as symplectic manifolds in order to define a corresponding quantum theory. Generally, the process of geometric quantization is applicable to other symplectic manifolds, not only cotangent spaces. The resulting formalism provides a way of looking at quantum theory that is distinct from conventional approaches to the subject, e.g., the Dirac bra-ket formalism. In particular, such familiar features as the quantization of spin, the canonical quantization of position and momentum, and the Schr\"{o}dinger equation all emerge from geometric quantization. This paper serves as a review of the subject written in an informal style, often taking an example-based approach to exposition, and attempts to present the material without assuming the reader is an expert in differential geometry.;math-ph
1801.02308;Joint Transmitter and Receiver Design for Pattern Division Multiple Access;In this paper, a joint transmitter and receiver design for pattern division multiple access (PDMA) is proposed. At the transmitter, pattern mapping utilizes power allocation to improve the overall sum rate, and beam allocation to enhance the access connectivity. At the receiver, hybrid detection utilizes a spatial filter to suppress the inter-beam interference caused by beam domain multiplexing, and successive interference cancellation to remove the intra-beam interference caused by power domain multiplexing. Furthermore, we propose a PDMA joint design approach to optimize pattern mapping based on both the power domain and beam domain. The optimization of power allocation is achieved by maximizing the overall sum rate, and the corresponding optimization problem is shown to be convex theoretically. The optimization of beam allocation is achieved by minimizing the maximum of the inner product of any two beam allocation vectors, and an effective dimension reduction method is proposed through the analysis of pattern structure and proper mathematical manipulations. Simulation results show that the proposed PDMA approach outperforms the orthogonal multiple access and power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access approaches even without any optimization of pattern mapping, and that the optimization of beam allocation yields a significant performance improvement than the optimization of power allocation.;cs.IT
1801.02310;Efficient Encoding/Decoding of Irreducible Words for Codes Correcting Tandem Duplications;Tandem duplication is the process of inserting a copy of a segment of DNA adjacent to the original position. Motivated by applications that store data in living organisms, Jain et al. (2017) proposed the study of codes that correct tandem duplications. Known code constructions are based on {\em irreducible words}. <br />We study efficient encoding/decoding methods for irreducible words. First, we describe an $(\ell,m)$-finite state encoder and show that when $m=\Theta(1/\epsilon)$ and $\ell=\Theta(1/\epsilon)$, the encoder achieves rate that is $\epsilon$ away from the optimal. Next, we provide ranking/unranking algorithms for irreducible words and modify the algorithms to reduce the space requirements for the finite state encoder.;cs.IT
1801.02312;Newton diagram of positivity for ${}_1F_2$ generalized hypergeometric functions;As for the positivity of ${}_1F_2$ generalized hypergeometric functions, we present a list of necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of parameters and determine the region of positivity by certain Newton diagram.;math.CA
1801.02313;Probability distributions of multi-species q-TAZRP and ASEP as double cosets of parabolic subgroups;We write explicit contour integral formulas for probability distributions of the multi-species q-TAZRP and the multi-species ASEP starting with q-exchangeable initial conditions. The formulas are equal to the corresponding explicit contour integral formulas for the single-species q-TAZRP ([Korhonen-Lee 2014, Wang-Waugh 2016]) and ASEP [Tracy-Widom 2007], with a factor in front of the integral. <br />For the multi-species q-TAZRP, we use a decomposition theorem for elements of double cosets of parabolic subgroups in a Coxeter group. The set of distinguished double coset representatives with minimal length is viewed as a particle configuration. For the multi-species ASEP we use a more direct proof.;math.PR
1801.02314;A Mixed Finite Element Method for Multi-Cavity Computation in Incompressible Nonlinear Elasticity;A mixed finite element method combining an iso-parametric $Q_2$-$P_1$ element and an iso-parametric $P_2^+$-$P_1$ element is developed for the computation of multiple cavities in incompressible nonlinear elasticity. The method is analytically proved to be locking-free and convergent, and it is also shown to be numerically accurate and efficient by numerical experiments. Furthermore, the newly developed accurate method enables us to find an interesting new bifurcation phenomenon in multi-cavity growth.;math.AP
1801.02315;Generalized Reed-Solomon Codes with Sparsest and Balanced Generator Matrices;We prove that for any positive integers $n$ and $k$ such that $n\!\geq\! k\!\geq\! 1$, there exists an $[n,k]$ generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) code that has a sparsest and balanced generator matrix (SBGM) over any finite field of size $q\!\geq\! n\!+\!\lceil\frac{k(k-1)}{n}\rceil$, where sparsest means that each row of the generator matrix has the least possible number of nonzeros, while balanced means that the number of nonzeros in any two columns differ by at most one. Previous work by Dau et al (ISIT'13) showed that there always exists an MDS code that has an SBGM over any finite field of size $q\geq {n-1\choose k-1}$, and Halbawi et al (ISIT'16, ITW'16) showed that there exists a cyclic Reed-Solomon code (i.e., $n=q-1$) with an SBGM for any prime power $q$. Hence, this work extends both of the previous results.;cs.IT
1801.02321;Log-Scale Shrinkage Priors and Adaptive Bayesian Global-Local Shrinkage Estimation;Global-local shrinkage hierarchies are an important innovation in Bayesian estimation. We propose the use of log-scale distributions as a novel basis for generating familes of prior distributions for local shrinkage hyperparameters. By varying the scale parameter one may vary the degree to which the prior distribution promotes sparsity in the coefficient estimates. By examining the class of distributions over the logarithm of the local shrinkage parameter that have log-linear, or sub-log-linear tails, we show that many standard prior distributions for local shrinkage parameters can be unified in terms of the tail behaviour and concentration properties of their corresponding marginal distributions over the coefficients $\beta_j$. We derive upper bounds on the rate of concentration around $|\beta_j|=0$, and the tail decay as $|\beta_j| \to \infty$, achievable by this wide class of prior distributions. <br />We then propose a new type of ultra-heavy tailed prior, called the log-$t$ prior with the property that, irrespective of the choice of associated scale parameter, the marginal distribution always diverges at $\beta_j = 0$, and always possesses super-Cauchy tails. We develop results demonstrating when prior distributions with (sub)-log-linear tails attain Kullback--Leibler super-efficiency and prove that the log-$t$ prior distribution is always super-efficient. We show that the log-$t$ prior is less sensitive to misspecification of the global shrinkage parameter than the horseshoe or lasso priors. By incorporating the scale parameter of the log-scale prior distributions into the Bayesian hierarchy we derive novel adaptive shrinkage procedures. Simulations show that the adaptive log-$t$ procedure appears to always perform well, irrespective of the level of sparsity or signal-to-noise ratio of the underlying model.;math.ST
1801.02323;Representation category of the quantum double of ${\rm SL}(2,q)$;For each odd prime power $q$ with $q\ge 5$ and $4\mid q-1$, we investigate the structure of the representation category of the quantum double of ${\rm SL}(2,q)$, determining its tensor products and braidings.;math.RT
1801.02324;Building Capacity-Achieving PIR Schemes with Optimal Sub-Packetization over Small Fields;Suppose a database containing $M$ records is replicated across $N$ servers, and a user wants to privately retrieve one record by accessing the servers such that identity of the retrieved record is secret against any up to $T$ servers. A scheme designed for this purpose is called a $T$-private information retrieval ($T$-PIR) scheme. Three indexes are concerned for PIR schemes: (1)rate, indicating the amount of retrieved information per unit of downloaded data. The highest achievable rate is characterized by the capacity, (2) sub-packetization, reflexing the implementation complexity for linear schemes, (3) field size. We consider linear schemes over a finite field. In this paper, a general $T$-PIR scheme simultaneously attaining the optimality of almost all of the three indexes is presented. Specifically, we design a linear capacity-achieving $T$-PIR scheme with sub-packetization $\!dn^{M-1}\!$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, $q\geq N$. The sub-packetization $\!dn^{M-1}\!$, where $\!d\!=\!{\rm gcd}(N,T)\!$ and $\!n\!=\!N/d$, has been proved to be optimal in our previous work. The field size of all existing capacity-achieving $T$-PIR schemes must be larger than $Nt^{M-2}$ where $t=T/d$, while our scheme reduces the field size by an exponential factor.;cs.IT

1801.02329;Grassmannian Codes with New Distance Measures for Network Coding;Grassmannian codes are known to be useful in error-correction for random network coding. Recently, they were used to prove that vector network codes outperform scalar linear network codes, on multicast networks, with respect to the alphabet size. The multicast networks which were used for this purpose are generalized combination networks. In both the scalar and the vector network coding solutions, the subspace distance is used as the distance measure for the codes which solve the network coding problem in the generalized combination networks. In this work we show that the subspace distance can be replaced with two other possible distance measures which generalize the subspace distance. These two distance measures are shown to be equivalent under an orthogonal transformation. It is proved that the Grassmannian codes with the new distance measures generalize the Grassmannian codes with the subspace distance and the subspace designs with the strength of the design. Furthermore, optimal Grassmannian codes with the new distance measureshave minimal requirements for network coding solutions of some generalized combination networks. The coding problems related to these two distance measures, especially with respect to network coding, are discussed. Finally, by using these new concepts it is proved that codes in the Hamming scheme form a subfamily of the Grassmannian codes.;cs.IT
1801.02331;Global Asymptotic Stability for General Linear MIMO Distributed Systems: An Approach Based on Robust-Adaptive Controllers;Stability is a critical feature of distributed linear multi-input-multi-output systems. Global asymptotic stability usually can be guaranteed when using decentralised or distributed control architectures, if: (i) conservative controllers are designed, (ii) collective stability conditions are satisfied, or (iii) interaction terms are neutral. This paper extends the collective stability method to incorporate adaptive controllers, and shows that this method is insufficient for systems with large-gain interconnections. Subsequently, we show that global asymptotic stability can be systematically ensured by exploiting vector Lyapunov functions and algebraic Riccati equations. This leads to a scalable distributed architecture where local controllers require information from corresponding subsystems and neighbouring controllers. Conveniently, the communication flow has the same topology as the interconnection graph. Theoretical results are validated through application of the proposed architecture to voltage control of a DC power network.;math.OC
1801.02333;The inertialess limit of particle sedimentation modeled by the Vlasov-Stokes equations;We study the Vlasov-Stokes equations which macroscopically model the sedimentation of a cloud of particles in a fluid, where particle inertia are taken into account but fluid inertia are assumed to be negligible. We consider the limit when the inertia of the particles tends to zero, and obtain convergence of the dynamics to the solution of an associated inertialess system of equations. This system coincides with the model that can be derived as the homogenization limit of the microscopic inertialess dynamics.;math.AP
1801.02339;A correction of the decomposability result in a paper by Meyer-Neutsch;In this short note, it is shown that there is a gap in the proof of Theorem 11 in the paper of Meyer and Neutsch (J. of Algebra, 1993). We prove, nevertheless, that the statement of the theorem is true and fix the proof by using a certain extremal property of idempotents which has an independent interest.;math.RA
1801.02340;Lifting a prescribed group of automorphisms of graphs;In this paper we are interested in lifting a prescribed group of automorphisms of a finite graph via regular covering projections. Here we describe with an example the problems we address and refer to the introductory section for the correct statements of our results. <br />Let $P$ be the Petersen graph, say, and let $\wp:\tilde{P}\to P$ be a regular covering projection. With the current covering machinery, it is straightforward to find $\wp$ with the property that every subgroup of $\Aut(P)$ lifts via $\wp$. However, for constructing peculiar examples and in applications, this is usually not enough. Sometimes it is important, given a subgroup $G$ of $\Aut(P)$, to find $\wp$ along which $G$ lifts but no further automorphism of $P$ does. For instance, in this concrete example, it is interesting to find a covering of the Petersen graph lifting the alternating group $A_5$ but not the whole symmetric group $S_5$. (Recall that $\Aut(P)\cong S_5$.) Some other time it is important, given a subgroup $G$ of $\Aut(P)$, to find $\wp$ with the property that $\Aut(\tilde{P})$ is the lift of $G$. Typically, it is desirable to find $\wp$ satisfying both conditions. In a very broad sense, this might remind wallpaper patterns on surfaces: the group of symmetries of the dodecahedron is $S_5$, and there is a nice colouring of the dodecahedron (found also by Escher) whose group of symmetries is just $A_5$. <br />In this paper, we address this problem in full generality.;math.CO

Hereinafter the conditions are determined for convergence of Galerkin and collocation methods for solving Fredholm integral equations of the first kind for simple layer potential that is equivalent to Dirichlet problem for Laplace equation in R3. Estimation is determined for the error of approximate solution of this problem obtained using potential theory methods.;math.NA

1801.02347;Groups acting on rooted trees and their representations on the boundary;We consider groups that act on spherically symmetric rooted trees and study the associated representation of the group on the space of locally constant functions on the boundary of the tree. We introduce and discuss the new notion of locally 2-transitive actions. Assuming local 2-transitivity our main theorem yields a precise decomposition of the boundary representation into irreducible constituents. <br />The method can be used to study Gelfand pairs and enables us to answer a question of Grigorchuk. To provide examples, we analyse in detail the local 2-transitivity of GGS-groups. Moreover, our results can be used to determine explicit formulae for zeta functions of induced representations defined by Klopsch and the author.;math.GR

To achieve this, first we propose a suitable meaning of a weak solution, show their existence and uniqueness, and establish a probabilistic representation in terms of time-changed Brownian motion. As an application, we also discuss an inverse source problem.;math.AP

In this paper, we formulate a game when NOMA is applied to ALOHA to decide the transmission probability. We consider a payoff function based on an energy-efficiency metric and drive the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (NE).;cs.IT
1801.02353;Exponential stability of general 1-D quasilinear systems with source terms for the $C^1$ norm under boundary conditions;We address the question of the exponential stability for the $C^{1}$ norm of general 1-D quasilinear systems with source terms under boundary conditions. To reach this aim, we introduce the notion of basic $C^{1}$ Lyapunov functions, a generic kind of exponentially decreasing function whose existence ensures the exponential stability of the system for the $C^{1}$ norm. We show that the existence of a basic $C^{1}$ Lyapunov function is subject to two conditions: an interior condition, intrinsic to the system, and a condition on the boundary controls. We give explicit sufficient interior and boundary conditions such that the system is exponentially stable for the $C^{1}$ norm and we show that the interior condition is also necessary to the existence of a basic $C^{1}$ Lyapunov function. Finally, we show that the results conducted in this article are also true under the same conditions for the exponential stability in the $C^{p}$ norm, for any $p\geq1$.;math.AP
1801.02357;Numerically destabilizing minimal discs;When calculating the index of a minimal surface, the set of smooth functions on a domain with compact support is the standard setting to describe admissible variations. We show that the set of admissible variations can be widened in a geometrically meaningful manner by considering the difference of area functional, leading to a more general notion of index. This allows us to produce explicit examples of destabilizing perturbations for the fundamental Scherk surface and dihedral Enneper surfaces. In the case of dihedral Enneper surfaces we show that both the classical and our modified index can be explicitly determined.;math.DG

Observed time series are subordinated to long-range dependent Gaussian processes and characterized by arbitrary marginal copula distributions. First of all, we establish limit theorems for the marginal and quantile marginal empirical processes of multivariate stationary long-range dependent sequences under Gaussian subordination. Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic behavior of sequential empirical copula processes under non-restrictive smoothness assumptions. The limiting processes in the case of long-memory sequences are quite different from the cases of of i.i.d. and weakly dependent observations.;math.ST

We establish the conditions under which the trace $i^!(\Phi)$ is also a Fourier integral operator and calculate its amplitude in canonical local coordinates.;math.AP
1801.02369;Elementary matrix factorizations over B&#xe9,zout domains;We study the homotopy category $\mathrm{hef}(R,W)$ (and its $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded version $\mathrm{HEF}(R,W)$) of elementary factorizations, where $R$ is a B\'ezout domain which has prime elements and $W=W_0 W_c$, where $W_0\in R^\times$ is a square-free element of $R$ and $W_c\in R^\times$ is a finite product of primes with order at least two. In this situation, we give criteria for detecting isomorphisms in $\mathrm{hef}(R,W)$ and $\mathrm{HEF}(R,W)$ and formulas for the number of isomorphism classes of objects. We also study the full subcategory $\mathbf{hef}(R,W)$ of the homotopy category $\mathrm{hmf}(R,W)$ of finite rank matrix factorizations of $W$ which is additively generated by elementary factorizations. We show that $\mathbf{hef}(R,W)$ is Krull-Schmidt and we conjecture that it coincides with $\mathrm{hmf}(R,W)$. Finally, we discuss a few classes of examples.;math.AC
1801.02370;Approximately locating an invisible agent in a graph with relative distance queries;In a pursuit evasion game on a finite, simple, undirected, and connected graph $G$, a first player visits vertices $m_1,m_2,\ldots$ of $G$, where $m_{i+1}$ is in the closed neighborhood of $m_i$ for every $i$, and a second player probes arbitrary vertices $c_1,c_2,\ldots$ of $G$, and learns whether or not the distance between $c_{i+1}$ and $m_{i+1}$ is at most the distance between $c_i$ and $m_i$. Up to what distance $d$ can the second player determine the position of the first? For trees of bounded maximum degree and grids, we show that $d$ is bounded by a constant. We conjecture that $d=O(\log n)$ for every graph $G$ of order $n$, and show that $d=0$ if $m_{i+1}$ may differ from $m_i$ only if $i$ is a multiple of some sufficiently large integer.;math.CO
1801.02373;Discrete Gaussian distributions via theta functions;We study a discrete analogue of the classical multivariate Gaussian distribution. It is supported on the integer lattice and is parametrized by the Riemann theta function. Over the reals, the discrete Gaussian is characterized by the property of maximizing entropy, just as its continuous counterpart. We capitalize on the theta function representation to derive statistical properties. Throughout, we exhibit strong connections to the study of abelian varieties in algebraic geometry.;math.AG
1801.02376;The Explicit Coding Rate Region of Symmetric Multilevel Diversity Coding;It is well known that {\em superposition coding}, namely separately encoding the independent sources, is optimal for symmetric multilevel diversity coding (SMDC) (Yeung-Zhang 1999). However, the characterization of the coding rate region therein involves uncountably many linear inequalities and the constant term (i.e., the lower bound) in each inequality is given in terms of the solution of a linear optimization problem. Thus this implicit characterization of the coding rate region does not enable the determination of the achievability of a given rate tuple. In this paper, we first obtain closed-form expressions of these uncountably many inequalities. Then we identify a finite subset of inequalities that is sufficient for characterizing the coding rate region. This gives an explicit characterization of the coding rate region. We further show by the symmetry of the problem that only a much smaller subset of this finite set of inequalities needs to be verified in determining the achievability of a given rate tuple. Yet, the cardinality of this smaller set grows at least exponentially fast with $L$. We also present a subset entropy inequality, which together with our explicit characterization of the coding rate region, is sufficient for proving the optimality of superposition coding.;cs.IT
1801.02379;How fast planar maps get swallowed by a peeling process;The peeling process is an algorithmic procedure that discovers a random planar map step by step. In generic cases such as the UIPT or the UIPQ, it is known [Curien &amp, Le Gall, Scaling limits for the peeling process on random maps, Ann. Inst. Henri Poincar\'e Probab. Stat. 53, 1 (2017), 322-357] that any peeling process will eventually discover the whole map. In this paper we study the probability that the origin is not swallowed by the peeling process until time $n$ and show it decays at least as $n^{-2c/3}$ where \[c \approx 0.12831235141783245423674486573872854933142662048339843...\] is defined via an integral equation derived using the Lamperti representation of the spectrally negative $3/2$-stable L\'evy process conditioned to remain positive [Chaumont, Kyprianou &amp, Pardo, Some explicit identities associated with positive self-similar Markov processes, Stochastic Process. Appl. 119, 3 (2009), 980-1000] which appears as a scaling limit for the perimeter process. As an application we sharpen the upper bound of the sub-diffusivity exponent for random walk of [Benjamini &amp, Curien, Simple random walk on the uniform infinite planar quadrangulation: subdiffusivity via pioneer points, Geom. Funct. Anal. 23, 2 (2013), 501-531].;math.PR
1801.02380;Generalized P&#xf3,lya Urn Schemes with Negative but Linear Reinforcements;In this paper, we consider a new type of urn scheme, where the selection probabilities are proportional to a weight function, which is linear but decreasing in the proportion of existing colours. We refer to it as the \emph{negatively reinforced} urn scheme. We establish almost sure limit of the random configuration for any \emph{balanced} replacement matrix $R$. In particular, we show that the limiting configuration is uniform on the set of colours, if and only if, $R$ is a \emph{doubly stochastic} matrix. We further establish almost sure limit of the vector of colour counts and prove central limit theorems for the random configuration, as well as, for the colour counts.;math.PR
1801.02394;Age-Optimal Updates of Multiple Information Flows;In this paper, we study an age of information minimization problem, where multiple flows of update packets are sent over multiple servers to their destinations. Two online scheduling policies are proposed. When the packet generation and arrival times are synchronized across the flows, the proposed policies are shown to be (near) optimal for minimizing any time-dependent, symmetric, and non-decreasing penalty function of the ages of the flows over time in a stochastic ordering sense.;cs.IT
1801.02401;The Extremal Function for the Complex Ball for Generalized Notions of Degree and Multivariate Polynomial Approximation;We discuss the Siciak-Zaharjuta extremal function of pluripotential theory for the unit ball in C^d for spaces of polynomials with the notion of degree determined by a convex body P. We then use it to analyze the approximation properties of such polynomial spaces, and how these may differ depending on the function f to be approximated.;math.CV
1801.02402;Higher solutions of Hitchin&#x27,s self-duality equations;Solutions of Hitchin's self-duality equations corresponds to special real sections in the Deligne-Hitchin moduli space -- twistor lines. A question posed by Simpson in 1997 asks whether all real sections give rise to global solutions of the self-duality equations. An affirmative answer would allow for complex analytic procedure to obtain all solutions of the self-duality equations. The purpose of this paper is to construct counter examples given by certain (branched) Willmore surfaces in $3$-space (with monodromy) via the generalized Whitham flow. Though these higher solutions do not give rise to global solutions of the self-duality equations on the whole Riemann surface $M$, they are solutions on an open dense subset of it. This suggest a deeper connection between Willmore surfaces, i.e., rank $4$ harmonic maps theory, with the rank $2$ self-duality theory.;math.DG
1801.02405;Distinguishing density and the Distinct Spheres Condition;If a graph $G$ has distinguishing number 2, then there exists a partition of its vertex set into two parts, such that no nontrivial automorphism of $G$ fixes setwise the two parts. Such a partition is called a 2-distinguishing coloring of $G$, and the parts are called its color classes. If $G$ admits such a coloring, it is often possible to find another in which one of the color classes is sparse in a certain sense. In this case we say that $G$ has 2-distinguishing density zero. An extreme example of this would be an infinite graph admitting a 2-distinguishing coloring in which one of the color classes is finite. <br />If a graph $G$ contains a vertex $v$ such that, for all $n \in \mathbb N$, any two distinct vertices equidistant from $v$ have nonequal $n$-spheres, then we say that $G$ satisfies the Distinct Spheres Condition. In this paper we prove a general result: any countable connected graph that satisfies the Distinct Spheres Condition is 2-distinguishable with density zero. We present two proofs of this, one that uses a deterministic coloring, and another (that applies only to locally finite graphs) using a random coloring. From this result, we deduce that several important families of countably infinite and connected graphs are 2-distinguishable with density zero, including those that are locally finite and primitive. Furthermore, we prove that any connected graph with infinite motion and subquadratic growth is 2-distinguishable with density zero.;math.CO
1801.02406;Tate&#x27,s conjecture and the Tate-Shafarevich group over global function fields;Let $\mathcal X$ be a regular variety, flat and proper over a complete regular curve over a finite field, such that the generic fiber $X$ is smooth and geometrically connected. We prove that the Brauer group of $\mathcal X$ is finite if and only Tate's conjecture for divisors on $X$ holds and the Tate-Shafarevich group of the Albanese variety of $X$ is finite, generalizing a theorem of Artin and Grothendieck for surfaces to arbitrary relative dimension. We also give a formula relating the orders of the group under the assumption that they are finite, generalizing the formula given for a surface.;math.NT
1801.02410;Chains of P-points;It is proved that the Continuum Hypothesis implies that any sequence of rapid P-points of length $&lt,{\mathfrak c}^{+}$ which is increasing with respect to the Rudin-Keisler ordering is bounded above by a rapid P-point. This is an improvement of a result from [Kuzeljevi\'c, Raghavan: A long chain of P-points, arxiv:<a href="/abs/1607.07188">1607.07188</a> [math.LO]]. It is also proved that the notion of a $\delta$-generic sequence is equivalent to an apparently much weaker notion. This allows the central definition used in the construction in [Kuzeljevi\'c, Raghavan: A long chain of P-points, arxiv:<a href="/abs/1607.07188">1607.07188</a> [math.LO]] to be considerably simplified.;math.LO
1801.02412;p-adic limits of renormalized logarithmic Euler characteristics;Given a countable residually finite group $\Gamma$, we write $\Gamma_n \to e$ if $(\Gamma_n)$ is a sequence of normal subgroups of finite index such that any infinite intersection of $\Gamma_n$'s contains only the unit element $e$ of $\Gamma$. Given a $\Gamma$-module $M$ we are interested in the multiplicative Euler characteristics \begin{equation} \chi (\Gamma_n , M) = \prod_i |H_i (\Gamma_n , M)|^{(-1)^i} \end{equation} and the limit in the field $\mathbb{Q}_p$ of $p$-adic numbers \begin{equation} h_p := \lim_{n\to\infty} (\Gamma : \Gamma_n)^{-1} \log_p \chi (\Gamma_n , M) \, . \end{equation} Here $\log_p : \mathbb{Q}^{\times}_p \to \mathbb{Z}_p$ is the branch of the $p$-adic logarithm with $\log_p (p) = 0$. Of course, neither expression will exist in general. We isolate conditions on $M$, in particular $p$-adic expansiveness which guarantee that the Euler characteristics $\chi (\Gamma_n , M)$ are well defined. That notion is a $p$-adic analogue of expansiveness of the dynamical system given by the $\Gamma$-action on the compact Pontrjagin dual $X = M^*$ of $M$. Under further conditions on $\Gamma$ we also show that the renormalized $p$-adic limit in the second formula exists and equals the $p$-adic $R$-torsion of $M$. The latter is a $p$-adic analogue of the Li--Thom $L^2$ $R$-torsion of a $\Gamma$-module $M$ which they related to the entropy $h$ of the $\Gamma$-action on $X$. We view the limit $h_p$ as a version of entropy which values in the $p$-adic numbers and the equality with $p$-adic $R$-torsion as an analogue of the Li--Thom formula in the expansive case. We discuss the case $\Gamma = \mathbb{Z}^N$ in more detail where our theory is related to Serre's intersection numbers on arithmetic schemes.;math.GR
1801.02413;On flexible sequences;In the setting of nonstandard analysis we introduce the notion of flexible sequence. The terms of flexible sequences are external numbers. These are a sort of analogue for the classical \emph{O$ (\cdot ) $} and \emph{o$ (\cdot ) $} notation for functions, and have algebraic properties similar to those of real numbers. The flexibility originates from the fact that external numbers are stable under some shifts, additions and multiplications. We introduce two forms of convergence, and study their relation. We show that the usual properties of convergence of sequences hold or can be adapted to these new notions of convergence and give some applications.;math.LO
1801.02421;The N=2 supersymmetric Calogero-Sutherland model and its eigenfunctions;In a recent work, we have initiated the theory of N=2 symmetric superpolynomials. As far as the classical bases are concerned, this is a rather straightforward generalization of the N=1 case. However this construction could not be generalized to the formulation of Jack superpolynomials. The origin of this obstruction is unraveled here, opening the path for building the desired Jack extension. Those are shown to be obtained from the non-symmetric Jack polynomials by a suitable symmetrization procedure and an appropriate dressing by the anticommuting variables. This construction is substantiated by the characterization of the N=2 Jack superpolynomials as the eigenfunctions of the N=2 supersymmetric version of the Calogero-Sutherland model, for which, as a side result, we demonstrate the complete integrability by displaying the explicit form of four towers of mutually commuting (bosonic) conserved quantities. The N=2 Jack superpolynomials are orthogonal with respect to the analytical scalar product (induced by the quantum-mechanical formulation) as well as a new combinatorial scalar product defined on a suitable deformation of the power-sum basis.;math-ph
1801.02423;Enumeration and randomized constructions of hypertrees;Over thirty years ago, Kalai proved a beautiful $d$-dimensional analog of Cayley's formula for the number of $n$-vertex trees. He enumerated $d$-dimensional hypertrees weighted by the squared size of their $(d-1)$-dimensional homology group. This, however, does not answer the more basic problem of unweighted enumeration of $d$-hypertrees, which is our concern here. Our main result, Theorem 1.4, significantly improves the lower bound for the number of $d$-hypertrees. In addition, we study a random $1$-out model of $d$-complexes where every $(d-1)$-dimensional face selects a random $d$-face containing it, and show it has a negligible $d$-dimensional homology.;math.CO
1801.02425;Symmetric solutions for a partial differential elliptic equation that arises in stochastic production planning with production constraints;In this article we consider the question of the existence of positive symmetric solutions to the problems of the following type $\Delta u=a\left( \left\vert x\right\vert \right) h\left( u\right) +b\left( \left\vert x\right\vert \right) g\left( u\right) $ for $x\in \mathbb{R}^{N}$, which are called entire large solutions. Here $N\geq 3$, and we assume that $a$ and $b$ are nonnegative continuous spherically symmetric functions on $\mathbb{R}% ^{N} $. We extend results previously obtained for special cases of $h$ and $% g $ and we will describe a real-world model in which such problems may arise.;math.OC
1801.02428;Quadratic Transformations of Hypergeometric Function and Series with Harmonic Numbers;In this brief note, we show how to apply Kummer's and other quadratic transformation formulas for Gauss' and generalized hypergeometric functions in order to obtain transformation and summation formulas for series with harmonic numbers that contain one or two continuous parameters. We also give a generating function of the sequence $\frac{(a)_n (1-a)_n}{(n!)^2}H_n$ as a combination of Gauss hypergeometric function and elementary functions.;math.CA
1801.02431;Hessian of the Ricci Calabi functional;The Ricci Calabi functional is a functional on the space of K\"ahler metrics of Fano manifolds. Its critical points are called generalized K\"ahler Einstein metrics. In this article, we show that the Hessian of the Ricci Calabi functional is non-negative at generalized K\"ahler Einstein metrics. As its application, we give another proof of a Matsushima's type decomposition theorem for holomorphic vector fields, which was originally proved by Mabuchi. We also discuss a relation to the inverse Monge-Amp\`ere flow developed recently by Collins-Hisamoto-Takahashi.;math.DG
1801.02432;On Absolutely Norm attaining Operators;We give necessary and sufficient conditions for a bounded operator defined between complex Hilbert spaces to be absolutely norm attaining.

1801.02442;Precoding via Approximate Message Passing with Instantaneous Signal Constraints;This paper proposes a low complexity precoding algorithm based on the recently proposed Generalized Least Square Error (GLSE) scheme with generic penalty and support. The algorithm iteratively constructs the transmit vector via Approximate Message Passing (AMP). Using the asymptotic decoupling property of GLSE precoders, we derive closed form fixed point equations to tune the parameters in the proposed algorithm for a general set of instantaneous signal constraints. The tuning strategy is then utilized to construct transmit vectors with restricted peak-to-average power ratios and to efficiently select a subset of transmit antennas. The numerical investigations show that the proposed algorithm tracks the large-system performance of GLSE precoders even for a moderate number of antennas.;cs.IT
1801.02446;Convergence in variation of solutions of nonlinear Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations to stationary measures;We study convergence in variation of probability solutions of nonlinear Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations to stationary solutions. We obtain sufficient conditions for the exponential convergence of solutions to the stationary solution in case of coefficients that can have an arbitrary growth at infinity and depend on the solutions through convolutions with unbounded discontinuous kernels. In addition, we study a more difficult case where the nonlinear equation has several stationary solutions and convergence to a stationary solution depends on initial data. Finally, we obtain sufficient conditions for solvability of nonlinear Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations.;math.PR
1801.02456;Coprime Subdegrees of Twisted Wreath Permutation Groups;Dolfi, Guralnick, Praeger and Spiga asked if there exist infinitely many primitive groups of twisted wreath type with nontrivial coprime subdegrees. Here we settle this question in the affirmative. We construct infinite families of primitive twisted wreath permutation groups with nontrivial coprime subdegrees. In particular, we define a primitive twisted wreath group $G(m,q)$ constructed from the nonabelian simple group $\text{PSL}(2,q)$ and a primitive permutation group of diagonal type with socle $\text{PSL}(2,q)^m$, and determine all values of $m$ and $q$ for which $G(m,q)$ has nontrivial coprime subdegrees. In the case where $m=2$ and $q\notin\{7,11,29\}$ we obtain a full classification of all pairs of nontrivial coprime subdegrees.;math.GR
1801.02465;Extremes of vector-valued Gaussian processes with Trend;Let $X(t)=(X_1(t), \dots, X_n(t)), t\in \mathcal{T}\subset \mathbb{R} $ be a centered vector-valued Gaussian process with independent components and continuous trajectories, and $h(t)=(h_1(t),\dots, h_n(t)), t\in \mathcal{T} $ be a vector-valued continuous function. We investigate the asymptotics of $$\mathbb{P}\left(\sup_{t\in \mathcal{T} } \min_{1\leq i\leq n}(X_i(t)+h_i(t))&gt,u\right)$$ as $u\to\infty$. As an illustration to the derived results we analyze two important classes of $X(t)$: with locally-stationary structure and with varying variances of the coordinates, and calculate exact asymptotics of simultaneous ruin probability and ruin time in a Gaussian risk model.;math.PR
1801.02467;Fixed Points of anti-attracting maps and Eigenforms on Fractals;An important problem in analysis on fractals is the existence of a self-similar energy on finitely ramified fractals. The self-similar energies are constructed in terms of eigenforms, that is, eigenvectors of a special nonlinear operator. Previous results by C. Sabot and V. Metz give conditions for the existence of an eigenform. In this paper, I give a different and probably shorter proof of the previous results, which appears to be suitable for improvements. Such a proof is based on a fixed-point theorem for anti-attracting maps on a convex set.;math.FA
1801.02469;The time of ultimate recovery in Gaussian risk model;We analyze the distance $\mathcal{R}_T(u)$ between the first and the last passage time of $\{X(t)-ct:t\in [0,T]\}$ at level $u$ in time horizon $T\in(0,\infty]$, where $X$ is a centered Gaussian process with stationary increments and $c\in\mathbb{R}$, given that the first passage time occurred before $T$. Under some tractable assumptions on $X$, we find $\Delta(u)$ and $G(x)$ such that $$\lim_{u\to\infty}\mathbb{P}\left(\mathcal{R}_T(u)&gt,\Delta(u)x\right)=G(x),$$ for $x\geq 0$. We distinguish two scenarios: $T&lt,\infty$ and $T=\infty$, that lead to qualitatively different asymptotics. The obtained results provide exact asymptotics of the ultimate recovery time after the ruin in Gaussian risk model.;math.PR
1801.02473;A survey on Tingley&#x27,s problem for operator algebras;We survey the most recent results on extension of isometries between special subsets of the unit spheres of C$^*$-algebras, von Neumann algebras, trace class operators, preduals of von Neumann algebras, and $p$-Schatten-von Neumann spaces, with special interest on Tingley's problem.;math.OA
1801.02479;Hyperbolicity notions for varieties defined over a non-Archimedean field;Firstly, we pursue the work of W. Cherry on the analogue of the Kobayashi semi distance dCK that he introduced for analytic spaces defined over a non-Archimedean metrized field k. We prove various characterizations of smooth projective varieties for which dCK is an actual distance. Secondly, we explore several notions of hyperbolicity for a smooth algebraic curve X defined over k. We prove a non-Archimedean analogue of the equivalence between having negative Euler characteristic and the normality of certain families of analytic maps taking values in X.;math.AG
1801.02481;Combinatorial Proofs of Two Overpartition Theorems Connected by a Universal Mock Theta Function;In 2015, Bringmann, Lovejoy and Mahlburg considered certain kinds overpartitions, which can been seen as the overpartition analogue of Schur's partition. The motivation of their work is that the difference between the generating function of Schur's classical partitions and the generating functions of the partitions in which the smallest part is excluded. The difference between the two generating functions of partitions is a specialization of the "universal" mock theta function g_3 which introduced by Hickerson. To give an analogue of this, by using another universal mock theta function g_2 instead of g_3, Bringmann Lovejoy and Mahlburg introduced two kinds of overpartitions, which satisfy certain congruence conditions and difference conditions with the smallest parts different. They prove these theorems by using the q-differential equations. In this paper, we will give the generating functions of these two kinds of overpartitions by combinatorial technique.;math.CO
1801.02486;Tail Asymptotic Behavior of the supremum of a class of chi-square processes;In this paper, we analyze a multivariate counterpart of the generalized weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, which is the supremum of weighted locally stationary chi-square process over non-compact interval. The boundedness and the exact tail asymptotic behavior of the statistics are derived. <br />We illustrate our findings by two examples where the statistic is defined by Brownian bridge and fractional Brownian motion respectively.;math.PR
1801.02487;A Poincar&#x27,e-Hopf Type Formula for A Pair of Vector Fields;We extend the reslut about Poincar\'e-Hopf type formula for the difference of the Chern character numbers (cf.[3]) to the non-isolated singularities, and establish a Poincar\'e-Hopf type formula for a pair of vector field with the function $h^{T_{\mathbb{C}}M}(\cdot,\cdot)$ has non-isolated zero points over a closed, oriented smooth manifold of dimension $2n$.;math.DG
1801.02491;On Carlson&#x27,s Depth Conjecture;J.F. Carlson conjectured in 1995 that if G is a finite group and k is a field whose characteristic p divides the order of G that the depth of H*(G,k) equals the minimum of the dimensions of associated primes of H*(G,k). This is obviously true if H*(G,k) is Cohen-Macaulay and definitely false for arbitrary finitely generated k-algebras. It was shown by Carlson to be true if the dimension of H*(G,k) equals 2 and by D.J. Green to be true if the depth of H*(G,k) is equal to its possible minimum value, namely the maximum of the dimensions of elementary abelian p-groups contained in the center of G. In this paper we show the conjecture is true if dimension(H*(G,k))-depth(H*(G,k))=1. Known examples show the conjecture to be false for arbitrary finitely generated k-algebras satisfying this condition.;math.AC
1801.02493;Further results on the structure of (co)ends in finite tensor categories;Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a finite tensor category, and let $\mathcal{M}$ be an exact left $\mathcal{C}$-module category. The action of $\mathcal{C}$ on $\mathcal{M}$ induces a functor $\rho: \mathcal{C} \to \mathrm{Rex}(\mathcal{M})$, where $\mathrm{Rex}(\mathcal{M})$ is the category of $k$-linear right exact endofunctors on $\mathcal{M}$. Our key observation is that $\rho$ has a right adjoint $\rho^{\mathrm{ra}}$ given by the end $\rho^{\mathrm{ra}}(F) = \int_{M \in \mathcal{M}} \underline{\mathrm{Hom}}(M, M)$. As an application, we establish the following results: (1) We give a description of the composition of the induction functor $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{M}}^* \to \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{M}}^*)$ and Schauenburg's equivalence $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{M}}^*) \approx \mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})$. (2) We introduce the space $\mathrm{CF}(\mathcal{M})$ of `class functions' of $\mathcal{M}$ and initiate the character theory for pivotal module categories. (3) We introduce a filtration for $\mathrm{CF}(\mathcal{M})$ and discuss its relation with some ring-theoretic notions, such as the Reynolds ideal and its generalizations. (4) We show that $\mathrm{Ext}_{\mathcal{C}}^{\bullet}(1, \rho^{\mathrm{ra}}(\mathrm{id}_{\mathcal{M}}))$ is isomorphic to the Hochschild cohomology of $\mathcal{M}$. As an application, we show that the modular group acts projectively on the Hochschild cohomology of a modular tensor category.;math.QA
1801.02494;On the Cauchy problem with large data for the space-dependent Boltzmann Nordheim equation III;This paper studies the quantum Boltzmann Nordheim equation from a Boltzmann equation for Haldane statistics. Strong solutions are obtained for the Cauchy problem with initial data in L1 and uniformly bounded on a one (resp. two or three)-dimensional torus for three-dimensional velocities and pseudo-Maxwellian (resp. very soft) forces. The main results are existence, uniqueness and stability of solutions conserving mass, momentum, and energy, with the uniform bound exploding if the solutions are only local in time.;math-ph
1801.02496;Cumulant Generating Function of Codeword Lengths in Variable-Length Lossy Compression Allowing Positive Excess Distortion Probability;This paper considers the problem of variable-length lossy source coding. The performance criteria are the excess distortion probability and the cumulant generating function of codeword lengths. We derive a non-asymptotic fundamental limit of the cumulant generating function of codeword lengths allowing positive excess distortion probability. It is shown that the achievability and converse bounds are characterized by the R\'enyi entropy-based quantity. In the proof of the achievability result, the explicit code construction is provided. Further, we investigate an asymptotic single-letter characterization of the fundamental limit for a stationary memoryless source.;cs.IT
1801.02497;Closures of locally divergent orbits of maximal tori and values of homogeneous forms;Let $\G$ be a semisimple algebraic group over a number field $K$, $\mathcal{S}$ a finite set of places of $K$, $K_\mathcal{S}$ the direct product of the completions $K_v, v \in \mathcal{S}$, and $\OO$ the ring of $\mathcal{S}$-integers of $K$. Let $G = \G(K_\mathcal{S})$, $\Gamma = \G(\OO)$ and $\pi:G \rightarrow G/\Gamma$ the quotient map. We describe the closures of the locally divergent orbits ${T\pi(g)}$ %in $G/\Gamma$ where $T$ is a maximal $K_\mathcal{S}$-split torus in $G$. If $\# S = 2$ then the closure $\overline{T\pi(g)}$ is a finite union of $T$-orbits stratified in terms of parabolic subgroups of $\G \times \G$ and, consequently, $\overline{T\pi(g)}$ is homogeneous (i.e., $\overline{T\pi(g)}= H\pi(g)$ for a subgroup $H$ of $G$) if and only if ${T\pi(g)}$ is closed. On the other hand, if $\# \mathcal{S} &gt, 2$ and $K$ is not a $\mathrm{CM}$-field then $\overline{T\pi(g)}$ is homogeneous for $\G = \mathbf{SL}_{n}$ and, generally, non-homogeneous but squeezed between closed orbits of two reductive subgroups of equal semisimple $K$-ranks for $\G \neq \mathbf{SL}_{n}$. As an application, we prove that $\overline{f(\OO^{n})} = K_{\mathcal{S}}$ for the class of non-rational locally $K$-decomposable homogeneous forms $f \in K_{\mathcal{S}}[x_1, \cdots, x_{n}]$.;math.DS
1801.02502;Optimal distributed control of two-dimensional nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes systems with degenerate mobility and singular potential;In this paper, we consider a two-dimensional diffuse interface model for the phase separation of an incompressible and isothermal binary fluid mixture with matched densities. This model consists of the Navier--Stokes equations, nonlinearly coupled with a convective nonlocal Cahn--Hilliard equation. The system rules the evolution of the volume-averaged velocity $\uvec$ of the mixture and the (relative) concentration difference $\varphi$ of the two phases. The aim of this work is to study an optimal control problem for such a system, the control being a time-dependent external force acting on the fluid. We first prove the existence of an optimal control for a given tracking type cost functional. Then we study the differentiability properties of the control-to-state map $\vvec \mapsto [\uvec,\varphi]$, and we establish first-order necessary optimality conditions. These results generalize the ones obtained by the first and the third authors jointly with E.~Rocca in [19]. There the authors assumed a constant mobility and a regular potential with polynomially controlled growth. Here, we analyze the physically more relevant case of a degenerate mobility and a singular (e.g., logarithmic) potential. This is made possible by the existence of a unique strong solution which was recently proved by the authors and C.\,G.~Gal in [14].;math.AP
1801.02504;On the consistency of adaptive multiple tests;Much effort has been done to control the "false discovery rate" (FDR) when $m$ hypotheses are tested simultaneously. The FDR is the expectation of the "false discovery proportion" $\text{FDP}=V/R$ given by the ratio of the number of false rejections $V$ and all rejections $R$. In this paper, we have a closer look at the FDP for adaptive linear step-up multiple tests. These tests extend the well known Benjamini and Hochberg test by estimating the unknown amount $m_0$ of the true null hypotheses. We give exact finite sample formulas for higher moments of the FDP and, in particular, for its variance. Using these allows us a precise discussion about the consistency of adaptive step-up tests. We present sufficient and necessary conditions for consistency on the estimators $\widehat m_0$ and the underlying probability regime. We apply our results to convex combinations of generalized Storey type estimators with various tuning parameters and (possibly) data-driven weights. The corresponding step-up tests allow a flexible adaptation. Moreover, these tests control the FDR at finite sample size. We compare these tests to the classical Benjamini and Hochberg test and discuss the advantages of it.;math.ST
1801.02505;Optimal Utility-Privacy Trade-off with Total Variation Distance as a Privacy Measure;The total variation distance is proposed as a privacy measure in an information disclosure scenario when the goal is to reveal some information about available data in return of utility, while retaining the privacy of certain sensitive latent variables from the legitimate receiver. The total variation distance is introduced as a measure of privacy-leakage by showing that: i) it satisfies the post-processing and linkage inequalities, which makes it consistent with an intuitive notion of a privacy measure, ii) the optimal utility-privacy trade-off can be solved through a standard linear program when total variation distance is employed as the privacy measure, iii) it provides a bound on the privacy-leakage measured by mutual information, maximal leakage, or the improvement in an inference attack with a bounded cost function.;cs.IT

Based on the representation of S-parameters when an anomaly exists, we design a direct sampling method (DSM) for imaging an anomaly and establishing a relationship between the indicator function of DSM and an infinite series of Bessel functions of integer order. Simulation results using synthetic data at f=1GHz of angular frequency are illustrated to support the identified structure of the indicator function.;math.NA
1801.02513;Genus zero Gopakumar-Vafa type invariants for Calabi-Yau 4-folds;In analogy with the Gopakumar-Vafa conjecture on CY 3-folds, Klemm and Pandharipande defined GV type invariants on Calabi-Yau 4-folds using Gromov-Witten theory and conjectured their integrality. In this paper, we propose a sheaf-theoretic interpretation of their genus zero invariants using Donaldson-Thomas theory on CY 4-folds. More specifically, we conjecture genus zero GV type invariants are $\mathrm{DT_{4}}$ invariants for one-dimensional stable sheaves on CY 4-folds. Some examples are computed for both compact and non-compact CY 4-folds to support our conjectures. We also propose an equivariant version of the conjectures for local curves and verify them in certain cases.;math.AG
1801.02515;Data-driven semi-parametric detection of multiple changes in long-range dependent processes;This paper is devoted to the offline multiple changes detection for long-range dependence processes. The observations are supposed to satisfy a semi-parametric long-range dependence assumption with distinct memory parameters on each stage. A penalized local Whittle contrast is considered for estimating all the parameters, notably the number of changes. The consistency as well as convergence rates are obtained. Monte-Carlo experiments exhibit the accuracy of the estimators. They also show that the estimation of the number of breaks is improved by using a data-driven slope heuristic procedure of choice of the penalization parameter.;math.ST
1801.02516;Detection of small inhomogeneities via direct sampling method in transverse electric polarization;Various studies have confirmed the possibility of identifying the location of a set of small inhomogeneities via a direct sampling method, however, when their permeability differs from that of the background, their location cannot be satisfactorily identified. However, no theoretical explanation for this phenomenon has been verified. In this study, we demonstrate that the indicator function of the direct sampling method can be expressed by the Bessel function of order one of the first kind and explain why the exact locations of inhomogeneities cannot be identified. Numerical results with noisy data are exhibited to support our examination.;math.NA
1801.02517;On the cofinality of the splitting number;The splitting number can be singular.

Math., 65, (1989);math.LO
1801.02519;Fano Kaleidoscopes and their generalizations;In this work we introduce Fano Kaleidoscopes, Hesse Kaleidoscopes and their generalizations. These are a particular kind of colored designs for which we will discuss general theory, present some constructions and prove existence results. In particular, using difference methods we show the existence of both a Fano and a Hesse Kaleidoscope on $v$ points when $v$ is a prime or prime power congruent to 1$\pmod{6}$, $v\ne13$. In the Fano case this, together with known results on pairwise balanced designs, allows us to prove the existence of Kaleidoscopes of order $v$ for many other values of $v$, we discuss what the situation is, on the other hand, in the Hesse and general case.;math.CO
1801.02520;On the Szeg&#x151, formulas for truncated Wiener-Hopf operators;We consider functions of multi-dimensional versions of truncated Wiener--Hopf operators with smooth symbols, and study the scaling asymptotics of their traces. The obtained results extend the asymptotic formulas obtained by H. Widom in the 1980's to non-smooth functions, and non-smooth truncation domains. The obtained asymptotic formulas are used to analyse the scaling limit of the spatially bipartite entanglement entropy of thermal equilibrium states of non-interacting fermions at positive temperature.;math.SP
1801.02521;Cohomological Property of Vector Bundles on Biprojective Spaces;This paper investigates the cohomological property of vector bundles on biprojective space.

1801.02523;Asymmetric tie-points and almost clopen subsets of N*;A tie-point of a compact space is analogous to a cut-point: the complement of the point falls apart into two relatively clopen non-compact subsets. Set-theoretically a tie-point of N* is an ultrafilter whose dual maximal ideal can be generated by the union of two non-principal mod finite orthogonal ideals. We review some of the many consistency results that have depended on the construction of tie-points of N*. One especially important application, due to Velickovic, was to the existence of non-trivial involutions on N*. A tie-point of N* has been called symmetric if it is the unique fixed point of an involution. We define the notion of an almost clopen set to be the closure of one of the proper relatively clopen subsets of the complement of a tie-point. We explore asymmetries of almost clopen subsets of N* in the sense of how may an almost clopen set differ from its natural complementary almost clopen set.;math.GN
1801.02525;Refined Tail Asymptotic Properties for the $M^X/G/1$ Retrial Queue;In the literature, retrial queues with batch arrivals and heavy service times have been studied and the so-called equivalence theorem has been established under the condition that the service time is heavier than the batch size. The equivalence theorem provides the distribution (or tail) equivalence between the total number of customers in the system for the retrial queue and the total number of customers in the corresponding standard (non-retrial) queue. In this paper, under the assumption of regularly varying tails, we eliminate this condition by allowing that the service time can be either heavier or lighter than the batch size. The main contribution made in this paper is an asymptotic characterization of the difference between two tail probabilities: the probability of the total number of customers in the system for the $M^X/G/1$ retrial queue and the probability of the total number of customers in the corresponding standard (non-retrial) queue. The equivalence theorem by allowing a heavier batch size is another contribution in this paper.;math.PR
1801.02526;Probing non-orthogonality of eigenvectors in non-Hermitian matrix models: diagrammatic approach;Using large $N$ arguments, we propose a scheme for calculating the two-point eigenvector correlation function for non-normal random matrices in the large $N$ limit. The setting generalizes the quaternionic extension of free probability to two-point functions. In the particular case of biunitarily invariant random matrices, we obtain a simple, general expression for the two-point eigenvector correlation function, which can be viewed as a further generalization of the single ring theorem. This construction has some striking similarities to the freeness of the second kind known for the Hermitian ensembles in large $N$. On the basis of several solved examples, we conjecture two kinds of microscopic universality of the eigenvectors - one in the bulk, and one at the rim. The form of the conjectured bulk universality agrees with the scaling limit found by Chalker and Mehlig [JT Chalker, B Mehlig, PRL, \textbf{81}, 3367 (1998)] in the case of the complex Ginibre ensemble.;math-ph
1801.02528;Positive solutions for a second order multi-point boundary value problem with delay;In this work, we investigate the existence of positive solutions for a multi-point boundary value problem for a second order delay differential equation. Under certain growth conditions on the nonlinearity, and by the mean of Leray-Schauder fixed point theorem, sufficient conditions for the existence of nontrivial solution are obtained, which improve the results of J. Chen et al. [3].;math.AP
1801.02529;Finitary coding for the sub-critical Ising model with finite expected coding volume;It has been shown by van den Berg and Steif that the sub-critical Ising model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is a finitary factor of a finite-valued i.i.d. process. We strengthen this by showing that the factor map can be made to have finite expected coding volume (in fact, stretched-exponential tails), answering a question of van den Berg and Steif. The result holds at any temperature above the critical temperature. An analogous result holds for Markov random fields satisfying a high-noise assumption and for proper colorings with a large number of colors.;math.PR
1801.02530;The local limit theorem on nilpotent Lie groups;A local limit theorem is proven on connected, simply connected nilpotent Lie groups, for a class of generating measures satisfying a moment condition and a condition on the characteristic function of the abelianization. The result extends an earlier local limit theorems of Alexopoulos which treated absolutely continuous measures with a continuous density of compact support, and also extends local limit theorems of Breuillard and Diaconis-Hough which treated general measures on the Heisenberg group.;math.PR
1801.02532;On the Discrepancy Between Two Zagreb Indices;We examine the quantity \[S(G) = \sum_{uv\in E(G)} \min(\text{deg } u, \text{deg } v)\] over sets of graphs with a fixed number of edges. The main result shows the maximum possible value of $S(G)$ is achieved by three different classes of constructions, depending on the distance between the number of edges and the nearest triangular number. Furthermore we determine the maximum possible value when the set of graphs is restricted to be bipartite, a forest or to be planar given sufficiently many edges. The quantity $S(G)$ corresponds to the difference between two well studied indices, the irregularity of a graph and the sum of the squares of the degrees in a graph. These are known as the first and third Zagreb indices in the area of mathematical chemistry.;math.CO
1801.02538;Equivalence of the Rothberger and $2$-Rothberger Games for Hausdorff Spaces;We prove that in any Hausdorff space, the Rothberger game is equivalent to the $k$-Rothberger game, i.e. the game in which player II chooses $k$ open sets in each move. This result follows from a more general theorem in which we show these games are equivalent to a game we call the restricted Menger game. In this game I knows immediately in advance of playing each open cover how many open sets II will choose from that open cover. This result illuminates the relationship between the Rothberger and Menger games in Hausdorff spaces. The equivalence of these games answers a question posed by Aurichi, Bella, and Dias, at least in the context of Hausdorff spaces.;math.GN
1801.02539;Bayesian estimation of a decreasing density;Suppose $X_1,\dots, X_n$ is a random sample from a bounded and decreasing density $f_0$ on $[0,\infty)$. We are interested in estimating such $f_0$, with special interest in $f_0(0)$. This problem is encountered in various statistical applications and has gained quite some attention in the statistical literature. It is well known that the maximum likelihood estimator is inconsistent at zero. This has led several authors to propose alternative estimators which are consistent. As any decreasing density can be represented as a scale mixture of uniform densities, a Bayesian estimator is obtained by endowing the mixture distribution with the Dirichlet process prior. Assuming this prior, we derive contraction rates of the posterior density at zero by carefully revising arguments presented in Salomond (2014). Various methods for estimating the density are compared using a simulation study. We apply the Bayesian procedure to the current durations data described in Keiding et al.(2012).;math.ST
1801.02545;Quasiregular semigroups with examples;Rational semigroups were introduced by Hinkkanen and Martin as a generalization of the iteration of a single rational map. There has subsequently been much interest in the study of rational semigroups. Quasiregular semigroups were introduced shortly after rational semigroups as analogues in higher real dimensions, but have received far less attention. Each map in a quasiregular semigroup must necessarily be a uniformly quasiregular map. While there is a completely viable theory for the iteration of uniformly quasiregular maps, it is a highly non-trivial matter to construct them. In this paper, we study properties of the Julia and Fatou sets of quasiregular semigroups and, equally as importantly, give several families of examples illustrating some of the behaviours that can arise.;math.DS
1801.02553;Gaussian 1-2-1 Networks: Capacity Results for mmWave Communications;This paper proposes a new model for wireless relay networks referred to as "1-2-1 network", where two nodes can communicate only if they point "beams" at each other, while if they do not point beams at each other, no signal can be exchanged or interference can be generated. This model is motivated by millimeter wave communications where, due to the high path loss, a link between two nodes can exist only if beamforming gain at both sides is established, while in the absence of beamforming gain the signal is received well below the thermal noise floor. The main result in this paper is that the 1-2-1 network capacity can be approximated by routing information along at most $2N+2$ paths, where $N$ is the number of relays connecting a source and a destination through an arbitrary topology.;cs.IT
1801.02561;Flux reconstructions in the Lehmann-Goerisch method for lower bounds on eigenvalues;The standard application of the Lehmann-Goerisch method for lower bounds on eigenvalues of symmetric elliptic second-order partial differential operators relies on determination of fluxes $\sigma_i$ that approximate co-gradients of exact eigenfunctions scaled by corresponding eigenvalues. Fluxes $\sigma_i$ are usually computed by a global saddle point problem solved by mixed finite element methods. In this paper we propose a simpler global problem that yields fluxes $\sigma_i$ of the same quality. The simplified problem is smaller, it is positive definite, and any $H(\mathrm{div},\Omega)$ conforming finite elements, such as Raviart-Thomas elements, can be used for its solution. In addition, these global problems can be split into a number of independent local problems on patches, which allows for trivial parallelization. The computational performance of these approaches is illustrated by numerical examples for Laplace and Steklov type eigenvalue problems. These examples also show that local flux reconstructions enable to compute lower bounds on eigenvalues on considerably finer meshes than the traditional global reconstructions.;math.NA
1801.02562;Vanishing theorems for parabolic Higgs bundles;This is a sequel to "Kodaira-Saito vanishing via Higgs bundles in positive characteristic" (<a href="/abs/1611.09880">arXiv:1611.09880</a>). However, unlike the previous paper, all the arguments here are in characteristic zero. The main result is a Kodaira vanishing theorem for semistable parabolic Higgs bundles with trivial parabolic Chern classes. This implies a general semipositivity theorem. This also implies a Kodaira-Saito vanishing theorem for complex variations of Hodge structure.;math.AG
1801.02563;Information Theoretic Security for Side-Channel Attacks to the Shannon Cipher System;We study side-channel attacks for the Shannon cipher system. To pose side channel-attacks to the Shannon cipher system, we regard them as a signal estimation via encoded data from two distributed sensors. This can be formulated as the one helper source coding problem posed and investigated by Ahlswede, K\"orner(1975), and Wyner(1975). We further investigate the posed problem to derive new secrecy bounds. Our results are derived by a coupling of the result Watanabe and Oohama(2012) obtained on bounded storage evasdropper with the exponential strong converse theorem Oohama(2015) established for the one helper source coding problem.;cs.IT
1801.02564;Sampling Almost Periodic and related Functions;We consider certain finite sets of circle-valued functions defined on intervals of real numbers and estimate how large the intervals must be for the values of these functions to be uniformly distributed in an approximate way. <br />This is used to establish some general conditions under which a random construction introduced by Katznelson for the integers yields sets that are dense in the Bohr group. We obtain in this way very sparse sets of real numbers (and of integers) on which two different almost periodic functions cannot agree, what makes them amenable to be used in sampling theorems for these functions. These sets can be made as sparse as to have zero asymptotic density or as to be t-sets, i.e., to be sets that intersect any of their translates in a bounded set. Many of these results are proved not only for almost periodic functions but also for classes of functions generated by more general complex exponential functions, including chirps.;math.FA
1801.02566;Equivalences between learning of data and probability distributions, and their applications;Algorithmic learning theory traditionally studies the learnability of effective infinite binary sequences (reals), while recent work by [Vitanyi and Chater, 2017] and [Bienvenu et al., 2014] has adapted this framework to the study of learnability of effective probability distributions from random data. We prove that for certain families of probability measures that are parametrized by reals, learnability of a subclass of probability measures is equivalent to learnability of the class of the corresponding real parameters. This equivalence allows to transfer results from classical algorithmic theory to learning theory of probability measures. We present a number of such applications, providing many new results regarding EX and BC learnability of classes of measures, thus drawing parallels between the two learning theories.;math.LO
1801.02572;Gaps in the spectrum of a cuboidal periodic lattice graph;We locate gaps in the spectrum of a Hamiltonian on a periodic cuboidal (and generally hyperrectangular) lattice graph with $\delta$ couplings in the vertices. We formulate sufficient conditions under which the number of gaps is finite. As the main result, we find a connection between the arrangement of the gaps and the coefficients in a continued fraction associated with the ratio of edge lengths of the lattice. This knowledge enables a straightforward construction of a periodic quantum graph with any required number of spectral gaps and---to some degree---to control their positions, i.e., to partially solve the inverse spectral problem.;math-ph

1801.02585;Khovanov homology and binary dihedral representations for marked links;We introduce a version of Khovanov homology for alternating links with marking data, $\omega$, inspired by instanton theory. We show that the analogue of the spectral sequence from Khovanov homology to singular instanton homology introduced in \cite{KM_unknot} for this marked Khovanov homology collapses on the $E_2$ page for alternating links. We moreover show that for non-split links the Khovanov homology we introduce for alternating links does not depend on $\omega$, thus, the instanton homology also does not depend on $\omega$ for non-split alternating links. <br />Finally, we study a version of binary dihedral representations for links with markings, and show that for links of non-zero determinant, this also does not depend on $\omega$.;math.GT
1801.02587;Quenched phantom distribution functions for Markov chains;It is known that random walk Metropolis algorithms with heavy-tailed target densities can model atypical (slow) growth of maxima, which in general is exhibited by processes with the extremal index zero. The asymptotics of maxima of such sequences can be analyzed in terms of continuous phantom distribution functions. We show that in a large class of positive Harris recurrent Markov chains (containing the above Metropolis chains) a phantom distribution function can be recovered by starting "at the point" rather than from the stationary distribution.;math.PR
1801.02590;Number and Stability of Relaxation Oscillations for Predator-Prey Systems with Small Death Rates;We consider planar systems of predator-prey models with small predator death rate $\epsilon&gt,0$. Using geometric singular perturbation theory and Floquet theory, we derive characteristic functions that determines the location and the stability of relaxation oscillations as $\epsilon\to 0$. When the prey-isocline has a single interior local extremum, we prove that the system has a unique nontrivial periodic orbit, which forms a relaxation oscillation. For some systems with prey-isocline possessing two interior local extrema, we show that either the positive equilibrium is globally stable, or the system has exact two periodic orbits. In particular, for a predator-prey model with the Holling type IV functional response we derive a threshold value of the carrying capacity that separates these two outcomes. This result supports the so-called paradox of enrichment.;math.CA
1801.02594;Utility Optimal Scheduling for Coded Caching in General Topologies;We consider coded caching over the fading broadcast channel, where the users, equipped with a memory of finite size, experience asymmetric fading statistics. It is known that a naive application of coded caching over the channel at hand performs poorly especially in the regime of a large number of users due to a vanishing multicast rate. We overcome this detrimental effect by a careful design of opportunistic scheduling policies such that some utility function of the long-term average rates should be maximized while balancing fairness among users. In particular, we propose a threshold-based scheduling that requires only statistical channel state information and one-bit feedback from each user. More specifically, each user indicates via feedback whenever its SNR is above a threshold determined solely by the fading statistics and the fairness requirement. Surprisingly, we prove that this simple scheme achieves the optimal utility in the regime of a large number of users. Numerical examples show that our proposed scheme performs closely to the scheduling with full channel state information, but at a significantly reduced complexity.;cs.IT

The third puzzle is: are quantum computers possible?;math.CO
1801.02611;Spin Conductance and Spin Conductivity in Topological Insulators: Analysis of Kubo-like terms;We investigate spin transport in 2-dimensional insulators, with the long-term goal of establishing whether any of the transport coefficients corresponds to the Fu-Kane-Mele index which characterizes 2d time-reversal-symmetric topological insulators. Inspired by the Kubo theory of charge transport, and by using a proper definition of the spin current operator, we define the Kubo-like spin conductance $G_K^{s_z}$ and spin conductivity $\sigma_K^{s_z}$. We prove that for any gapped, periodic, near-sighted discrete Hamiltonian, the above quantities are mathematically well-defined and the equality $G_K^{s_z} = \sigma_K^{s_z}$ holds true. Moreover, we argue that the physically relevant condition to obtain the equality above is the vanishing of the mesoscopic average of the spin-torque response, which holds true under our hypotheses on the Hamiltonian operator. This vanishing condition might be relevant in view of further extensions of the result, e.g. to ergodic random discrete Hamiltonians or to Schr\"odinger operators on the continuum. A central role in the proof is played by the trace per unit volume and by two generalizations of the trace, the principal value trace and it directional version.;math-ph
1801.02644;On monomial ideals and their socles;For a finite subset $M\subset [x_1,\ldots,x_d]$ of monomials, we describe how to constructively obtain a monomial ideal $I\subseteq R = K[x_1,\ldots,x_d]$ such that the set of monomials in $\text{Soc}(I)\setminus I$ is precisely $M$, or such that $\overline{M}\subseteq R/I$ is a $K$-basis for the the socle of $R/I$. For a given $M$ we obtain a natural class of monomials $I$ with this property. This is done by using solely the lattice structure of the monoid $[x_1,\ldots,x_d]$. We then present some duality results by using anti-isomorphisms between upsets and downsets of $(\mathbb Z^d,\preceq)$. Finally, we define and analyze zero-dimensional monomial ideals of $R$ of type $k$, where type $1$ are exactly the Artinian Gorenstein ideals, and describe the structure of such ideals that correspond to order-generic antichains in $\mathbb Z^d$.;math.AC
1801.02646;Exploiting random lead times for significant inventory cost savings;We study the classical single-item inventory system in which unsatisfied demands are backlogged. Replenishment lead times are random, independent identically distributed, causing orders to cross in time. We develop a new inventory policy to exploit implications of lead time randomness and order crossover, and evaluate its performance by asymptotic analysis and simulations. Our policy does not follow the basic principle of Constant Base Stock (CBS) policy, or more generally, (s,S) and (r,Q) policies, which is to keep the inventory position within a fixed range. Instead, it uses the current inventory level (= inventory-on-hand minus backlog) to set a dynamic target for inventory in-transit, and place orders to follow this target. Our policy includes CBS policy as a special case, under a particular choice of a policy parameter. We show that our policy can significantly reduce the average inventory cost compared with CBS policy. Specifically, we prove that if the lead time is exponentially distributed, then under our policy, with properly chosen policy parameters, the expected (absolute) inventory level scales as $o(\sqrt{r})$, as the demand rate $r\to\infty$. In comparison, it is known to scale as $\Theta(\sqrt{r})$ under CBS policy. In particular, this means that, as $r\to\infty$, the average inventory cost under our policy vanishes in comparison with that under CBS policy. Furthermore, our simulations show that the advantage of our policy remains to be substantial under non-exponential lead time distributions, and may even be greater than under exponential distribution. We also use simulations to compare GBS to an optimal policy for some cases where computing the optimal cost is tractable. The results show that our policy removes a majority of excess costs of CBS policy over the minimum cost, leading to much smaller optimality gaps.;math.PR
1801.02650;Higher order recurrences and row sequences of Hermite-Pad&#xe9, approximation;We obtain extensions of the Poincar\'e and Perron theorems for higher order recurrence relations and apply them to obtain an inverse type theorem for row sequences of (type II) Hermite-Pad\'e approximation of a vector of formal power series.;math.CV
1801.02654;Quiddity sequences for $\mathrm{SL}_3$-frieze patterns;The notion of a $(k,n)$-frieze pattern was introduced by the author as a generalisation of the classical frieze patterns. In this article we describe connections between classes of $(3,n)$-frieze patterns and classes of $\mathrm{SL}_3$-frieze patterns. We introduce the idea of a superimposed triangulation and clarify how superimposed triangulations may be used to understand quiddity sequences for $\mathrm{SL}_3$-frieze patterns.;math.CO
1801.02662;Tensor network ranks;In problems involving approximation, completion, denoising, dimension reduction, estimation, interpolation, modeling, order reduction, regression, etc, we argue that the near-universal practice of assuming that a function, matrix, or tensor (which we will see are all the same object in this context) has \emph{low rank} may be ill-justified. There are many natural instances where the object in question has high rank with respect to the classical notions of rank: matrix rank, tensor rank, multilinear rank --- the latter two being the most straightforward generalizations of the former. To remedy this, we show that one may vastly expand these classical notions of ranks: Given any undirected graph $G$, there is a notion of $G$-rank associated with $G$, which provides us with as many different kinds of ranks as there are undirected graphs. In particular, the popular tensor network states in physics (e.g., \textsc{mps}, \textsc{ttns}, \textsc{peps}) may be regarded as functions of a specific $G$-rank for various choices of $G$. Among other things, we will see that a function, matrix, or tensor may have very high matrix, tensor, or multilinear rank and yet very low $G$-rank for some $G$. In fact the difference is in the orders of magnitudes and the gaps between $G$-ranks and these classical ranks are arbitrarily large for some important objects in computer science, mathematics, and physics. Furthermore, we show that there is a $G$ such that almost every tensor has $G$-rank exponentially lower than its rank or the dimension of its ambient space.;math.NA
1801.02675;Wulff shapes and a characterization of simplices via a Bezout type inequality;Inspired by a fundamental theorem of Bernstein, Kushnirenko, and Khovanskii we study the following Bezout type inequality for mixed volumes $$ V(L_1,\dots,L_{n})V_n(K)\leq V(L_1,K[{n-1}])V(L_2,\dots, L_{n},K). $$ We show that the above inequality characterizes simplices, i.e. if $K$ is a convex body satisfying the inequality for all convex bodies $L_1, \dots, L_n \subset {\mathbb R}^n$, then $K$ must be an $n$-dimensional simplex. The main idea of the proof is to study perturbations given by Wulff shapes. In particular, we prove a new theorem on differentiability of the support function of the Wulff shape, which is of independent interest. <br />In addition, we study the Bezout inequality for mixed volumes introduced in <a href="/abs/1507.00765">arXiv:1507.00765</a> . We introduce the class of weakly decomposable convex bodies which is strictly larger than the set of all polytopes that are non-simplices.

1801.02679;Graph-Based Radio Resource Management for Vehicular Networks;This paper investigates the resource allocation problem in device-to-device (D2D)-based vehicular communications, based on slow fading statistics of channel state information (CSI), to alleviate signaling overhead for reporting rapidly varying accurate CSI of mobile links. We consider the case when each vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) link shares spectrum with multiple vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links. Leveraging the slow fading statistical CSI of mobile links, we maximize the sum V2I capacity while guaranteeing the reliability of all V2V links. We propose a graph-based algorithm that uses graph partitioning tools to divide highly interfering V2V links into different clusters before formulating the spectrum sharing problem as a weighted 3-dimensional matching problem, which is then solved through adapting a high-performance approximation algorithm.;cs.IT

1801.02688;Joint Resource Allocation and Antenna Selection In the Uplink of OFDMA Networks;The problem of joint sub-channel, power control and antenna selection in the uplink of OFDMA networks is investigated. The corresponding optimization problem is a non convex mixed integer non-linear problem(MINLP). To tackle the problem, an iterative two-step optimization problem is devised. First,~Having fixed the selected antenna as well as the associated power of each user,~a sub-channel assignment problem using the so-called Hungarian method is proposed. Second, the joint power and antenna selection problem is extended into a more elegant form through adding a penalty term to the objective function forcing the relaxed boolean variables associated with antenna selection problem to take binary values. To this end, the problem is restated as a difference of two concave function (DC programming) and is effectively solved in an iterative manner. The foregoing procedure is iteratively repeated until approaching a fixed network throughput. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method w.r.t. the exhaustive search with fixed power control mechanism.;cs.IT
1801.02692;L-spaces, left-orderability and two-bridge knots;We show that the 3-fold cyclic branched cover of any genus 2 two-bridge knot $K_{[-2q,2s,-2t,2l]}$ is an L-space and its fundamental group is not left-orderable. Therefore the family of 3-fold cyclic branched cover of any genus 2 two-bridge knot $K_{[-2q,2s,-2t,2l]}$ verifies the $L$-space conjecture. We also show that if $K_{[2k,-2l]}$ is a 2-bridge knot with $k\geq 2$, $l&gt,0$, then the fundamental group of the 5-fold cyclic branched cover of $K_{[2k,-2l]}$ is not left-orderable, which will complete the proof that the fundamental group of the 5-fold cyclic branched cover of any genus one two-bridge knot is not left-orderable.;math.GT

1801.02700;Mass-structure of weighted real trees;Rooted, weighted continuum random trees are used to describe limits of sequences of random discrete trees. Formally, they are random quadruples $(\mathcal{T},d,r,p)$, where $(\mathcal{T},d)$ is a tree-like metric space, $r\in\mathcal{T}$ is a distinguished root, and $p$ is a probability measure on this space. The underlying branching structure is carried implicitly in the metric $d$. We explore various ways of describing the interaction between branching structure and mass in $(\mathcal{T},d,r,p)$ in a way that depends on $d$ only by way of this branching structure. We introduce a notion of mass-structure equivalence and show that two rooted, weighted $\mathbb{R}$-trees are equivalent in this sense if and only if the discrete hierarchies derived by i.i.d. sampling from their weights, in a manner analogous to Kingman's paintbox, have the same distribution. We introduce a family of trees, called "interval partition trees" that serve as representatives of mass-structure equivalence classes, and which naturally represent the laws of the aforementioned hierarchies.;math.PR
1801.02701;Novel Impossibility Results for Group-Testing;In this work we prove non-trivial impossibility results for perhaps the simplest non-linear estimation problem, that of {\it Group Testing} (GT), via the recently developed Madiman-Tetali inequalities. Group Testing concerns itself with identifying a hidden set of $d$ defective items from a set of $n$ items via $t$ {disjunctive/pooled} measurements ("group tests"). We consider the linear sparsity regime, i.e. $d = \delta n$ for any constant $\delta &gt,0$, a hitherto little-explored (though natural) regime. In a standard information-theoretic setting, where the tests are required to be non-adaptive and a small probability of reconstruction error is allowed, our lower bounds on $t$ are the {\it first} that improve over the classical counting lower bound, $t/n \geq H(\delta)$, where $H(\cdot)$ is the binary entropy function. As corollaries of our result, we show that (i) for $\delta \gtrsim 0.347$, individual testing is essentially optimal, i.e., $t \geq n(1-o(1))$, and (ii) there is an {adaptivity gap}, since for $\delta \in (0.3471,0.3819)$ known {adaptive} GT algorithms require fewer than $n$ tests to reconstruct ${\cal D}$, whereas our bounds imply that the best nonadaptive algorithm must essentially be individual testing of each element. Perhaps most importantly, our work provides a framework for combining combinatorial and information-theoretic methods for deriving non-trivial lower bounds for a variety of non-linear estimation problems.;cs.IT
1801.02709;Derived categories and the genus of space curves;We generalize a classical result about the genus of curves in projective space by Gruson and Peskine to principally polarized abelian threefolds of Picard rank one. The proof is based on wall-crossing techniques for ideal sheaves of curves in the derived category. In the process, we obtain bounds for Chern characters of other stable objects such as rank two sheaves. The argument gives a proof for projective space as well. In this case these techniques also indicate an approach for a conjecture by Hartshorne and Hirschowitz and we prove first steps towards it.;math.AG
1801.02713;Duality of Channel Encoding and Decoding - Part II: Rate-1 Non-binary Convolutional Codes;This is the second part of a series of papers on a revisit to the bidirectional Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) soft-in-soft-out (SISO) maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) decoding algorithm. Part I revisited the BCJR MAP decoding algorithm for rate-1 binary convolutional codes and proposed a linear complexity decoder using shift registers in the complex number field. Part II proposes a low complexity decoder for rate-1 non-binary convolutional codes that achieves the same error performance as the bidirectional BCJR SISO MAP decoding algorithm. We observe an explicit relationship between the encoding and decoding of rate-1 convolutional codes in $GF(q)$. Based on this relationship, the BCJR forward and backward decoding are implemented by dual encoders using shift registers whose contents are vectors of complex numbers. The input to the dual encoders is the probability mass function (pmf) of the received symbols and the output of the dual encoders is the pmf of the information symbols. The bidirectional BCJR MAP decoding is implemented by linearly combining the shift register contents of the dual encoders for forward and backward decoding. The proposed decoder significantly reduces the computational complexity of the bidirectional BCJR MAP algorithm from exponential to linear with constraint length of convolutional codes. To further reduce complexity, fast Fourier transform (FFT) is applied. Mathematical proofs and simulation results are provided to validate our proposed decoder.;cs.IT

1801.02726;Near Maximum Likelihood Decoding with Deep Learning;A novel and efficient neural decoder algorithm is proposed. The proposed decoder is based on the neural Belief Propagation algorithm and the Automorphism Group. By combining neural belief propagation with permutations from the Automorphism Group we achieve near maximum likelihood performance for High Density Parity Check codes. Moreover, the proposed decoder significantly improves the decoding complexity, compared to our earlier work on the topic. We also investigate the training process and show how it can be accelerated. Simulations of the hessian and the condition number show why the learning process is accelerated. We demonstrate the decoding algorithm for various linear block codes of length up to 63 bits.;cs.IT
1801.02735;Gradient Method in Hilbert-Besov Spaces for the Optimal Control of Parabolic Free Boundary Problems;This paper presents computational analysis of the inverse Stefan type free boundary problem, where information on the boundary heat flux is missing and must be found along with the temperature and the free boundary. We pursue optimal control framework introduced in {\it U.G. Abdulla, Inverse Problems and Imaging, 7, 2(2013), 307-340,\ 10, 4(2016), 869--898}, where boundary heat flux and free boundary are components of the control vector, and optimality criteria consist of the minimization of the quadratic declinations from the available measurements of the temperature distribution at the final moment, phase transition temperature on the free boundary, and the final position of the free boundary. We develop gradient descent algorithm based on Frechet differentiability in Hilbert-Besov spaces complemented with preconditioning or increase of regularity of the Frechet gradient through implementation of the Riesz representation theorem. Three model examples with various levels of complexity are considered. Extensive comparative analysis through implementation of preconditioning and Tikhonov regularization, calibration of preconditioning and regularization parameters, effect of noisy data, comparison of simultaneous identification of control parameters vs. nested optimization is pursued.;math.OC
1801.02743;Enhancing Performance of Random Caching in Large-Scale Wireless Networks with Multiple Receive Antennas;To improve signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and make better use of file diversity provided by random caching, we consider two types of linear receivers, i.e., maximal ratio combining (MRC) receiver and partial zero forcing (PZF) receiver, at users in a large-scale cache-enabled single-input multi-output (SIMO) network. First, for each receiver, by utilizing tools from stochastic geometry, we derive a tractable expression and a tight upper bound for the successful transmission probability (STP). In the case of the MRC receiver, we also derive a closed-form expression for the asymptotic outage probability in the low SIR threshold regime. Then, for each receiver, we maximize the STP. In the case of the MRC receiver, we consider the maximization of the tight upper bound on the STP by optimizing the caching distribution, which is a non-convex problem. We obtain a stationary point, by solving an equivalent difference of convex (DC) programming problem using concave-convex procedure (CCCP). We also obtain a closed-form asymptotically optimal solution in the low SIR threshold regime. In the case of the PZF receiver, we consider the maximization of the tight upper bound on the STP by optimizing the caching distribution and the degrees of freedom (DoF) allocation (for boosting the signal power), which is a mixed discrete-continuous problem. Based on structural properties, we obtain a low-complexity near optimal solution by using an alternating optimization approach. The analysis and optimization results reveal the impact of antenna resource at users on random caching. Finally, by numerical results, we show that the random caching design with the PZF receiver achieves significant performance gains over the random caching design with the MRC receiver and some baseline caching designs.;cs.IT
1801.02745;Structural Results and Improved Upper Bounds on the Capacity of the Discrete-Time Poisson Channel;New capacity upper bounds are presented for the discrete-time Poisson channel with no dark current and an average-power constraint. These bounds are a simple consequence of techniques developed for the seemingly unrelated problem of upper bounding the capacity of binary deletion and repetition channels. Previously, the best known capacity upper bound in the regime where the average-power constraint does not approach zero was due to Martinez (JOSA B, 2007), which is re-derived as a special case of the framework developed in this paper. Furthermore, this framework is carefully instantiated in order to obtain a closed-form bound that noticeably improves the result of Martinez everywhere. Finally, capacity-achieving distributions for the discrete-time Poisson channel are studied under an average-power constraint and/or a peak-power constraint and arbitrary dark current. In particular, it is shown that the support of the capacity-achieving distribution under an average-power constraint only must be countably infinite. This settles a conjecture of Shamai (IEE Proceedings I, 1990) in the affirmative. Previously, it was only known that the support must be unbounded.;cs.IT

1801.02749;Degenerations and Lagrangian fibrations of Calabi-Yau manifolds;We discuss various topics on degenerations and special Lagrangian torus fibrations of Calabi-Yau manifolds in the context of mirror symmetry. A particular emphasis is on Tyurin degenerations and the Doran-Harder-Thompson conjecture, which builds a bridge between mirror symmetry for Calabi-Yau manifolds and that for quasi-Fano manifolds. The proof of the conjecture is of interest in its own right and leads us to a few other related topics such as SYZ mirror symmetry, theta functions and geometric quantization. Inspired by the conjecture, we also propose a new construction of Landau-Ginzburg models by splitting Calabi-Yau fibrations.;math.AG
1801.02751;A minimal closed-form solution to the conic based on self-polar triangle;In this paper, we use the properties of the self-polar triangle to not only show a novel method for a basic point-line enumerative problem of conics, but also present a series of closed-form solutions to the conics from all minimal configurations of points and lines in general position. These closed-form formulae may allow us to derive easily the algebraic and geometric conditions which characterize when the obtained conic is real and non-degenerate, so we propose a criterion for a non-degenerate real conic from each of all minimal configurations. The correctness of our results is validated by some examples.;math.AG
1801.02752;Equilibrium problems on Riemannian manifolds with applications;We study the equilibrium problem on general Riemannian manifolds. The results on existence of solutions and on the convex structure of the solution set are established. Our approach consists in relating the equilibrium problem to a suitable variational inequality problem on Riemannian manifolds, and is completely different from previous ones on this topic in the literature. As applications, the corresponding results for the mixed variational inequality and the Nash equilibrium are obtained. Moreover, we formulate and analyze the convergence of the proximal point algorithm for the equilibrium problem. In particular, correct proofs are provided for the results claimed in J. Math. Anal. Appl. 388, 61-77, 2012 (i.e., Theorems 3.5 and 4.9 there) regarding the existence of the mixed variational inequality and the domain of the resolvent for the equilibrium problem on Hadamard manifolds.;math.OC

1801.02758;On Two Dimensional Semi-Local Noetherian Spectra;In this article, we develop a technique to "split" certain types of partially ordered sets into simpler ones and use that technique to give a partial answer to a conjecture by R. Wiegand and S. Wiegand on the structure of semi-local, two-dimensional Noetherian spectra in their exposition on Noetherian prime ideals. Specifically, we show that very many two-dimensional posets with finitely many height two nodes that satisfy the necessary conditions of being the spectrum of a Noetherian ring, along with a very mild cardinality assumption, are in fact the spectrum of a Noetherian ring.;math.AC
1801.02759;An iteration regularizaion method with general convex penalty for nonlinear inverse problems in Banach spaces;In this paper, we discuss the construction, analysis and implementation of a novel iterative regularization scheme with general convex penalty term for nonlinear inverse problems in Banach spaces based on the homotopy perturbation technique, in an attempt to detect the special features of the sought solutions such as sparsity or piecewise constant. By using tools from convex analysis in Banach spaces, we provide a detailed convergence and stability results for the presented algorithm. Numerical simulations for one-dimensional and two-dimensional parameter identification problems are performed to validate that our approach is competitive in terms of reducing the overall computational time in comparison with the existing Landweber iteration with general convex penalty.;math.NA
1801.02761;An analytical proof for synchronization of stochastic phase oscillator;In this paper, we show that under a generic condition of the coefficient of a stochastic phase oscillator the Lyapunov exponent of the linearization along an arbitrary solution is always negative.

1801.02763;Homogeneous contact manifolds and resolutions of Calabi-Yau cones;In the present work we provide a constructive method to describe contact structures on compact homogeneous contact manifolds. The main feature of our approach is to describe the Cartan-Ehresmann connection (gauge field) for principal circle bundles over complex flag manifolds by using elements of representation theory of simple Lie algebras. This description allows us to compute explicitly the expression of the contact form for any Boothby-Wang fibration over complex flag manifolds as well as their induced homogeneous Sasaki-Einstein structures. As an application of our results we use the Cartan-Remmert reduction and the Calabi ansatz technique to provide many explicit examples of crepant resolutions of Calabi-Yau cones with certain homogeneous Sasaki-Einstein manifolds realized as links of isolated hypersurface singularities.;math.DG

1801.02767;Decompositions and measures on countable Borel equivalence relations;We show that the uniform measure-theoretic ergodic decomposition of a countable Borel equivalence relation $(X, E)$ may be realized as the topological ergodic decomposition of a continuous action of a countable group $\Gamma \curvearrowright X$ generating $E$. We then apply this to the study of the cardinal algebra $\mathcal K(E)$ of equidecomposition types of Borel sets with respect to a compressible countable Borel equivalence relation $(X, E)$. We also make some general observations regarding quotient topologies on topological ergodic decompositions, with an application to weak equivalence of measure-preserving actions.;math.LO
1801.02772;Restricted sum formula for finite and symmetric multiple zeta values;The sum formula for finite and symmetric multiple zeta values, established by Wakabayashi and the authors, implies that if the weight and depth are fixed and the specified component is required to be more than one, then the values sum up to a rational multiple of the analogue of the Riemann zeta value. We prove that the result remains true if we further demand that the component should be more than two or that another component should also be more than one.;math.NT
1801.02775;Bousfield localisation and colocalisation of one-dimensional model structures;We give an account of Bousfield localisation and colocalisation for one-dimensional model categories---ones enriched over the model category of $0$-types. A distinguishing feature of our treatment is that it builds localisations and colocalisations using only the constructions of projective and injective transfer of model structures along right and left adjoint functors, and without any reference to Smith's theorem.;math.CT
1801.02777;Nonlocal equations with regular varying decay solutions;We study the asymptotic behavior for nonlocal diffusion equations $\partial_tu=\mathcal{J}u-\chi_0u$ in $\mathbb{R}^n\times(0,\infty)$ and obtain a sufficient condition so that solutions of the Cauchy problem decay in time at the rate of a regular varying function. In the sufficient condition, a sharp bound of certain forms is required for the $k$-fold iterations $\mathcal{J}^ku_0$ or the kernels $J_k$. We prove the desired decay rate by analyzing the asymptotic behavior of a regular varying modified exponential series. Then we verify that the sufficient condition is true for most of the known radially symmetric kernels, and for some more general kernels, using the sharp Young's convolution inequality and a Fourier splitting argument. Classical results on the decay of solutions for these nonlocal diffusion equations are re-established and generalized. Finally, using our framework, we can exhibit a kernel having a prescribed regular varying decay solutions for a wide class of regular varying functions.;math.AP
1801.02779;Quantum walks with an anisotropic coin II: scattering theory;We perform the scattering analysis of the evolution operator of quantum walks with an anisotropic coin, and we prove a weak limit theorem for their asymptotic velocity. The quantum walks that we consider include one-defect models, two-phase quantum walks, and topological phase quantum walks as special cases. Our analysis is based on an abstract framework for the scattering theory of unitary operators in a two-Hilbert spaces setting, which is of independent interest.;math-ph
1801.02781;Minimum Throughput Maximization in UAV-Aided Wireless Powered Communication Networks;This paper investigates unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided wireless powered communication network (WPCN) systems where a mobile access point (AP) at the UAV serves multiple energy-constrained ground terminals (GTs). Specifically, the UAVs first charge the GTs by transmitting the wireless energy transfer (WET) signals in the downlink. Then, by utilizing the harvested wireless energy from the UAVs, the GTs send their uplink wireless information transmission (WIT) signals to the UAVs. In this paper, depending on the operations of the UAVs, we adopt two different scenarios, namely integrated UAV and separated UAV WPCNs. First, in the integrated UAV WPCN, a UAV acts as a hybrid AP in which both energy transfer and information reception are processed at a single UAV. In contrast, for the separated UAV WPCN, we consider two UAVs each of which behaves as an energy AP and an information AP independently, and thus the energy transfer and the information decoding are separately performed at two different UAVs. For both systems, we jointly optimize the trajectories of the UAVs, the uplink power control, and the time resource allocation for the WET and the WIT to maximize the minimum throughput of the GTs. Since the formulated problems are non-convex, we apply the concave-convex procedure by deriving appropriate convex bounds for non-convex constraints. As a result, we propose iterative algorithms which efficiently identify a local optimal solution for the minimum throughput maximization problems. Simulation results verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithms compared to conventional schemes.;cs.IT
1801.02782;UAV-Aided Wireless Communication Designs With Propulsion Energy Limitations;This paper studies unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided wireless communication systems where a UAV supports uplink communications of multiple ground nodes (GNs) while flying over the area of the interest. In this system, the propulsion energy consumption at the UAV is taken into account so that the UAV's velocity and acceleration should not exceed a certain threshold. We formulate the minimum average rate maximization problem and the energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem by jointly optimizing the trajectory, velocity, and acceleration of the UAV and the uplink transmit power at the GNs. As these problems are non-convex in general, we employ the successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. To this end, proper convex approximations for the non-convex constraints are derived, and iterative algorithms are proposed which converge to a local optimal point. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform baseline schemes for both problems. Especially for the EE maximization problem, the proposed algorithm exhibits about 109 % gain over the baseline scheme.;cs.IT
1801.02784;Spectral Radius of $\{0, 1\}$-Tensor with Prescribed Number of Ones;For any $r$-order $\{0, 1\}$-tensor $A$ with $e$ ones, we prove that the spectral radius of $A$ is at most $e^{\frac{r-1}{r}}$ with the equality holds if and only if $e={k^r}$ for some integer $k$ and all ones forms a principal sub-tensor ${\bf 1}_{k\times \cdots \times k}$. We also prove a stability result for general tensor $A$ with $e$ ones where $e=k^r+l$ with relatively small $l$. Using the stability result, we completely characterized the tensors achieving the maximum spectral radius among all $r$-order $\{0, 1\}$-tensor $A$ with $k^r+l$ ones, for $-r-1\leq l \leq r$, and $k$ sufficiently large.;math.CO
1801.02785;Fusion frames for operators and atomic systems;Recently, fusion frames and frames for operators were considered as generalizations of frames in Hilbert spaces. In this paper, we generalize some of the known results in frame theory to fusion frames related to a linear bounded operator K which we call K-fusion frames. We obtain new K-fusion frames by considering K-fusion frames with a class of bounded linear operators. We also study the stability of K-fusion frames under small perturbations. We further give some characterizations of atomic systems with subspace sequences.;math.FA
1801.02792;Balanced Truncation Model Reduction of a Nonlinear Cable-Mass PDE System with Interior Damping;We consider model order reduction of a nonlinear cable-mass system modeled by a 1D wave equation with interior damping and dynamic boundary conditions. The system is driven by a time dependent forcing input to a linear mass-spring system at one boundary. The goal of the model reduction is to produce a low order model that produces an accurate approximation to the displacement and velocity of the mass in the nonlinear mass-spring system at the opposite boundary. We first prove that the linearized and nonlinear unforced systems are well-posed and exponentially stable under certain conditions on the damping parameters, and then consider a balanced truncation method to generate the reduced order model (ROM) of the nonlinear input-output system. Little is known about model reduction of nonlinear input-output systems, and so we present detailed numerical experiments concerning the performance of the nonlinear ROM. We find that the ROM is accurate for many different combinations of model parameters.;math.OC
1801.02795;Asymptotics for Null-timelike Boundary Problems for General Linear Wave Equations;We study the linear wave equation $\Box_{g}u=0$ in Bondi-Sachs coordinates, for an asymptotically flat Lorentz metric $g$. We consider the null-timelike boundary problem, where an initial value is given on the null surface $\tau=0$ and a boundary value on the timelike surface $r=r_{0}$. We obtain spacetime $H^{p}$-estimates of $ru$ for $r&gt,r_0$ and derive an asymptotic exapnsion of $ru$ in terms of ${1}/{r}$ as $r\to\infty$.;math.AP
1801.02799;Flight Time Minimization of UAV for Data Collection over Wireless Sensor Networks;In this paper, we consider a scenario where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) collects data from a set of sensors on a straight line. The UAV can either cruise or hover while communicating with the sensors. The objective is to minimize the UAV's total flight time from a starting point to a destination while allowing each sensor to successfully upload a certain amount of data using a given amount of energy. The whole trajectory is divided into non-overlapping data collection intervals, in each of which one sensor is served by the UAV. The data collection intervals, the UAV's speed and the sensors' transmit powers are jointly optimized. The formulated flight time minimization problem is difficult to solve. We first show that when only one sensor is present, the sensor's transmit power follows a water-filling policy and the UAV's speed can be found efficiently by bisection search. Then, we show that for the general case with multiple sensors, the flight time minimization problem can be equivalently reformulated as a dynamic programming (DP) problem. The subproblem involved in each stage of the DP reduces to handle the case with only one sensor node. Numerical results present insightful behaviors of the UAV and the sensors. Specifically, it is observed that the UAV's optimal speed is proportional to the given energy of the sensors and the inter-sensor distance, but inversely proportional to the data upload requirement.;cs.IT
1801.02812;Quantitative Simplification of Filtered Simplicial Complexes;We introduce a new invariant defined on the vertices of a given filtered simplicial complex, called codensity, which controls the impact of removing vertices on persistent homology. We achieve this control through the use of an interleaving type of distance between fitered simplicial complexes. We study the special case of Vietoris-Rips filtrations and show that our bounds offer a significant improvement over the immediate bounds coming from considerations related to the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. Based on these ideas we give an iterative method for the practical simplification of filtered simplicial complexes. <br />As a byproduct of our analysis we identify a notion of core of a filtered simplicial complex which admits the interpretation as a minimalistic simplicial filtration which retains all the persistent homology information.;math.AT
1801.02818;k-connectivity of Random Graphs and Random Geometric Graphs in Node Fault Model;k-connectivity of random graphs is a fundamental property indicating reliability of multi-hop wireless sensor networks (WSN). WSNs comprising of sensor nodes with limited power resources are modeled by random graphs with unreliable nodes, which is known as the node fault model. In this paper, we investigate k-connectivity of random graphs in the node fault model by evaluating the network breakdown probability, i.e., the disconnectivity probability of random graphs after stochastic node removals. Using the notion of a strongly typical set, we obtain universal asymptotic upper and lower bounds of the network breakdown probability. The bounds are applicable both to random graphs and to random geometric graphs. We then consider three representative random graph ensembles: the Erdos-Renyi random graph as the simplest case, the random intersection graph for WSNs with random key predistribution schemes, and the random geometric graph as a model of WSNs generated by random sensor node deployment. The bounds unveil the existence of the phase transition of the network breakdown probability for those ensembles.;cs.IT

1801.02830;Beam domain secure transmission for massive MIMO communications;We investigate the optimality and power allocation algorithm of beam domain transmission for single-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with a multi-antenna passive eavesdropper. Focusing on the secure massive MIMO downlink transmission with only statistical channel state information of legitimate users and the eavesdropper at base station, we introduce a lower bound on the achievable ergodic secrecy sum-rate, from which we derive the condition for eigenvectors of the optimal input covariance matrices. The result shows that beam domain transmission can achieve optimal performance in terms of secrecy sum-rate lower bound maximization. For the case of single-antenna legitimate users, we prove that it is optimal to allocate no power to the beams where the beam gains of the eavesdropper are stronger than those of legitimate users in order to maximize the secrecy sum-rate lower bound. Then, motivated by the concave-convex procedure and the large dimension random matrix theory, we develop an efficient iterative and convergent algorithm to optimize power allocation in the beam domain. Numerical simulations demonstrate the tightness of the secrecy sum-rate lower bound and the near-optimal performance of the proposed iterative algorithm.;cs.IT

The proposed first and higher order moment closure methods enable numerical simulations of the kinetic equation. Their performance is then compared to that of the diffusion limit. The approach allows for DTI-based, patient-specific predictions of the tumor extent and its dynamic behavior.;math.NA

We also discuss the reductions of the MKP hierarchy to the modified $n$-KdV hierarchies. As a byproduct, we find an astonishingly simple explicit description of all polynomial tau-functions of the KP, the MKP and the $n$-KdV hierarchies, and (implicitly) also for the modified $n$-KdV hierarchy.;math-ph
1801.02846;Data assimilation and parameter estimation for a multiscale stochastic system with alpha-stable Levy noise;This work is about low dimensional reduction for a slow-fast data assimilation system with non-Gaussian $\alpha-$stable L\'evy noise via stochastic averaging. When the observations are only available for slow components, we show that the averaged, low dimensional filter approximates the original filter, by examining the corresponding Zakai stochastic partial differential equations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the low dimensional slow system approximates the slow dynamics of the original system, by examining parameter estimation and most probable paths.;math.DS
1801.02847;Partial regularity for solutions to subelliptic eikonal equations;On a bounded domain $\Omega$ in euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, we study the homogeneous Dirichlet problem for the eikonal equation associated with a system of smooth vector fields, which satisfies H\"ormander's bracket generating condition. We prove that the solution is smooth in the complement of a closed set of Lebesgue measure zero.;math.OC
1801.02849;Numerical inverse Laplace transform for convection-diffusion equations;In this paper a novel contour integral method is proposed for linear convection-diffusion equations. The method is based on the inversion of the Laplace transform and makes use of a contour given by an elliptic arc joined symmetrically to two half-lines. The trapezoidal rule is the chosen integration method for the numerical inversion of the Laplace transform, due to its well-known fast convergence properties when applied to analytic functions. Error estimates are provided as well as careful indications about the choice of several involved parameters. The method selects the elliptic arc in the integration contour by an algorithmic strategy based on the computation of pseudospectral level sets of the discretized differential operator. In this sense the method is general and can be applied to any linear convection-diffusion equation without knowing any a priori information about its pseudospectral geometry. Numerical experiments performed on the Black-Scholes ($1D$) and Heston ($2D$) equations show that the method is competitive with other contour integral methods available in the literature.;math.NA
1801.02856;Exponential stability of solutions to perturbed superstable wave equations;The paper deals with initial-boundary value problems for the linear wave equation whose solutions stabilize to zero in a finite time. We prove that problems in this class remain exponentially stable in $L^2$ as well as in $C^2$ under small bounded perturbations of the wave operator. To show this for $C^2$, we prove a smoothing result implying that the solutions to the perturbed problems become eventually $C^2$-smooth for any $H^1\times L^2$-initial data.;math.AP
1801.02860;Channel Estimation with Systematic Polar Codes;Study of polar codes in fading channels is of great importance when applying polar codes in wireless communications. Channel estimation is a fundamental step for communication to be possible in fading channels. For both systematic and non-systematic polar codes, construction of them is based on an information set and the known frozen bits. Efficient implementation of systematic and non-systematic polar codes exists. When it comes to channel estimation or channel tracking, additional pilot symbols are inserted in the codeword traditionally. In this paper, to improve the performance of polar codes in the finite domain, pilot symbols are selected from the coded symbols themselves. In order to keep the existing efficient structure of polar code encoding, pilot selection is critical since not all selections can reuse the existing structure. In this paper, two pilot selections denoted as Uneven Pilot Selection (UEPS) and Even Pilot Selection (EPS) are proposed, which do not change the efficient polar encoding structure. The proposed UEPS and EPS is proven to satisfy the efficient construction condition. The performance of EPS is shown in this paper to outperform both the UEPS and the traditional pilot insertion scheme. Simulation results are provided which verify the performance of the proposed pilot selection schemes.;cs.IT
1801.02867;A homogenization result for weak membrane energies;We prove a $\Gamma$-convergence result for space dependent weak membrane energies, that is for 'truncated quadratic potentials', that are quadratic below some threshold (depending on the pair of points that we are considering) and constant above. We prove that the limit surface energy density coincides with the one for spin systems, while the bulk energy density is not affected by the different levels of truncation and coincides with an purely elastic energy density.;math.AP
1801.02868;Linear Codes for Broadcasting with Noisy Side Information;We consider network coding for a noiseless broadcast channel where each receiver demands a subset of messages available at the transmitter and is equipped with noisy side information in the form an erroneous version of the message symbols it demands. We view the message symbols as elements from a finite field and assume that the number of symbol errors in the noisy side information is upper bounded by a known constant. This communication problem, which we refer to as 'broadcasting with noisy side information' (BNSI), has applications in the re-transmission phase of downlink networks. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a linear coding scheme to satisfy the demands of all the receivers in a given BNSI network, and show that syndrome decoding can be used at the receivers to decode the demanded messages from the received codeword and the available noisy side information. We represent BNSI problems as bipartite graphs, and using this representation, classify the family of problems where linear coding provides bandwidth savings compared to uncoded transmission. We provide a simple algorithm to determine if a given BNSI network belongs to this family of problems, i.e., to identify if linear coding provides an advantage over uncoded transmission for the given BNSI problem. We provide lower bounds and upper bounds on the optimal codelength and constructions of linear coding schemes based on linear error correcting codes. For any given BNSI problem, we construct an equivalent index coding problem. A linear code is a valid scheme for a BNSI problem if and only if it is valid for the constructed index coding problem.;cs.IT
1801.02871;Uniform decomposition of probability measures: quantization, classification, rate of convergence;The study of finite approximations of probability measures has a long history. In (Xu and Berger, 2017), the authors focus on constrained finite approximations and, in particular, uniform ones in dimension $d=1$. The present paper gives an elementary construction of a uniform decomposition of probability measures in dimension $d\geq 1$. This decomposition is then used to give upper-bounds on the rate of convergence of the optimal uniform approximation error. These bounds appear to be the generalization of the ones obtained in (Xu and Berger, 2017) and to be sharp for generic probability measures.;math.PR
1801.02873;Vanishing of Hyperelliptic L-functions at the Central Point;We obtain a lower bound on the number of quadratic Dirichlet L-functions over the rational function field which vanish at the central point $s = 1/2$. This is in contrast with the situation over the rational numbers, where a conjecture of Chowla predicts there should be no such L-functions. The approach is based on the observation that vanishing at the central point can be interpreted geometrically, as the existence of a map to a fixed abelian variety from the hyperelliptic curve associated to the character.;math.NT
1801.02875;Multi-Terminal Codes Using Constrained-Random-Number Generators;A general multi-terminal source code and a general multi-terminal channel code are presented. Constrained-random-number generators with sparse matrices, which are building blocks for the code construction, are used in the construction of both encoders and decoders. Achievable regions for source coding and channel coding are derived in terms of entropy functions, where the capacity region for channel coding provides an alternative to the region of [Somekh-Baruch and Verd\'u, ISIT2006].;cs.IT
1801.02876;Generalizations of Fano&#x27,s Inequality for Conditional Information Measures via Majorization Theory;Fano's inequality is one of the most elementary, ubiquitous, and important tools in information theory. Using majorization theory, Fano's inequality is generalized to a broad class of information measures, which contains those of Shannon and R\'{e}nyi. When specialized to these measures, it recovers and generalizes the classical inequalities. Key to the derivation is the construction of an appropriate conditional distribution inducing a desired marginal distribution on a countably infinite alphabet. The construction is based on the infinite-dimensional version of Birkhoff's theorem proven by R\'{e}v\'{e}sz [Acta Math. Hungar. 1962, 3, 188{\textendash}198], and the constraint of maintaining a desired marginal distribution is similar to coupling in probability theory. Using our Fano-type inequalities for Shannon's and R\'{e}nyi's information measures, we also investigate the asymptotic behavior of the sequence of Shannon's and R\'{e}nyi's equivocations when the error probabilities vanish. This asymptotic behavior provides a novel characterization of the asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) via Fano's inequality.;cs.IT
1801.02883;Mean-field evolution of fermions with singular interaction;We consider a system of N fermions in the mean-field regime interacting though an inverse power law potential $V(x)=1/|x|^{\alpha}$, for $\alpha\in(0,1]$. We prove the convergence of a solution of the many-body Schr\"{o}dinger equation to a solution of the time-dependent Hartree-Fock equation in the sense of reduced density matrices. We stress the dependence on the singularity of the potential in the regularity of the initial data. The proof is an adaptation of [22], where the case $\alpha=1$ is treated.;math-ph
1801.02885;Unlikely Intersections in families of abelian varieties and the polynomial Pell equation;Let S be a smooth irreducible curve defined over a number field k and consider an abelian scheme A over S and a curve C inside A, both defined over k. In previous works, we proved that when A is a fibered product of elliptic schemes, if C is not contained in a proper subgroup scheme of A, then it contains at most finitely many points that belong to a flat subgroup scheme of codimension at least 2. In this article, we continue our investigation and settle the crucial case of powers of simple abelian schemes of relative dimension g bigger or equal than 2. This, combined with the above mentioned result and work by Habegger and Pila, gives the statement for general abelian schemes. These results have applications in the study of solvability of almost-Pell equations in polynomials.;math.NT
1801.02888;Analysis of Massive MIMO and Base Station Cooperation in an Indoor Scenario;The performance of centralized and distributed massive MIMO deployments are analyzed for indoor office scenarios. The distributed deployments use one of the following precoding methods: (1) local precoding with local channel state information (CSI) to the user equipments (UEs) that it serves, (2) large-scale MIMO with local CSI to all UEs in the network, (3) network MIMO with global CSI. For the distributed deployments (2) and (3), it is shown that using twice as many base station antennas as data streams provides many of the massive MIMO benefits in terms of spectral efficiency and fairness. This is in contrast to the centralized deployment and the distributed deployment (1) where more antennas are needed. Two of the main conclusions are that distributing base stations helps to overcome wall penetration loss, however, a backhaul is required to mitigate inter-cell interference. The effect of estimation errors on the performance is also quantified.;cs.IT
1801.02890;Symbol-by-Symbol Maximum Likelihood Detection for Cooperative Molecular Communication;In this paper, symbol-by-symbol maximum likelihood (ML) detection is proposed for a cooperative diffusion-based molecular communication (MC) system. In this system, the transmitter (TX) sends a common information symbol to multiple receivers (RXs) and a fusion center (FC) chooses the TX symbol that is more likely, given the likelihood of its observations from all RXs. The transmission of a sequence of binary symbols and the resultant intersymbol interference are considered in the cooperative MC system. Three ML detection variants are proposed according to different RX behaviors and different knowledge at the FC. The system error probabilities for two ML detector variants are derived, one of which is in closed form. The optimal molecule allocation among RXs to minimize the system error probability of one variant is determined by solving a joint optimization problem. Also for this variant, the equal distribution of molecules among two symmetric RXs is analytically shown to achieve the local minimal error probability. Numerical and simulation results show that the ML detection variants provide lower bounds on the error performance of simpler, non-ML cooperative variants and demonstrate that these simpler cooperative variants have error performance comparable to ML detectors.;cs.IT
1801.02893;What did Ryser Conjecture?;Two prominent conjectures by Herbert J. Ryser have been falsely attributed to a somewhat obscure conference proceedings that he wrote in German. Here we provide a translation of that paper and try to correct the historical record at least as far as what was conjectured in it. The two conjectures relate to transversals in Latin squares of odd order and to the relationship between the covering number and the matching number of multipartite hypergraphs.;math.CO
1801.02894;Spatial Lattice Modulation for MIMO Systems;This paper proposes spatial lattice modulation (SLM), a spatial modulation method for multipleinput-multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The key idea of SLM is to jointly exploit spatial, in-phase, and quadrature dimensions to modulate information bits into a multi-dimensional signal set that consists oflattice points. One major finding is that SLM achieves a higher spectral efficiency than the existing spatial modulation and spatial multiplexing methods for the MIMO channel under the constraint ofM-ary pulseamplitude-modulation (PAM) input signaling per dimension. In particular, it is shown that when the SLM signal set is constructed by using dense lattices, a significant signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) gain, i.e., a nominal coding gain, is attainable compared to the existing methods. In addition, closed-form expressions for both the average mutual information and average symbol-vector-error-probability (ASVEP) of generic SLM are derived under Rayleigh-fading environments. To reduce detection complexity, a low-complexity detection method for SLM, which is referred to as lattice sphere decoding, is developed by exploiting lattice theory. Simulation results verify the accuracy of the conducted analysis and demonstrate that the proposed SLM techniques achieve higher average mutual information and lower ASVEP than do existing methods.;cs.IT
1801.02910;New bounds for exponential sums with a non-degenerate phase polynomial;We prove a recent conjecture due to Cluckers and Veys on exponential sums modulo $p^m$ for $m \geq 2$ in the special case where the phase polynomial $f$ is sufficiently non-degenerate with respect to its Newton polyhedron at the origin. Our main auxiliary result is an improved bound on certain related exponential sums over finite fields. This bound can also be used to settle a conjecture of Denef and Hoornaert on the candidate-leading Taylor coefficient of Igusa's local zeta function associated to a non-degenerate polynomial, at its largest non-trivial real candidate pole.;math.NT
1801.02912;Null Lagrangian Measures in subspaces, compensated compactness and conservation laws;Compensated compactness is an important method used to solve nonlinear PDEs. A simple formulation of a compensated compactness problem is to ask for conditions on a set $\mathcal{K}\subset M^{m\times n}$ such that $$ \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \mathrm{dist}(Du_n,\mathcal{K})\overset{L^p}{\rightarrow} 0\, \Rightarrow \{Du_{n}\}_{n}\text{ is precompact.} $$ Let $M_1,M_2,\dots, M_q$ denote the set of minors of $M^{m\times n}$. A sufficient condition for this is that any measure $\mu$ supported on $\mathcal{K}$ satisfying $$ \int M_k(X) d\mu (X)=M_k\left(\int X d\mu (X)\right)\text{ for }k=1,2,\dots, q $$ is a Dirac measure. We call measures that satisfy the above equation "Null Lagrangian Measures" and we denote the set of Null Lagrangian Measures supported on $\mathcal{K}$ by $\mathcal{M}^{pc}(\mathcal{K})$. For general $m,n$, a necessary and sufficient condition for triviality of $\mathcal{M}^{pc}(\mathcal{K})$ was an open question even in the case where $\mathcal{K}$ is a linear subspace of $M^{m\times n}$. We answer this question and provide a necessary and sufficient condition for any linear subspace $\mathcal{K}\subset M^{m\times n}$. The ideas also allow us to show that for any $d\in \left\{1,2,3\right\}$, $d$-dimensional subspaces $\mathcal{K}\subset M^{m\times n}$ support non-trivial Null Lagrangian Measures if and only if $\mathcal{K}$ has Rank-$1$ connections. This is known to be false for $d\ge 4$. <br />Using the ideas developed we are able to answer (up to first order) a question of Kirchheim, M\"{u}ller and Sverak on the Null Lagrangian measures arising in the study of a (one) entropy solution of a $2\times 2$ system of conservation laws that arises in elasticity.;math.AP
1801.02913;The DMT classification of real and quaternionic lattice codes;In this paper we consider space-time codes where the code-words are restricted to either real or quaternion matrices. We prove two separate diversity-multiplexing gain trade-off (DMT) upper bounds for such codes and provide a criterion for a lattice code to achieve these upper bounds. We also point out that lattice codes based on Q-central division algebras satisfy this optimality criterion. As a corollary this result provides a DMT classification for all Q-central division algebra codes that are based on standard embeddings.;cs.IT
1801.02920;On singularity properties of convolutions of algebraic morphisms;Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero, $X$ and $Y$ be smooth $K$-varieties, and let $V$ be a finite dimensional $K$-vector space. For two algebraic morphisms $\varphi:X\rightarrow V$ and $\psi:Y\rightarrow V$ we define a convolution operation, $\varphi*\psi:X\times Y\to V$, by $\varphi*\psi(x,y)=\varphi(x)+\psi(y)$. We then study the singularity properties of the resulting morphism, and show that as in the case of convolution in analysis, it has improved smoothness properties. <br />Explicitly, we show that for any morphism $\varphi:X\rightarrow V$ which is dominant when restricted to each irreducible component of $X$, there exists $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that for any $n&gt,N$ the $n$-th convolution power $\varphi^{n}:=\varphi*\dots*\varphi$ is a flat morphism with reduced geometric fibers of rational singularities (this property is abbreviated (FRS)). By a theorem of Aizenbud and Avni, for $K=\mathbb{Q}$, this is equivalent to good asymptotic behavior of the size of the $\mathbb{Z}/p^{k}\mathbb{Z}$-fibers of $\varphi^{n}$ when ranging over both $p$ and $k$. <br />More generally, we show that given a family of morphisms $\{\varphi_{i}:X_{i}\rightarrow V\}$ of complexity $D\in\mathbb{N}$ (i.e. that the number of variables and the degrees of the polynomials defining $X_{i}$ and $\varphi_{i}$ are bounded by $D$), there exists $N(D)\in\mathbb{N}$ such that for any $n&gt,N(D)$, the morphism $\varphi_{1}*\dots*\varphi_{n}$ is (FRS).;math.AG
1801.02921;The genericity of Arnold diffusion in nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems;In this paper, we prove that the net of transition chain is $\delta$-dense for nearly integrable positive definite Hamiltonian systems with 3 degrees of freedom in the cusp-residual generic sense in $C^r$-topology, $r\ge 6$. The main ingredients of the proof existed in \cite{CZ,C17a,C17b}. As an immediate consequence, Arnold diffusion exists among this class of Hamiltonian systems. The question of \cite{C17c} is answered in Section 9 of the paper.;math.DS
1801.02922;Groupoids and Wreath Products of Musical Transformations: a Categorical Approach from poly-Klumpenhouwer Networks;Transformational music theory, pioneered by the work of Lewin, shifts the music-theoretical and analytical focus from the "object-oriented" musical content to an operational musical process, in which transformations between musical elements are emphasized. In the original framework of Lewin, the set of transformations often form a group, with a corresponding group action on a given set of musical objects. Klumpenhouwer networks have been introduced based on this framework: they are informally labelled graphs, the labels of the vertices being pitch classes, and the labels of the arrows being transformations that maps the corresponding pitch classes. Klumpenhouwer networks have been recently formalized and generalized in a categorical setting, called poly-Klumpenhouwer networks. This work proposes a new groupoid-based approach to transformational music theory, in which transformations of PK-nets are considered rather than ordinary sets of musical objects. We show how groupoids of musical transformations can be constructed, and an application of their use in post-tonal music analysis with Berg's Four pieces for clarinet and piano, Op. 5/2. In a second part, we show how groupoids are linked to wreath products (which feature prominently in transformational music analysis) through the notion of groupoid bisections;math.GR
1801.02923;Wirtinger Numbers for Virtual Links;The Wirtinger number of a virtual link is the minimum number of generators of the link group over all meridional presentations in which every relation is an iterated Wirtinger relation arising in a diagram. We prove that the Wirtinger number of a virtual link equals its virtual bridge number. Since the Wirtinger number is algorithmically computable, it gives a more effective way to calculate an upper bound for the virtual bridge number from a virtual link diagram. As an application, we compute upper bounds for the virtual bridge numbers and the quandle counting invariants of virtual knots with 6 or fewer crossings. In particular, we found new examples of nontrivial virtual bridge number one knots, and by applying Satoh's Tube map to these knots we can obtain nontrivial weakly superslice links.;math.GT
1801.02926;Haantjes Algebras of the Lagrange Top;A symplectic-Haantjes manifold and a Poisson-Haantjes manifold for the Lagrange top are studied and a set of Darboux-Haantjes coordinates are computed. Such coordinates are separation variables for the associated Hamilton-Jacobi equation.;math-ph
1801.02927;Fibred Categories a la Jean Benabou;These are notes about the theory of Fibred Categories as I have learned it from Jean Benabou. I also have used results from the Thesis of Jean-Luc Moens from 1982 in those sections where I discuss the fibered view of geometric morphisms. Thus, almost all of the contents is not due to me but most of it cannot be found in the literature since Benabou has given many talks on it but most of his work on fibered categories is unpublished. But I am solely responsible for the mistakes and for misrepresentations of his views. And certainly these notes do not cover all the work he has done on fibered categories. I just try to explain the most important notions he has come up with in a way trying to be as close as possible to his intentions and intuitions. I started these notes in 1999 when I gave a course on some of the material at a workshop in Munich. They have developed quite a lot over the years and I have tried to include most of the things I want to remember.;math.CT
1801.02930;An Improved Analysis of Least Squares Superposition Codes with Bernoulli Dictionary;For the additive white Gaussian noise channel with average power constraint, sparse superposition codes, proposed by Barron and Joseph in 2010, achieve the capacity. While the codewords of the original sparse superposition codes are made with a dictionary matrix drawn from a Gaussian distribution, we consider the case that it is drawn from a Bernoulli distribution. We show an improved upper bound on its block error probability with least squares decoding, which is fairly simplified and tighter bound than our previous result in 2014.;cs.IT
1801.02932;Polynomials describing the multiplication in finitely generated torsion free nilpotent groups;A famous result of Hall asserts that the multiplication and exponentiation in finitely generated torsion free nilpotent groups can be described by rational polynomials. We describe an algorithm to determine such polynomials for all torsion free nilpotent groups of given Hirsch length. We apply this to determine the Hall polynomials for all such groups of Hirsch length at most 7.;math.GR
1801.02934;Unitarily invariant norm inequalities involving $G_1$ operators;In this paper, we present some upper bounds for unitarily invariant norms inequalities. Among other inequalities, we show some upper bounds for the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. In particular, we prove \begin{align*} \|f(A)Xg(B)\pm g(B)Xf(A)\|_2\leq \left\|\frac{(I+|A|)X(I+|B|)+(I+|B|)X(I+|A|)}{d_Ad_B}\right\|_2, \end{align*} where $A, B, X\in\mathbb{M}_n$ such that $A$, $B$ are Hermitian with $\sigma (A)\cup\sigma(B)\subset\mathbb{D}$ and $f, g$ are analytic on the complex unit disk $\mathbb{{D}}$, $g(0)=f(0)=1$, $\textrm{Re}(f)&gt,0$ and $\textrm{Re}(g)&gt,0$.;math.FA
1801.02942;The Petersen graph has no quantum symmetry;In 2007, Banica and Bichon asked whether the well-known Petersen graph has quantum symmetry. In this article, we show that the Petersen graph has no quantum symmetry, i.e. the quantum automorphism group of the Petersen graph is its usual automorphism group, the symmetric group $S_5$.;math.OA
1801.02952;The spectrum of the Laplacian on forms;In this article we prove a generalization of Weyl's criterion for the spectrum of a self-adjoint nonnegative operator on a Hilbert space. We will apply this new criterion in combination with Cheeger-Fukaya-Gromov and Cheeger-Colding theory to study the $k$-form essential spectrum over a complete manifold with vanishing curvature at infinity or asymptotically nonnegative Ricci curvature. <br />In addition, we will apply the generalized Weyl criterion to study the variation of the spectrum of a self-adjoint operator under continuous perturbations of the operator. In the particular case of the Laplacian on $k$-forms over a complete manifold we will use these analytic tools to find significantly stronger results for its spectrum including its behavior under a continuous deformation of the metric of the manifold.;math.DG
1801.02957;Topology of planar self-affine tiles with collinear digit set;We consider the self-affine tiles with collinear digit set defined as follows. Let $A,B\in\mathbb{Z}$ satisfy $|A|\leq B\geq 2$ and $M\in\mathbb{Z}^{2\times2}$ be an integral matrix with characteristic polynomial $x^2+Ax+B$. Moreover, let $\mathcal{D}=\{0,v,2v,\ldots,(B-1)v\}$ for some $v\in\mathbb{Z}^2$ such that $v,M v$ are linearly independent. We are interested in the topological properties of the self-affine tile $\mathcal{T}$ defined by $M\mathcal{T}=\bigcup_{d\in\mathcal{D}}(\mathcal{T}+d)$. Lau and Leung proved that $\mathcal{T}$ is homeomorphic to a closed disk if and only if $2|A|\leq B+2$. In particular, $\mathcal{T}$ has no cut point. We prove here that $\mathcal{T}$ has a cut point if and only if $2|A|\geq B+5$. For $2|A|-B\in \{3,4\}$, the interior of $\mathcal{T}$ is disconnected and the closure of each connected component of the interior of $\mathcal{T}$ is homeomorphic to a closed disk.;math.GN
1801.02962;Bayesian Fitting of Dirichlet Type I and II Distributions;In his 1986 book, Aitchison explains that compositional data is regularly mishandled in statistical analyses, a pattern that continues to this day. The Dirichlet Type I distribution is a multivariate distribution commonly used to model a set of proportions that sum to one. Aitchinson goes on to lament the difficulties of Dirichlet modelling and the scarcity of alternatives. While he addresses the second of these issues, we address the first. The Dirichlet Type II distribution is a transformation of the Dirichlet Type I distribution and is a multivariate distribution on the positive real numbers with only one more parameter than the number of dimensions. This property of Dirichlet distributions implies advantages over common alternatives as the number of dimensions increase. While not all data is amenable to Dirichlet modelling, there are many cases where the Dirichlet family is the obvious choice. We describe the Dirichlet distributions and show how to fit them using both frequentist and Bayesian methods (we derive and apply two objective priors). The Beta distribution is discussed as a special case. We report a small simulation study to compare the fitting methods. We derive the conditional distributions and posterior predictive conditional distributions. The flexibility of this distribution family is illustrated via examples, the last of which discusses imputation (using the posterior predictive conditional distributions).;math.ST
1801.02963;Gauge theory and foliations I, germ cords versus quantum cords;We apply gauge theory to study the space $F_k(M)$ of smooth codimension-$k$ framed foliations on a smooth manifold $M$. The quotient of Maurer-Cartan elements by the action of an infinite dimensional non-abelian gauge groupoid forms a moduli space, which contains $F_k(M)$ as a subspace. The notion of holonomy is naturally extended to this moduli space and the cohomology theory associated with points of this moduli space which correspond to non-singular foliations coincides with Bott cohomology. The quotient of the moduli space under concordance is identified as the space of homotopy classes of maps to the classifying spaces $B\Gamma^g_k$ and $B\Gamma^q_k$. While $B\Gamma^g$ is a classic and has been studied since Haefliger, $B\Gamma^q$ (which is a quotient of $B\Gamma^g$) carries a simpler topology and offers a rival theory.;math.DG
1801.02964;Quasi-shuffle algebras and renormalisation of rough differential equations;The objective of this work is to compare several approaches to the process of renormalisation in the context of rough differential equations using the substitution bialgebra on rooted trees known from backward error analysis of $B$-series. For this purpose, we present a so-called arborification of the Hoffman--Ihara theory of quasi-shuffle algebra automorphisms. The latter are induced by formal power series, which can be seen to be special cases of the cointeraction of two Hopf algebra structures on rooted forests. In particular, the arborification of Hoffman's exponential map, which defines a Hopf algebra isomorphism between the shuffle and quasi-shuffle Hopf algebra, leads to a canonical renormalisation that coincides with Marcus' canonical extension for semimartingale driving signals. This is contrasted with the canonical geometric rough path of Hairer and Kelly by means of a recursive formula defined in terms of the coaction of the substitution bialgebra.;math.PR
1801.02967;Asynchronous distributed algorithms for seeking generalized Nash equilibria under full and partial decision information;We investigate asynchronous distributed algorithms with delayed information for seeking generalized Nash equilibrium over multi-agent networks. The considered game model has all players' local decisions coupled with a shared affine constraint. We assume each player can only access its local objective function, local constraint, and a local block matrix of the affine constraint. We first give the algorithm for the case when each agent is able to fully access all other players' decisions. With the help of auxiliary edge variables and edge Laplacian matrix, each player can carry on its local iteration in an asynchronous manner, using only local data and possibly delayed neighbour information. And then we investigate the case when the agents cannot know all other players' decisions, which is called a partial decision case. We introduce a local estimation of the overall decisions for each agent in the partial decision case, and develop another asynchronous algorithm by incorporating consensus dynamics on the local estimations of the overall decisions. Since both algorithms do not need any centralized clock coordination, the algorithms fully exploit the local computation resource of each player, and remove the idle time due to waiting for the "slowest" agent. Both algorithms are developed by a preconditioned forward-backward operator splitting method, while convergence is shown with the help of asynchronous fixed-point iterations under proper assumptions and fixed step-size choices. Numerical studies verify both algorithms' convergence and efficiency.;math.OC
1801.02968;The set of vertices with positive curvature in a planar graph with nonnegative curvature;In this paper, we give the sharp upper bound for the number of vertices with positive curvature in a planar graph with nonnegative combinatorial curvature.

We also present a recent generalization of this construction due to Saroch which applies to factorization properties of maps, and yields a solution of an old problem by Auslander concerning existence of almost split sequences.;math.RT
1801.02973;Global fluctuations for 1D log-gas dynamics. (2) Covariance kernel and support;We consider the hydrodynamic limit in the macroscopic regime of the coupled system of stochastic differential equations, $ d\lambda_t^i=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} dW_t^i - V'(\lambda_t^i) dt+ \frac{\beta}{2N} \sum_{j\not=i} \frac{dt}{\lambda^i_t-\lambda^j_t}, \qquad i=1,\ldots,N, $ with $\beta&gt,1$, sometimes called generalized Dyson's Brownian motion, describing the dissipative dynamics of a log-gas of $N$ equal charges with equilibrium measure corresponding to a $\beta$-ensemble, with sufficiently regular convex potential $V$. The limit $N\to\infty$ is known to satisfy a mean-field Mc Kean-Vlasov equation. Fluctuations around this limit have been shown by the author to define a Gaussian process solving some explicit martingale problem written in terms of a generalized transport equation. <br />We prove a series of results concerning either the Mc Kean-Vlasov equation for the density $\rho_t$, notably regularity results and time-evolution of the support, or the associated hydrodynamic fluctuation process, whose space-time covariance kernel we compute explicitly.;math.PR
1801.02976;Binary CEO Problem under Log-Loss with BSC Test-Channel Model;In this paper, we propose an efficient coding scheme for the two-link binary Chief Executive Officer (CEO) problem under logarithmic loss criterion. The exact rate-distortion bound for a two-link binary CEO problem under the logarithmic loss has been obtained by Courtade and Weissman. We propose an encoding scheme based on compound LDGM-LDPC codes to achieve the theoretical bounds. In the proposed encoding, a binary quantizer using LDGM codes and a syndrome-coding employing LDPC codes are applied. An iterative joint decoding is also designed as a fusion center. The proposed CEO decoder is based on the sum-product algorithm and a soft estimator.;cs.IT
1801.02978;An EDG Method for Distributed Optimal Control of Elliptic PDEs;We consider a distributed optimal control problem governed by an elliptic PDE, and propose an embedded discontinuous Galerkin (EDG) method to approximate the solution. We derive optimal a priori error estimates for the state, dual state, the optimal control, and suboptimal estimates for the fluxes. We present numerical experiments to confirm our theoretical results.;math.NA
1801.02979;Steady-State Behavior of Some Load Balancing Mechanisms in Cloud Storage Systems;In large storage systems, files are often coded across several servers to improve reliability and retrieval speed. We consider a system of $n$ servers storing files using a Maximum Distance Separable code (cf. \cite{li2016mean}). Specifically, each file is stored in equally sized pieces across $L$ servers such that any $k$ pieces can reconstruct the original file. File requests are routed using the Batch Sampling routing scheme. I.e. when a request for a file is received, a centralized dispatcher routes the job into the $k$-shortest queues among the $L$ for which the corresponding server contains a piece of the file being requested. We study the long time behavior of this class of load balancing mechanisms. In particular, it is shown that the ODE system that describes the mean field limit of the occupancy measure process has a unique fixed point which is stable. This fixed point corresponds to a distribution on $\mathbb{N}_0$ of queue lengths with tails that decay super-exponentially. Upper and lower bounds on the decay rate are provided. Finally, we show that the unique invariant measure of the Markov occupancy measure process converges to the Dirac measure concentrated at the unique fixed point of the ODE system, establishing the interchangeability of the $t\to\infty$ and $n\to\infty$ limits.;math.PR
1801.02984;Cancellation of homothetic modules;Let R be a commutative ring, M an R-module, and N a finitely presented R-module such that the intersection of Max(R) and Supp(N) is finite-dimensional and Noetherian. Suppose also that N is homothetic, in other words, suppose that the natural ring homomorphism from R to the R-endomorphism ring of N is surjective. Working under these conditions, we describe various ways to guarantee the existence of a split surjective map in a specified coset of Hom(M,N). Using these results, we yield an extension of Bass's Cancellation Theorem that gives sufficient conditions for cancelling N or, more generally, a direct summand of a direct sum of finitely many copies of N. Since a canonical module of a Cohen-Macaulay ring is always finitely presented and homothetic, our work reveals a cancellation property of canonical modules of Cohen-Macaulay rings with finite-dimensional maximal spectra. Of note is that our results do not rely on any stable rank conditions.;math.AC
1801.02987;Multiplexing Analysis of Millimeter-Wave Massive MIMO Systems;This paper is concerned with spatial multiplexing analysis for millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive MIMO systems. For a single-user mmWave system employing distributed antenna subarray architecture in which the transmitter and receiver consist of Kt and Kr subarrays, respectively, an asymptotic multiplexing gain formula is firstly derived when the numbers of antennas at subarrays go to infinity. Specifically, assuming that all subchannels have the same average number of propagation paths L, the formula implies that by employing such a distributed antenna-subarray architecture, an exact average maximum multiplexing gain of KrKtL can be achieved. This result means that compared to the co-located antenna architecture, using the distributed antenna-subarray architecture can scale up the maximum multiplexing gain proportionally to KrKt. In order to further reveal the relation between diversity gain and multiplexing gain, a simple characterization of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff is also given. The multiplexing gain analysis is then extended to the multiuser scenario. Moreover, simulation results obtained with the hybrid analog/digital processing corroborate the analysis results.;cs.IT
1801.02988;Stability results for viscoelastic wave equation with dynamic boundary conditions;In this paper we consider wave viscoelastic equation with dynamic boundary condition in a bounded domain, we establish a general decay result of energy by exploiting the frequency domain method which consists in combining a contradiction argument and a special analysis for the resolvent of the operator of interest with assumptions on past history relaxation function.;math.AP
1801.02992;Blown-up intersection cochains and Deligne&#x27,s sheaves;In a series of papers the authors introduced the so-called blown-up intersection cochains. These cochains are suitable to study products and cohomology operations of intersection cohomology of stratified spaces. The aim of this paper is to prove that the sheaf versions of the functors of blown-up intersection cochains are realizations of Deligne's sheaves. This proves that Deligne's sheaves can be incarnated at the level of complexes of sheaves by soft sheaves of perverse differential graded algebras. We also study Poincar\'e and Verdier dualities of blown-up intersections sheaves with the use of Borel-Moore chains of intersection.;math.AT
1801.02993;Construction of the Poincare sheaf for higher genus curves;Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g$ and $L$ be a degree $l$ line bundle on $X$ with $l\geq 2g-1$. Denote the stack of rank two Higgs bundles on $X$ with value in $L$ by $\mathcal{H}iggs$ and the semistable part by $\mathcal{H}iggs_{ss}$. Let $H$ be the Hitchin base. In this paper we will construct the Poincare sheaf $\mathcal{P}$ on $\mathcal{H}iggs\times_{H}\mathcal{H}iggs_{ss}$ which is a maximal Cohen-Macaulay sheaf and flat over $\mathcal{H}iggs_{ss}$. In particular this includes the locus of nonreduced spectral curves.;math.AG
1801.02995;Cuspidal prehomogeneous vector spaces for reductive Lie groups and related algebraic and geometric structures;In this paper, we study the relations between left-invariant flat connections on Lie groups, left-symmetric algebras, symplective Lie algebras, Frobenius Lie algebras and cuspidal prehomogeneous vector spaces. More specifically, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between left-symmetric Lie algebras with a right identity and cuspidal prehomogeneous vector spaces of a Lie group. As an application of our approach, we study the classification of the reduced cuspidal prehomogeneous vector spaces (G,\r{ho},V) where G is a reductive Lie group. Fortunately, we prove that any of the left-symmetric structure on a reductive Lie algebra has a right identity. Then to give the complete classification of left-symmetric structure on reductive Lie algebras, we just need to give the classification of cuspidal prehomogeneous vector spaces for reductive Lie groups.;math.RT
1801.02996;Ascents in Non-Negative Lattice Paths;Non-negative {\L}ukasiewicz paths are special two-dimensional lattice paths never passing below their starting altitude which have only one single special type of down step. They are well-known and -studied combinatorial objects, in particular due to their bijective relation to trees with given node degrees. <br />We study the asymptotic behavior of the number of ascents (i.e., the number of maximal sequences of consecutive up steps) of given length for classical subfamilies of general non-negative {\L}ukasiewicz paths: those with arbitrary ending altitude, those ending on their starting altitude, and a variation thereof. Our results include precise asymptotic expansions for the expected number of such ascents as well as for the corresponding variance.;math.CO
1801.02997;Lagrangian torus fibration models of Fano threefolds;Inspired by the work of Gross on topological Mirror Symmetry we construct candidate Lagrangian torus fibration models for the 105 families of smooth Fano threefolds. We prove, in the case the second Betti number is one, that the total space of each fibration is homeomorphic to the expected Fano threefold, and show that the numerical invariants coincide for all 105. Our construction relies on a notion of toric degeneration for affine manifolds with singularities, and the correspondence we obtain between polytopes and Fano manifolds is compatible with that appearing in the work of Coates-Corti-Kasprzyk et al. on Mirror Symmetry for Fano manifolds.;math.GT
1801.02999;Exact asymptotics for a multi-timescale model, with applications in modeling overdispersed customer streams;In this paper we study the probability $\xi_n(u):={\mathbb P}\left(C_n\geqslant u n \right)$, with $C_n:=A(\psi_n B(\varphi_n))$ for L\'{e}vy processes $A(\cdot)$ and $B(\cdot)$, and $\varphi_n$ and $\psi_n$ non-negative sequences such that $\varphi_n \psi_n =n$ and $\varphi_n\to\infty$ as $n\to\infty$. Two timescale regimes are distinguished: a `fast' regime in which $\varphi_n$ is superlinear and a `slow' regime in which $\varphi_n$ is sublinear. We provide the exact asymptotics of $\xi_n(u)$ (as $n\to\infty$) for both regimes, relying on change-of-measure arguments in combination with Edgeworth-type estimates. The asymptotics have an unconventional form: the exponent contains the commonly observed linear term, but may also contain sublinear terms (the number of which depends on the precise form of $\varphi_n$ and $\psi_n$). To showcase the power of our results we include two examples, covering both the case where $C_n$ is lattice and non-lattice. Finally we present numerical experiments that demonstrate the importance of taking into account the doubly stochastic nature of $C_n$ in a practical application related to customer streams in service systems, they show that the asymptotic results obtained yield highly accurate approximations, also in scenarios in which there is no pronounced timescale separation.;math.PR
1801.03000;Some Properties of Kenmotsu Manifolds Admitting a Semi-symmetric Non-metric Connection;The aim of this paper is to study generalized recurrent, generalized Ricci-recurrent, weakly symmetric and weakly Ricci-symmetric Kenmotsu manifolds with respect to the semi-symmetric non-metric connection.;math.DG
1801.03004;Direct and inverse results on row sequences of simultaneous Pad&#xe9,-Faber approximants;Given a vector function ${\bf F}=(F_1,\ldots,F_d),$ analytic on a neighborhood of some compact subset $E$ of the complex plane with simply connected complement, we define a sequence of vector rational functions with common denominator in terms of the expansions of the components $F_k, k=1,\ldots,d,$ with respect to the sequence of Faber polynomials associated with $E$. Such sequences of vector rational functions are analogous to row sequences of type II Hermite-Pad\'e approximation. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence with geometric rate of the common denominators of the sequence of vector rational functions so constructed. The exact rate of convergence of these denominators is provided and the rate of convergence of the approximants is estimated. It is shown that the common denominators of the approximants detect the poles of the system of functions "closest" to $E$ and their order.;math.CV
1801.03005;On Self-Similar Lie Algebras and Virtual Endomorphisms;We introduce the notion of virtual endomorphisms of Lie algebras and use it as an approach for constructing self-similarity of Lie algebras. This is done in particular for a class of metabelian Lie algebras having homological type F Pn, which are variants of lamp-lighter groups. We establish several criteria when the existence of virtual endomorphism implies a self-similar Lie structure. Furthermore, we prove that the classical Lie algebra sln(k), where char(k) does not divide n affords non-trivial faithful self-similarity.;math.RA
1801.03008;Uniform Hausdorff dimension result for the inverse images of stable L&#xe9,vy processes;We establish a uniform Hausdorff dimension result for the inverse image sets of real-valued strictly $\alpha$-stable L\'evy processes with $1&lt, \alpha\le 2$. This extends a theorem of Kaufman for Brownian motion. Our method is different from that of Kaufman and depends on covering principles for Markov processes.;math.PR
1801.03013;Nonconvex Lagrangian-Based Optimization: Monitoring Schemes and Global Convergence;We introduce a novel approach addressing global analysis of a difficult class of nonconvex-nonsmooth optimization problems within the important framework of Lagrangian-based methods. This genuine nonlinear class captures many problems in modern disparate fields of applications. It features complex geometries, qualification conditions, and other regularity properties do not hold everywhere. To address these issues we work along several research lines to develop an original general Lagrangian methodology which can deal, all at once, with the above obstacles. A first innovative feature of our approach is to introduce the concept of Lagrangian sequences for a broad class of algorithms. Central to this methodology is the idea of turning an arbitrary descent method into a multiplier method. Secondly, we provide these methods with a transitional regime allowing us to identify in finitely many steps a zone where we can tune the step-sizes of the algorithm for the final converging regime. Then, despite the min-max nature of Lagrangian methods, using an original Lyapunov method we prove that each bounded sequence generated by the resulting monitoring schemes are globally convergent to a critical point for some fundamental Lagrangian-based methods in the broad semialgebraic setting, which to the best of our knowledge, are the first of this kind.;math.OC
1801.03014;On a Neumann problem for variational functionals of linear growth;We consider a Neumann problem for strictly convex variational functionals of linear growth. We establish the existence of minimisers among $\operatorname{W}^{1,1}$-functions provided that the domain under consideration is simply connected. Hence, in this situation, the relaxation of the functional to the space of functions of bounded variation, which has better compactness properties, is not necessary. Similar $\operatorname{W}^{1,1}$-regularity results for the corresponding Dirichlet problem are only known under rather restrictive convexity assumptions limiting its non-uniformity up to the borderline case of the minimal surface functional, whereas for the Neumann problem no such quantified version of strong convexity is required.;math.AP
1801.03016;Supersymmetric field theories from twisted vector bundles;We give a description of the delocalized twisted cohomology of an orbifold and the Chern character of a twisted vector bundle in terms of supersymmetric Euclidean field theories. This includes the construction of a twist functor for $1|1$-dimensional EFTs from the data of a gerbe with connection.;math.AT
1801.03017;Stochastic Optimization of Braking Energy Storage and Ventilation in a Subway Station;In the Paris subway system, stations represent about one third of the overall energy consumption. Within stations, ventilation is among the top consuming devices, it is operated at maximum airflow all day long, for air quality reasons. In this paper, we present a concept of energy system that displays comparable air quality while consuming much less energy. The system comprises a battery that makes it possible to recover the trains braking energy, arriving under the form of erratic and strong peaks. We propose an energy management system (EMS) that, at short time scale, controls energy flows and ventilation airflow. By using proper optimization algorithms, we manage to match supply with demand, while minimizing energy daily costs. For this purpose, we have designed algorithms that take into account the braking variability. They are based on the so-called Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) mathematical framework. We fairly compare SDP based algorithms with the widespread Model Predictive Control (MPC) ones. First, both SDP and MPC yield energy/money operating savings of the order of one third, compared to the current management without battery (our figure does not include the cost of the battery). Second, depending on the specific design, we observe that SDP outperforms MPC by a few percent, with an easier online numerical implementation.;math.OC
1801.03045;Slice regularity and harmonicity on Clifford algebras;We present some new relations between the Cauchy-Riemann operator on the real Clifford algebra $\mathbb R_n$ of signature $(0,n)$ and slice-regular functions on $\mathbb R_n$. The class of slice-regular functions, which comprises all polynomials with coefficients on one side, is the base of a recent function theory in several hypercomplex settings, including quaternions and Clifford algebras. In this paper we present formulas, relating the Cauchy-Riemann operator, the spherical Dirac operator, the differential operator characterizing slice regularity, and the {spherical derivative} of a slice function. The computation of the Laplacian of the spherical derivative of a slice regular function gives a result which implies, in particular, the Fueter-Sce Theorem. In the two four-dimensional cases represented by the paravectors of $\mathbb R_3$ and by the space of quaternions, these results are related to zonal harmonics on the three-dimensional sphere and to the Poisson kernel of the unit ball of $\mathbb R^4$.;math.CV
1801.03047;Invariant metrics on central extensions of Quadratic Lie algebras;A quadratic Lie algebra is a Lie algebra endowed with a symmetric, invariant and non degenerate bilinear form, such a bilinear form is called an invariant metric. The aim of this work is to describe the general structure of those central extensions of quadratic Lie algebras which in turn have invariantmetrics. The structure is such that the central extensions can be described algebraically in terms of the original quadratic Lie algebra, and geometrically in terms of the direct sum decompositions that the invariant metrics involvedgive rise to.;math.RA
1801.03048;Placement Delivery Array Design for Combination Networks with Edge Caching;A major practical limitation of the Maddah-Ali-Niesen coded caching techniques is their high subpacketization level. For the simple network with a single server and multiple users, Yan \emph{et al.} proposed an alternative scheme with the so-called placement delivery arrays (PDA). Such a scheme requires slightly higher transmission rates but significantly reduces the subpacketization level. In this paper, we extend the PDA framework and propose three low-subpacketization schemes for combination networks, i.e., networks with a single server, multiple relays, and multiple cache-aided users that are connected to subsets of relays. One of the schemes achieves the cutset lower bound on the link rate when the cache memories are sufficiently large. Our other two schemes apply only to \emph{resolvable} combination networks. For these networks and for a wide range of cache sizes, the new schemes perform closely to the coded caching schemes that directly apply Maddah-Ali-Niesen scheme while having significantly reduced subpacketization levels.;cs.IT
1801.03053;Generalized Toda flows;The classical hierarchy of Toda flows can be thought of as an action of the (abelian) group of polynomials on Jacobi matrices. We present a generalization of this to the larger groups of $C^2$ and entire functions, and in this second case, we also introduce associated cocycles and in fact give center stage to this object.;math.SP
1801.03054;Betti numbers of Bresinsky&#x27,s curves in $\mathbb{A}^{4}$;Bresinsky defined a class of monomial curves in $\mathbb{A}^{4}$ with the property that the minimal number of generators or the first Betti number of the defining ideal is unbounded above. We prove that the same behaviour of unboundedness is true for all the Betti numbers and construct an explicit minimal free resolution for this class.;math.AC
1801.03055;Deconvolving RNA Base Pairing Signals;A growing number of RNA sequences are now known to have distributions of multiple stable sequences. Recent algorithms use the list of nucleotides in a sequence and auxiliary experimental data to predict such distributions. Although the algorithms are largely successful in identifying a distribution's constituent structures, it remains challenging to recover their relative weightings. In this paper, we quantify this issue using a total variation distance. Then, we prove under a Nussinov-Jacobson model that a large proportion of RNA structure pairs cannot be jointly reconstructed with low total variation distance. Finally, we characterize the uncertainty in predicting conformational ratios by analyzing the amount of information in the auxiliary data.;math.CO
1801.03056;Discriminant-Stability in $p$-adic Lie Towers of Number Fields;In this paper we consider a tower of number fields $\cdots \supseteq K(1) \supseteq K(0) \supseteq K$ arising naturally from a continuous $p$-adic representation of $\mathrm{Gal}(\bar{\mathbb{Q}}/K)$, referred to as a $p$-adic Lie tower over $K$. A recent conjecture of Daqing Wan hypothesizes, for certain $p$-adic Lie towers of curves over $\mathbb{F}_p$, a stable (polynomial) growth formula for the genus. Here we prove the analogous result in characteristic zero, namely: the $p$-adic valuation of the discriminant of the extension $K(i)/K$ is given by a polynomial in $i,p^i$ for $i$ sufficiently large. This generalizes a previously known result on discriminant-growth in $\mathbb{Z}_p$-towers of local fields of characteristic zero.;math.NT
1801.03057;Galois gerbs and Lefschetz number formula for Shimura varieties of Hodge type;For any Shimura variety of Hodge type with hyperspecial level at a prime $p$ and a lisse sheaf on it, we prove a formula, conjectured by Kottwitz \cite{Kottwitz90}, for the Lefschetz number of an arbitrary Frobenius-twisted Hecke correspondence acting on the compactly supported \'etale cohomology and verify another conjecture of Kottwitz \cite{Kottwitz90} on the stabilization of that formula. The main ingredients of our proof of the formula are a recent work of Kisin \cite{Kisin17} on Langlands-Rapoport conjecture and the theory of Galois gerbs developed by Langlands and Rapoport \cite{LR87}. Especially, we use the Galois gerb theory to establish an effectivity criterion of Kottwitz triple, and mimic the arguments of Langlands and Rapoport of deriving the Kottwitz formula from their conjectural description of the $\Fpb$-point set of Shimura variety (Langlands-Rapoport conjecture). We do not assume that the derived group is simply connected, and also obtain partial results at (special) parahoric levels under some condition at $p$. For that, in the first part of our work we extend the results of Langlands and Rapoport to such general cases.;math.NT
1801.03061;Secure Communication over 1-2-1 Networks;This paper starts by assuming a 1-2-1 network, the abstracted noiseless model of mmWave networks that was shown to closely approximate the Gaussian capacity in [1], and studies secure communication. First, the secure capacity is derived for 1-2-1 networks where a source is connected to a destination through a network of unit capacity links. Then, lower and upper bounds on the secure capacity are derived for the case when source and destination have more than one beam, which allow them to transmit and receive in multiple directions at a time. Finally, secure capacity results are presented for diamond 1-2-1 networks when edges have different capacities.;cs.IT
1801.03066;Capacity Results for Intermittent X-Channels with Delayed Channel State Feedback;We characterize the capacity region of noiseless X-Channels with intermittent connectivity and delayed channel state information at the transmitters. We consider the general case in which each transmitter has a common message for both receivers, and a private message for each one of them. We develop a new set of outer-bounds that quantify the interference alignment capability of each transmitter with delayed channel state feedback and when each receiver must receive a baseline entropy corresponding to the common message. We also develop a transmission strategy that achieves the outer-bounds under homogeneous channel assumption by opportunistically treating the X-Channel as a combination of a number of well-known problems such as the interference channel and the multicast channel. The capacity-achieving strategies of these sub-problems must be interleaved and carried on simultaneously in certain regimes in order to achieve the X-Channel outer-bounds. We also extend the outer-bounds to include non-homogeneous channel parameters.;cs.IT
1801.03067;On statistical models on super trees;We consider a particular example of interplay between statistical models related to CFT on one hand, and to the spectral properties of ODE, known as ODE/IS correspondence, on the other hand. We focus at the representation of wave functions of Schr\"odinger operators in terms of spectral properties of associated transfer matrices on "super trees" (the trees whose vertex degree changes with the distance from the root point). Such trees with varying branchings encode the structure of the Fock space of the model. We discuss basic spectral properties of "averaged random matrix ensembles" in terms of Hermite polynomials for the transfer matrix of super trees. At small "branching velocities" we have related the problem of paths counting on super trees to the statistics of area-weighted one-dimensional Dyck paths. We also discuss the connection of the spectral statistics of random walks on super trees with the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang scaling.;math-ph
1801.03070;On Frobenius semisimplicity in Hida families;Let $p\geq 5$ be a prime and $\ell\neq p$ be a prime not dividing the tame level of a $p$-ordinary Hida family. We prove that the actions of the Frobenius element at $\ell$ on the Galois representations attached to almost all arithmetic specializations are semisimple and non-scalar. If $k_f$ denotes the weight of a cusp form $f(z)= \sum_{n\geq 1} a_\ell(f) e^{2\pi i n z}$, then the inequality $$|a_\ell(f) | \leq 2 \ell^{(k_f-1)/2},$$ predicted by the Ramanujan conjecture, is a strict inequality for almost all members $f$ of the family.;math.NT
1801.03072;A one-phase interior point method for nonconvex optimization;The work of Wachter and Biegler suggests that infeasible-start interior point methods (IPMs) developed for linear programming cannot be adapted to nonlinear optimization without significant modification, i.e., using a two-phase or penalty method. We propose an IPM that, by careful initialization and updates of the slack variables, is guaranteed to find a first-order certificate of local infeasibility, local optimality or unboundedness of the (shifted) feasible region. Our proposed algorithm differs from other IPM methods for nonconvex programming because we reduce primal feasibility at the same rate as the barrier parameter. This gives an algorithm with more robust convergence properties and closely resembles successful algorithms from linear programming. We implement the algorithm and compare with IPOPT on a subset of CUTEst problems. Our algorithm requires a similar median number of iterations, but fails on only 9% of the problems compared with 16% for IPOPT. Experiments on infeasible variants of the CUTEst problems indicate superior performance for detecting infeasibility. <br />The code for our implementation can be found at <a href="https://github.com/ohinder/OnePhase">this https URL</a> .;math.OC
1801.03078;A converse to Schreier&#x27,s index-rank formula;In "Subgroups of free profinite groups and large subfields of Q" (Israel J. Math. 39 (1981), no. 1-2, pages 25-45, MR 617288) A. Lubotzky and L. van den Dries raise the question whether a finitely generated, residually finite group is necessarily free if the rank function on its subgroups of finite index satisfies Schreier's well-known index rank relation (see Question 2 on p. 34). I answered this question in 1980 but, so far, I have not published my answer. This note fills the omission, it gives an amended and abridged version of my original proof.;math.GR
1801.03079;Asymmetry Hurts: Private Information Retrieval Under Asymmetric Traffic Constraints;We consider the classical setting of private information retrieval (PIR) of a single message (file) out of $M$ messages from $N$ distributed databases under the new constraint of \emph{asymmetric traffic} from databases. In this problem, the \emph{ratios between the traffic} from the databases are constrained, i.e., the ratio of the length of the answer string that the user (retriever) receives from the $n$th database to the total length of all answer strings from all databases is constrained to be $\tau_n$. This may happen if the user's access to the databases is restricted due database availability, channel quality to the databases, and other factors. For this problem, for fixed $M$, $N$, we develop a general upper bound $\bar{C}(\boldsymbol{\tau})$, which generalizes the converse proof of Sun-Jafar, where database symmetry was inherently used. Our converse bound is a piece-wise affine function in the traffic ratio vector $\boldsymbol{\tau}=(\tau_1, \cdots, \tau_N)$. For the lower bound, we explicitly show the achievability of $\binom{M+N-1}{M}$ corner points. For the remaining traffic ratio vectors, we perform time-sharing between these corner points. The recursive structure of our achievability scheme is captured via a system of difference equations. The upper and lower bounds exactly match for $M=2$ and $M=3$ for any $N$ and any $\boldsymbol{\tau}$. The results show strict loss of PIR capacity due to the asymmetric traffic constraints compared with the symmetric case of Sun-Jafar which implicitly uses $\tau_n=\frac{1}{N}$ for all $n$.;cs.IT
1801.03081;A proof of Bertrand&#x27,s theorem using the theory of isochronous potentials;We give an alternative proof for the celebrated Bertrand's theorem as a corollary of the isochronicity of a certain family of centers.;math.DS
1801.03082;Rational points and prime values of polynomials in moderately many variables;We derive the Hasse principle and weak approximation for pencils of certain varieties in the spirit of work by Colliot-Th\'el\`ene,Sansuc and Harpaz-Skorobogatov-Wittenberg. Our varieties are defined through polynomials in many variables and part of our work is devoted to establishing Schinzel's hypothesis for polynomials of this kind. This last part is achieved by using arguments behind Birch's well-known result regarding the Hasse principle for complete intersections with the notable difference that we prove our result in 50% fewer variables than in the classical Birch setting. We also study the problem of square-free values of an integer polynomial with 66.6% fewer variables than in the Birch setting.;math.NT
1801.03083;Smoluchowski&#x27,s discrete coagulation equation with forcing;In this article we study an extension of Smoluchowski's discrete coagulation equation, where particle in- and output takes place. This model is frequently used to describe aggregation processes in combination with sedimentation of clusters. More precisely, we show that the evolution equation is well-posed for a large class of coagulation kernels and output rates. Additionally, in the long-time limit we prove that solutions converge to a unique equilibrium with exponential rate under a suitable smallness condition on the coefficients.;math-ph
1801.03109;An operator-valued Lyapunov theorem;We generalize Lyapunov's convexity theorem for classical (scalar-valued) measures to quantum (operator-valued) measures. In particular, we show that the range of a nonatomic quantum probability measure is a weak*-closed convex set of quantum effects (positive operators bounded above by the identity operator) under a sufficient condition on the non-injectivity of integration. To prove the operator-valued version of Lyapunov's theorem, we must first define the notions of essentially bounded, essential support, and essential range for quantum random variables (Borel measurable functions from a set to the bounded linear operators acting on a Hilbert space).;math.FA
1801.03112;Fundamental Solutions and Decay of Fully Non-local Problems;In this paper, we study a fully non-local reaction-diffusion equation which is non-local both in time and space. We apply subordination principles to construct the fundamental solutions of this problem, which we use to find a representation of the mild solutions. Moreover, using techniques of Harmonic Analysis and Fourier Multipliers, we obtain the temporal decay rates for the mild solutions.;math.AP
1801.03116;Existence and continuity of solution trajectories of generalized equations with application in electronics;We consider a special form of parametric generalized equations arising from electronic circuits with AC sources and study the effect of perturbing the input signal on solution trajectories. Using methods of variational analysis and strong metric regularity property of an auxiliary map, we are able to prove the regularity properties of the solution trajectories inherited by the input signal. Furthermore, we establish the existence of continuous solution trajectories for the perturbed problem. This can be achieved via a result of uniform strong metric regularity for the auxiliary map. <br />Key words and phrases: generalized equations, electronic circuits, strong metric regularity, uniform strong metric regularity, perturbations.;math.OC
1801.03120;Limiting curves for the dyadic odometer and the generalized Trollope-Delange formula;We study limiting curves resulting from deviations in partial sums in the ergodic theorem for the dyadic odometer and non-cylindric functions. In particular, we generalize the Trollope-Delange formula for the case of the weighted sum-of-binary-digits function and show that the Takagi-Landsberg curve arises.;math.DS
1801.03122;A detailed treatment of Doob&#x27,s theorem;Doob's theorem provides guarantees of consistent estimation and posterior consistency under very general conditions. Despite the limitation that it only guarantees consistency on a set with prior probability 1, for many models arising in practice, Doob's theorem is an easy way of showing that consistency will hold almost everywhere. In this article, we give a detailed proof of Doob's theorem.;math.ST
1801.03123;Level-dependent interpolatory Hermite subdivision schemes and wavelets;We study many properties of level-dependent Hermite subdivision, focusing on schemes preserving polynomial and exponential data. We specifically consider interpolatory schemes, which give rise to level-dependent multiresolution analyses through a prediction-correction approach. A result on the decay of the associated multiwavelet coefficients, corresponding to a uniformly continuous and differentiable function, is derived. It makes use of the approximation of any such function with a generalized Taylor formula expressed in terms of polynomials and exponentials.;math.NA
1801.03134;On a $q$-analogue of the number of representations of an integer as a sum of two squares;Kassel and Reutenauer \cite{kassel2016fourier} introduced a $q$-analogue of the number of representations of an integer as a sum of two squares. We establish some connections between the prime factorization of $n$ and the coefficients of this $q$-analogue.;math.NT
1801.03142;Topological freeness for $C^*$-correspondences;We study conditions that ensure uniqueness theorems of Cuntz-Krieger type for relative Cuntz-Pimsner algebras $\mathcal{O}(J,X)$ associated to a $C^*$-correspondence $X$ over a $C^*$-algebra $A$. We give general sufficient conditions phrased in terms of a multivalued map $\widehat{X}$ acting on the spectrum $\widehat{A}$ of $A$. When $X(J)$ is of Type I we construct a directed graph dual to $X$ and prove a uniqueness theorem using this graph. When $X(J)$ is liminal, we show that topological freeness of this graph is equivalent to the uniqueness property for $\mathcal{O}(J,X)$, as well as to an algebraic condition, which we call $J$-acyclicity of $X$. <br />As an application we improve the Fowler-Raeburn uniqueness theorem for the Toeplitz algebra $\mathcal{T}_X$. We give new simplicity criteria for $\mathcal{O}_X$. We generalize and enhance uniqueness results for relative quiver $C^*$-algebras of Muhly and Tomforde. We also discuss applications to crossed products by endomorphisms.;math.OA
1801.03144;Reconstruction of piecewise smooth wave speeds using multiple scattering;Let $c$ be a piecewise smooth wave speed on $\mathbb R^n$, unknown inside a domain $\Omega$. We are given the solution operator for the scalar wave equation $(\partial_t^2-c^2\Delta)u=0$, but only outside $\Omega$ and only for initial data supported outside $\Omega$. Using our recently developed scattering control method, we prove that piecewise smooth wave speeds are uniquely determined by this map, and provide a reconstruction formula. In other words, the wave imaging problem is solvable in the piecewise smooth setting under mild conditions. We also illustrate a separate method, likewise constructive, for recovering the locations of interfaces in broken geodesic normal coordinates using scattering control.;math.AP
1801.03151;Domain-dependent stability analysis and parameter classification of a reaction-diffusion model on spherical geometries;In this work an activator-depleted reaction-diffusion system is investigated on polar coordinates with the aim of exploring the relationship and the corresponding influence of domain size on the types of possible diffusion-driven instabilities. Quantitative relationships are found in the form of necessary conditions on the area of a disk-shape domain with respect to the diffusion and reaction rates for certain types of diffusion-driven instabilities to occur. Robust analytical methods are applied to find explicit expressions for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the diffusion operator on a disk-shape domain with homogenous Neumann boundary conditions in polar coordinates. Spectral methods are applied using chebyshev non-periodic grid for the radial variable and Fourier periodic grid on the angular variable to verify the nodal lines and eigen-surfaces subject to the proposed analytical findings. The full classification of the parameter space in light of the bifurcation analysis is obtained and numerically verified by finding the solutions of the partitioning curves inducing such a classification. Furthermore, analytical results are found relating the area of (disk-shape) domain with reaction-diffusion rates in the form of necessary conditions for the different types of bifurcations. These results are on one hand presented in the form of mathematical theorems with rigorous proofs, and, on the other hand using finite element method, each claim of the corresponding theorems are verified by obtaining the theoretically predicted behaviour of the dynamics in the numerical simulations.;math.DS
1801.03152;Invariant measures for the periodic derivative nonlinear Schr&#xf6,dinger equation;We construct invariant measures associated to the integrals of motion of the periodic derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (DNLS) for small data in $L^2$ and we show these measures to be absolutely continuous with respect to the Gaussian measure. The key ingredient of the proof is the analysis of the gauge group of transformations associated to DNLS. As an intermediate step for our main result, we prove quasi-invariance with respect to the gauge maps of Gaussian measures on $L^2$.;math-ph
1801.03153;A New Coding Paradigm for the Primitive Relay Channel;We consider the primitive relay channel, where the source sends a message to the relay and to the destination, and the relay helps the communication by transmitting an additional message to the destination via a separate channel. Two well-known coding techniques have been introduced for this setting: decode-and-forward and compress-and-forward. In decode-and-forward, the relay completely decodes the message and sends some information to the destination, in compress-and-forward, the relay does not decode, and it sends a compressed version of the received signal to the destination using Wyner-Ziv coding. In this paper, we present a novel coding paradigm that provides an improved achievable rate for the primitive relay channel. The idea is to combine compress-and-forward and decode-and-forward via a chaining construction. We transmit over pairs of blocks: in the first block, we use compress-and-forward, and in the second block, we use decode-and-forward. More specifically, in the first block, the relay does not decode, it compresses the received signal via Wyner-Ziv, and it sends only part of the compression to the destination. In the second block, the relay completely decodes the message, it sends some information to the destination, and it also sends the remaining part of the compression coming from the first block. By doing so, we are able to strictly outperform both compress-and-forward and decode-and-forward. Note that the proposed coding scheme can be implemented with polar codes. As such, it has the typical attractive properties of polar coding schemes, namely, quasi-linear encoding and decoding complexity, and error probability that decays at super-polynomial speed. As a running example, we take into account the special case of the erasure relay channel, and we provide a comparison between the rates achievable by our proposed scheme and the existing upper and lower bounds.;cs.IT
1801.03163;Sufficient Conditions for the Tightness of Shannon&#x27,s Capacity Bounds for Two-Way Channels;New sufficient conditions for determining in closed form the capacity region of point-to-point memoryless two-way channels (TWCs) are derived. The proposed conditions not only relax Shannon's condition which can identify only TWCs with a certain symmetry property but also generalize other existing results. Examples are given to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed conditions.;cs.IT
1801.03165;Algebraic differential formulas for the shuffle, stuffle and duality relations of iterated integrals;In this paper we prove certain algebraic identities, which correspond to differentiations of the shuffle relation, the stuffle relation, and the relations which arise from M\"obius transformations of iterated integrals. These formulas provide fundamental and useful tools in the study of iterated integrals on a punctured projective line.;math.NT
1801.03172;Optimal Allocation of Series FACTS Devices in Large Scale Systems;Series FACTS devices, such as the variable series reactor (VSR), have the ability to continuously regulate the transmission line reactance so as to control power flow. This paper presents a new approach to optimally locating such devices in the transmission network considering multiple operating states and contingencies. To investigate optimal investment, a single target year planning with three different load patterns is considered. The transmission contingencies may occur under any of the three load conditions and the coupling constraints between base case and contingencies are included. A reformulation technique transforms the original mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model into mixed integer linear programing (MILP) model. To further relieve the computational burden and enable the planning model to be directly applied to practical large scale systems, a two phase decomposition algorithm is introduced. Detailed numerical simulation results on IEEE 118-bus system and the Polish 2383-bus system illustrate the efficient performance of the proposed algorithm.;math.OC

1801.03185;A Gaussian process framework for overlap and causal effect estimation with high-dimensional covariates;A powerful tool for the analysis of nonrandomized observational studies has been the potential outcomes model. Utilization of this framework allows analysts to estimate average treatment effects. This article considers the situation in which high-dimensional covariates are present and revisits the standard assumptions made in causal inference. We show that by employing a flexible Gaussian process framework, the assumption of strict overlap leads to very restrictive assumptions about the distribution of covariates, results for which can be characterized using classical results from Gaussian random measures as well as reproducing kernel Hilbert space theory. In addition, we propose a strategy for data-adaptive causal effect estimation that does not rely on the strict overlap assumption. These findings reveal the stringency that accompanies the use of the treatment positivity assumption in high-dimensional settings.;math.ST
1801.03186;Measure-valued spline curves: an optimal transport viewpoint;The aim of this article is to introduce and address the problem to smoothly interpolate (empirical) probability measures.

1801.03187;Choreographies in the Discrete Nonlinear Schr&#xf6,dinger Equations;We study periodic solutions of the discrete nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (DNLSE) that bifurcate from a symmetric polygonal relative equilibrium containing $n$ sites. With specialized numerical continuation techniques and a varying physically relevant parameter we can locate interesting orbits, including infinitely many choreographies. Many of the orbits that correspond to choreographies are stable, as indicated by Floquet multipliers that are extracted as part of the numerical continuation scheme, and as verified \textit{a posteriori} by simple numerical integration. We discuss the physical relevance and the implications of our results.;math.DS
1801.03189;A program for finding all KMS states on the Toeplitz algebra of a higher-rank graph;The Toeplitz algebra of a finite graph of rank $k$ carries a natural action of the torus ${\mathbb T}^k$, and composing with an embedding of ${\mathbb R}$ in ${\mathbb T}^k$ gives a dynamics on the Toeplitz algebra. For inverse temperatures larger than a critical value, the KMS states for this dynamics are well-understood, and this analysis is the first step in our program. At the critical inverse temperature, much less is known, and the second step in our program is an analysis of the KMS states at the critical value. This is the main technical contribution of the present paper. The third step shows that the problem of finding the states at inverse temperatures less than the critical value is equivalent to our original problem for a smaller graph. Then we can tackle this new problem using the same three steps, and repeat if necessary. So in principle, modulo some mild connectivity conditions on the graph, our results give a complete description of the simplex of KMS states at all inverse temperatures. We test our program on a wide range of examples, including a very general family of graphs with three strongly connected components.;math.OA

1801.03195;The Hypotheses on Expansion of Iterated Stratonovich Stochastic Integrals of Arbitrary Multiplicity and Their Partial Proof;In this review article we collected more than ten theorems on expansions of iterated Ito and Stratonovich stochastic integrals, which have been formulated and proved by the author. These theorems open a new direction for study of iterated Ito and Stratonovich stochastic integrals. The expansions based on multiple and iterated Fourier-Legendre series as well as on multiple and iterated trigonomectic Fourier series converging in the mean and pointwise are presented in the article. Some of these theorems are connected with the iterated stochastic integrals of multiplicities 1 to 5. Also we consider two theorems on expansions of iterated Ito stochastic integrals of arbitrary multiplicity $k$ $(k\in\mathbb{N})$ based on generalized multiple Fourier series converging in the sense of norm in Hilbert space $L_2([t, T]^k)$ as well as two theorems on expansions of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of arbitrary multiplicity $k$ $(k\in\mathbb{N})$ based on generalized iterated Fourier series converging pointwise. On the base of the presented theorems we formulate 3 hypotheses on expansions of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of arbitrary multiplicity $k$ $(k\in\mathbb{N})$ based on generalized multiple Fourier series converging in the sense of norm in Hilbert space $L_2([t, T]^k).$ The mentioned iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals are part of the Taylor-Stratonovich expansion. Moreover, the considered expansions of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals from these 3 hypotheses contain only one operation of the limit transition and substantially simpler than their analogues for iterated Ito stochastic integrals. Therefore, the results of the article can be useful for solution of the problem of numerical integration of Ito stochastic differential equations.;math.PR
1801.03197;On the Generalized Hardy-Rellich Inequalities;In this article, we look for the weight functions (say $g$) that admits the following generalized Hardy-Rellich type inequality: $ \int_{\Omega} g(x) u^2 dx \leq C \int_{\Omega} |\Delta u|^2 dx, \forall u \in \mathcal{D}^{2,2}_0(\Omega), $ for some constant $C&gt,0$, where $\Omega$ is an open set in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with $N\ge 1$. We find various classes of such weight functions, depending on the dimension $N$ and the geometry of $\Omega.$ Firstly, we use the Muckenhoupt condition for the one dimensional weighted Hardy inequalities and a symmetrization inequality to obtain admissible weights in certain Lorentz-Zygmund spaces. Secondly, using the fundamental theorem of integration we obtain the weight functions in certain weighted Lebesgue spaces. As a consequence of our results, we obtain simple proofs for the embeddings of $\mathcal{D}^{2,2}_0(\Omega)$ into certain Lorentz-Zygmund spaces proved by Hansson and later by Brezis and Wainger.;math.AP
1801.03198;Plane curves possessing two outer Galois points;We classify plane curves $\mathcal{C}$ possessing two Galois points $P_1$ and $P_2 \in \mathbb{P}^2 \setminus \mathcal{C}$ such that the associated Galois groups $G_{P_1}$ and $G_{P_2}$ generate the semidirect product $G_{P_1}\rtimes G_{P_2}$. In particular, a new characterization of Fermat curves is presented.;math.AG
1801.03203;A global maximum principle for optimal control of general mean-field forward-backward stochastic systems with jumps;In this paper we prove a necessary condition of the optimal control problem for a class of general mean-field forward-backward stochastic systems with jumps in the case where the diffusion coefficients depend on control, the control set does not need to be convex, the coefficients of jump terms are independent of control as well as the coefficients of mean-field backward stochastic differential equations depend on the joint law of $(X(t),Y(t))$. Two new adjoint equations are brought in as well as several new generic estimates of their solutions are investigated for analysing the higher terms, especially, those involving the expectation which come from the derivatives of the coefficients with respect to the measure. Utilizing these subtle estimates, the second-order expansion of the cost functional, which is the key point to analyse the necessary condition, is obtained, and whereafter the stochastic maximum principle.;math.OC
1801.03205;A Cantor set whose polynomial hull contains no analytic discs;A generalization of a result of Wermer concerning the existence of polynomial hulls without analytic discs is presented.

1801.03212;Sparse Isotropic Regularization for Spherical Harmonic Representations of Random Fields on the Sphere;This paper discusses sparse isotropic regularization for a random field on the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, where the field is expanded in terms of a spherical harmonic basis. A key feature is that the norm used in the regularization term, a hybrid of the $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_2$-norms, is chosen so that the regularization preserves isotropy, in the sense that if the observed random field is strongly isotropic then so too is the regularized field. The Pareto efficient frontier is used to display the trade-off between the sparsity-inducing norm and the data discrepancy term, in order to help in the choice of a suitable regularization parameter. A numerical example using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data is considered in detail. In particular, the numerical results explore the trade-off between regularization and discrepancy, and show that substantial sparsity can be achieved along with small $L_{2}$ error.;math.NA
1801.03214;Scattering and inverse scattering for nonlinear quantum walks;We study large time behavior of quantum walks (QWs) with self-dependent (nonlinear) coin. In particular, we show scattering and derive the reproducing formula for inverse scattering in the weak nonlinear regime. The proof is based on space-time estimate of (linear) QWs such as dispersive estimates and Strichartz estimate. Such argument is standard in the study of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations and discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations but it seems to be the first time to be applied to QW.;math-ph
1801.03215;The cycle structure of unicritical polynomials;A polynomial with integer coefficients yields a family of dynamical systems indexed by primes as follows: for any prime $p$, reduce its coefficients mod $p$ and consider its action on the field $\mathbb{F}_p$. The questions of whether and in what sense these families are random have been studied extensively, spurred in part by Pollard's famous "rho" algorithm for integer factorization (the heuristic justification of which is the randomness of one such family). However, the cycle structure of these families cannot be random, since in any such family, the number of cycles of a fixed length in any dynamical system in the family is bounded. In this paper, we show that the cycle statistics of many of these families are as random as possible. As a corollary, we show that most members of these families have many cycles, addressing a conjecture of Mans et. al.;math.DS
1801.03216;A counterexample to De Pierro&#x27,s conjecture on the convergence of under-relaxed cyclic projections;The convex feasibility problem consists in finding a point in the intersection of a finite family of closed convex sets. When the intersection is empty, a best compromise is to search for a point that minimizes the sum of the squared distances to the sets. In 2001, de Pierro conjectured that the limit cycles generated by the $\varepsilon$-under-relaxed cyclic projection method converge when $\varepsilon\downarrow 0$ towards a least squares solution. While the conjecture has been confirmed under fairly general conditions, we show that it is false in general by constructing a system of three compact convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$ for which the $\varepsilon$-under-relaxed cycles do not converge.;math.OC
1801.03217;Reduced critical processes for small populations;Let $\left\{ Z(n),n\geq 1\right\} $ be a critical Galton-Watson branching process with finite variance for the offspring size of particles. Assuming that $0&lt,Z(n)\leq \varphi (n)$, where either $\varphi (n)=an$ for some $a&gt,0$ or $\varphi (n)=o(n)$ as $n\rightarrow \infty $, we study the structure of the process $% \left\{ Z(m,n),0\leq m\leq n\right\} ,$ where $Z(m,n)$ is the number of particles in the process at moment $m\leq n$ having a positive number of descendants at moment $n$.;math.PR
1801.03221;Compatible systems and ramification;We show that compatible systems of $\ell$-adic sheaves on a scheme of finite type over the ring of integers of a local field are compatible along the boundary up to stratification. This extends a theorem of Deligne on curves over a finite field. As an application, we deduce the equicharacteristic case of classical conjectures on $\ell$-independence for proper smooth varieties over complete discrete valuation fields. Moreover, we show that compatible systems have compatible ramification. We also prove an analogue for integrality along the boundary.;math.AG
1801.03229;Fixed points of automorphisms of certain non-cyclic $p$-groups and the dihedral group;Let $G=\mathbf{Z}_{p} \oplus \mathbf{Z}_{p^2}$, where $p$ is a prime number. Suppose that $d$ is a divisor of the order of $G$. In this paper we find the number of automorphisms of $G$ fixing $d$ elements of $G$, and denote it by $\theta(G,d)$. As a consequence, we prove a conjecture of Checco-Darling-Longfield-Wisdom. We also find the exact number of fixed-point-free automorphisms of the group $\mathbf{Z}_{p^{a}} \oplus \mathbf{Z}_{p^{b}}$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers with $a&lt,b$. Finally, we compute $\theta(D_{2q},d)$, where $D_{2q}$ is the dihedral group of order $2q$, $q$ is an odd prime and $d \in \{1,q,2q\}$.;math.GR
1801.03232;$U(\fh)$-free modules over the Block algebra $\BB(q)$;In this paper, we construct a new class of modules over the Block algebra $\BB(q)$, where $q$ is a nonzero complex number. We determined the irreducibilities of these modules and the isomorphisms among them.;math.RT
1801.03234;Optimal linear responses for Markov chains and stochastically perturbed dynamical systems;The linear response of a dynamical system refers to changes to properties of the system when small external perturbations are applied. We consider the little-studied question of selecting an optimal perturbation so as to (i) maximise the linear response of the equilibrium distribution of the system, (ii) maximise the linear response of the expectation of a specified observable, and (iii) maximise the linear response of the rate of convergence of the system to the equilibrium distribution. We also consider the inhomogeneous or time-dependent situation where the governing dynamics is not stationary and one wishes to select a sequence of small perturbations so as to maximise the overall linear response at some terminal time. We develop the theory for finite-state Markov chains, provide explicit solutions for some illustrative examples, and numerically apply our theory to stochastically perturbed dynamical systems, where the Markov chain is replaced by a matrix representation of an approximate annealed transfer operator for the random dynamical system.;math.DS
1801.03235;Combating Error Propagation in Window Decoding of Braided Convolutional Codes;In this paper, we study sliding window decoding of braided convolutional codes (BCCs) in the context of a streaming application, where decoder error propagation can be a serious problem. A window extension algorithm and a resynchronization mechanism are introduced to mitigate the effect of error propagation. In addition, we introduce a soft bit-error-rate stopping rule to reduce computational complexity, and the tradeoff between performance and complexity is examined. Simulation results show that, using the proposed window extension algorithm and resynchronization mechanism, the error performance of BCCs can be improved by up to three orders of magnitude with reduced computational complexity.;cs.IT

On the latter, we construct invariant distributions and thus fill a gap in the literature by giving infinitely many linearly independent triple products of induced representations.;math.RT
1801.03255;When Exploiting Individual User Preference Is Beneficial for Caching at Base Stations;Most of prior works optimize caching policies based on the following assumptions: 1) every user initiates request according to content popularity, 2) all users are with the same active level, and 3) users are uniformly located in the considered region. In practice, these assumptions are often not true. In this paper, we explore the benefit of optimizing caching policies for base stations by exploiting user preference considering the spatial locality and different active level of users. We obtain optimal caching policies, respectively minimizing the download delay averaged over all file requests and user locations in the network (namely network average delay), and minimizing the maximal weighted download delay averaged over the file requests and location of each user (namely maximal weighted user average delay), as well as minimizing the weighted sum of both. The analysis and simulation results show that exploiting heterogeneous user preference and active level can improve user fairness, and can also improve network performance when users are with spatial locality.;cs.IT
1801.03258;Exploiting structure of chance constrained programs via submodularity;We introduce a novel approach to reduce the computational effort of solving mixed-integer convex chance constrained programs through the scenario approach. Instead of reducing the number of required scenarios, we directly minimize the computational cost of the scenario program. We exploit the problem structure by efficiently partitioning the constraint function and considering a multiple chance constrained program that gives the same probabilistic guarantees as the original single chance constrained problem. We formulate the problem of finding the optimal partition, a partition achieving the lowest computational cost, as an optimization problem with nonlinear objective and combinatorial constraints. By using submodularity of the support rank of a set of constraints, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm to find suboptimal solutions to this partitioning problem and we give approximation guarantees for special classes of cost metrics. We illustrate that the resulting computational cost savings can be arbitrarily large and demonstrate our approach on two case studies from production and multi-agent planning.;math.OC
1801.03259;Asymptotically Optimal Scheduling for Compute-and-Forward;Consider a Compute and Forward (CF) relay network with $L$ users and a single relay. The relay tries to decode a linear function of the transmitted signals. For such a network, letting all $L$ users transmit simultaneously, especially when $L$ is large, causes a significant degradation in the rate in which the relay is able to decode. In fact, the rate goes to zero very fast with $L$. Therefore, in each transmission phase only a fixed number of users should transmit, i.e., users should be scheduled. <br />In this work, we examine the problem of scheduling for CF and lay the foundations for identifying the optimal schedule which, to date, lacks a clear understanding. Specifically, we start with insights why when the number of users is large, good scheduling opportunities can be found. Then, we provide an asymptotically optimal, polynomial time scheduling algorithm and analyze it's performance. We conclude that scheduling under CF provides a gain in the system sum-rate, up to the optimal scaling law of $O(\log{\log{L}})$.;cs.IT

We propose a novel non-iterative reconstruction method for solving the aforementioned inverse problem from far-field measurements. The method is based on recovering the Fourier coefficients of the unknown source. A key ingredient of the method is to establish the relationship between the Fourier coefficients and the multi-frequency far-field data. Uniqueness and stability results are established for the proposed reconstruction method. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the method.;math.AP

1801.03266;Improved Time of Arrival measurement model for non-convex optimization;The quadratic system provided by the Time of Arrival technique can be solved analytically or by optimization algorithms. In practice, a combination of both methods is used. An important problem in quadratic optimization is the possible convergence to a local minimum, instead of the global minimum. This article presents an approach how this risk can be significantly reduced. The main idea of our approach is to transform the local minimum to a saddle point, by increasing the number of dimensions. In contrast to similar methods such as, dimension lifting does our problem remains non-convex.;math.OC
1801.03271;Existence and non-existence of maximizers for the Moser-Trudinger type inequalities under inhomogeneous constraints;In this paper, we study the existence and non-existence of maximizers for the Moser-Trudinger type inequalities in $\Bbb R^N$ of the form <br />\[ <br />D_{N,\alpha}(a,b):= <br />\sup_{u\in W^{1,N}(\Bbb R^N),\,\|\nabla u\|_{L^N(\Bbb R^N)}^a+\|u\|_{L^N(\Bbb R^N)}^b=1} <br />\int_{\Bbb R^N}\Phi_N\left(\alpha|u|^{N'}\right)dx. <br />\] Here $N\geq 2$, $N'=\frac{N}{N-1}$, $a,b&gt,0$, $\alpha \in (0,\alpha_N]$ and $\Phi_N(t):=e^t-\sum_{j=0}^{N-2}\frac{t^j}{j!}$ where $\alpha_N:= N \omega_{N-1}^{1/(N-1)}$ and $\omega_{N-1}$ denotes the surface area of the unit ball in $\Bbb R^N$. We show the existence of the threshold $\alpha_\ast = \alpha_\ast(a,b,N) \in [0,\alpha_N]$ such that $D_{N,\alpha}(a,b)$ is not attained if $\alpha \in (0,\alpha_\ast)$ and is attained if $ \alpha \in (\alpha_\ast , \alpha_N)$. We also provide the conditions on $(a,b)$ in order that the inequality $\alpha_\ast &lt, \alpha_N$ holds.;math.AP
1801.03280;Algebraic separatrices for non-dicritical foliations on projective spaces of dimension at least four;Non-dicritical codimension one foliations on projective spaces of dimension four or higher always have an invariant algebraic hypersurface. The proof relies on a strengthening of a result by Rossi on the algebraization/continuation of analytic subvarieties of projective spaces.;math.AG
1801.03284;Markovian tricks for non-Markovian trees: contour process, extinction and scaling limits;In this work, we study a family of non-Markovian trees modeling populations where individuals live and reproduce independently with possibly time-dependent birth-rate and lifetime distribution. To this end, we use the coding process introduced by Lambert. We show that, in our situation, this process is no longer a L{\'e}vy process but remains a Feller process and we give a complete characterization of its generator. This allows us to study the model through well-known Markov processes techniques. On one hand, introducing a scale function for such processes allows us to get necessary and sufficient conditions for extinction or non-extinction and to characterize the law of such trees conditioned on these events. On the other hand, using Lyapounov drift techniques , we get another set of, easily checkable, sufficient criteria for extinction or non-extinction and some tail estimates for the tree length. Finally, we also study scaling limits of such random trees and observe that the Bessel tree appears naturally.;math.PR
1801.03287;Convergence of Pascal-Like Triangles in Parry-Bertrand Numeration Systems;We pursue the investigation of generalizations of the Pascal triangle based on binomial coefficients of finite words. These coefficients count the number of times a finite word appears as a subsequence of another finite word. The finite words occurring in this paper belong to the language of a Parry numeration system satisfying the Bertrand property, i.e., we can add or remove trailing zeroes to valid representations. It is a folklore fact that the Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket is the limit set, for the Hausdorff distance, of a convergent sequence of normalized compact blocks extracted from the classical Pascal triangle modulo $2$. In a similar way, we describe and study the subset of $[0, 1] \times [0, 1]$ associated with the latter generalization of the Pascal triangle modulo a prime number.;math.CO
1801.03300;Shapley effects for sensitivity analysis with dependent inputs: bootstrap and kriging-based algorithms;In global sensitivity analysis, the well known Sobol' sensitivity indices aim to quantify how the variance in the output of a mathematical model can be apportioned to the different variances of its input random variables. These indices are based on the functional variance decomposition and their interpretation become difficult in the presence of statistical dependence between the inputs. However, as there is dependence in many application studies, that enhances the development of interpretable sensitivity indices. Recently, the Shapley values developed in the field of cooperative games theory have been connected to global sensitivity analysis and present good properties in the presence of dependencies. Nevertheless, the available estimation methods don't always provide confidence intervals and require a large number of model evaluation. In this paper, we implement a bootstrap sampling in the existing algorithms to estimate confidence intervals of the indice estimations. We also proposed to consider a metamodel in substitution of a costly numerical model. The estimation error from the Monte-Carlo sampling is combined with the metamodel error in order to have confidence intervals on the Shapley effects. Besides, we compare for different examples with dependent random variables the results of the Shapley effects with existing extensions of the Sobol' indices.;math.ST
1801.03302;An improvement in the linear stable ranges for ordered configuration spaces;Recently, Church-Miller-Nagpal-Reinhold [<a href="/abs/1706.03845">arXiv:1706.03845</a>] obtained linear stable ranges for the integral cohomology of ordered configuration spaces, in the sense of representation stability. We note that the constants in these linear stable ranges can be further improved for an orientable manifold of dimension at least 3. The idea is to simply exploit the sparsity of Totaro's spectral sequence.;math.RT
1801.03308;On minimal actions of countable groups;Our purpose here is to review some recent developments in the theory of dynamical systems whose common theme is a link between minimal dynamical systems, certain Ramsey type combinatorial properties, and the Lovasz local lemma (LLL). For a general countable group G the two classes of minimal systems we will deal with are (I) the minimal subsystems of the {\em subgroup system} (Sub(G), G), called URS's (uniformly recurrent subgroups), and (II) minimal {\em subshifts}, i.e. subsystems of the binary Bernoulli G-shift ({0, 1}^G, {\sig_g}_{g \in G}).;math.DS
1801.03313;The Reidemeister graph is a complete knot invariant;We describe two locally finite graphs naturally associated to each knot type K, called Reidemeister graphs. We determine several local and global properties of these graphs and prove that in one case the graph-isomorphism type is a complete knot invariant up to mirroring. Lastly, we introduce another object, relating the Reidemeister and Gordian graphs, and determine some of its properties.;math.GT
1801.03319;No eigenvalues outside the limiting support of the spectral distribution of general sample covariance matrices;This paper is to investigate the spectral properties of sample covariance matrices under a more general population. We consider a class of matrices of the form $\mathbf S_n=\frac1n\mathbf B_n\mathbf X_n\mathbf X_n^*\mathbf B_n^*$, where $\mathbf B_n$ is a $p\times m$ non-random matrix and $\mathbf X_n$ is an $m\times n$ matrix consisting of i.i.d standard complex entries. $p/n\to c\in (0,\infty)$ as $n\to \infty$ while $m$ can be arbitrary. We proved that under some mild assumptions, with probability 1, there will be no eigenvalues in any closed interval contained in an open interval outside the supports of the limiting distribution $F_{c_n,H_n}$, for all sufficiently large $n$. An extension of Bai-Yin law is also obtained.;math.PR
1801.03320;A Canonical Form for a Symplectic Involution;We present a canonical form for a symplectic involution $S\in Sp(2g,\mathbb{Z})$, $S^2=1$, the construction is algorithmic. Application is made in the Riemann surface setting.;math.RT
1801.03324;Homology groups of cubical sets;The paper is devoted to homology groups of cubical sets with coefficients in contravariant systems of Abelian groups. The study is based on the proof of the assertion that the homology groups of the category of cubes with coefficients in the diagram of Abelian groups are isomorphic to the homology groups of normalized complex of the cubical Abelian group corresponding to this diagram. The main result shows that the homology groups of a cubical set with coefficients in a contravariant system of Abelian groups are isomorphic to the values of left derived functors of the colimit functor on this contravariant system. This is used to obtain the isomorphism criterion for homology groups of cubical sets with coefficients in contravariant systems, and also to construct spectral sequences for the covering of a cubical set and for a morphism between cubical sets.;math.AT
1801.03332;Gaussian fluctuations for linear spectral statistics of Wigner beta ensembles;As an important topic in Mathematical Physics and statistics, random matrices theory has found uses in many aspects of modern physics and multivariate analysis. This paper is to investigate the Gaussian fluctuations for linear spectral statistics (LSS) of Wigner beta ensembles. We first establish a central limit theorem (CLT) for LSS of Wigner quaternion matrices, then give a general CLT for Wigner $\beta$ ensembles.;math.PR
1801.03336;BSDE formulation of combined regular and singular stochastic control problems;In this paper we study a class of combined regular and singular stochastic control problems that can be expressed as constrained BSDEs. In the Markovian case, this reduces to a characterization through a PDE with gradient constraint. But the BSDE formulation makes it possible to move beyond Markovian models and consider path-dependent problems. We also provide an approximation of the original control problem with standard BSDEs that yield a characterization of approximately optimal values and controls.;math.OC
1801.03337;Distribution of the absolute indicator of random Boolean functions;The absolute indicator is one of the measures used to determine the resistance offered by a Boolean function when used in the design of a symmetric cryptosystem. It was proposed along with the sum of square indicator to evaluate the quality of the diffusion property of block ciphers and hash functions. While the behaviour of the sum of square of random Boolean functions was already known, what remained was the study of the comportment of the absolute indicator of random Boolean functions. As an application, we show that the absolute indicator can distinguish a nonrandom binary sequence from a random one.;cs.IT
1801.03340;The critical 1-arm exponent for the ferromagnetic Ising model on the Bethe lattice;We consider the ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor Ising model on regular trees (Bethe lattice), which is well-known to undergo a phase transition in the absence of an external magnetic field. The behavior of the model at critical temperature can be described in terms of various critical exponents, one of them is the critical 1-arm exponent $\rho$, which characterizes the rate of decay of the (root) magnetization. The crucial quantity we analyze in this work is the thermal expectation of the root spin on a finite subtree, where the expected value is taken with respect to a probability measure related to the corresponding finite-volume Hamiltonian with a fixed boundary condition. The spontaneous magnetization, which is the limit of this thermal expectation in the distance between the root and the boundary (i.e. in the height of the subtree), is known to vanish at criticality. We are interested in a quantitative analysis of the rate of this convergence in terms of the critical 1-arm exponent $\rho$. Therefore, we rigorously prove that $\langle\sigma_0\rangle^+_n$, the thermal expectation of the root spin at the critical temperature and in the presence of the positive boundary condition, decays as $\langle\sigma_0\rangle^+_n\approx n^{-1/2}$ (in a rather sharp sense), where $n$ is the height of the tree. This establishes the 1-arm critical exponent for the Ising model on regular trees ($\rho=1/2$).;math.PR
1801.03341;Harder-Narasimhan filtrations for Breuil-Kisin-Fargues modules;We define and study Harder-Narasimhan filtrations on Breuil-Kisin-Fargues modules and related objects relevant to p-adic Hodge theory.;math.AG
1801.03343;Some remarks on the optimality of the Bruno-R{&#xfc,}ssmann condition;We prove that the Bruno-R{\"u}ssmann condition is optimal for the analytic preservation of a quasi-periodic invariant curve for an analytic twist map. The proof is based on Yoccoz's corresponding result for analytic circle diffeomorphisms and the uniqueness of invariant curves with a given irrational rotation number. We also prove a similar result for analytic Tonelli Hamiltonian flow with n = 2 degrees of freedom, for n $\ge$ 3 we only obtain a weaker result which recovers and slightly improves a theorem of Bessi.;math.DS
1801.03344;BV functions in Hilbert spaces;We study $BV$ functions in a Hilbert space $X$ endowed with a probability measure $\nu$, assuming that $\nu$ is Fomin differentiable along suitable directions. We establish basic characterizations, and we apply the general theory to relevant examples, including invariant measures of some stochastic PDEs.;math.FA
1801.03345;Optimal functional supervised classification with separation condition;We consider the binary supervised classification problem with the Gaussian functional model introduced in [7]. Taking advantage of the Gaussian structure, we design a natural plug-in classifier and derive a family of upper bounds on its worst-case excess risk over Sobolev spaces. These bounds are parametrized by a separation distance quantifying the difficulty of the problem, and are proved to be optimal (up to logarithmic factors) through matching minimax lower bounds. Using the recent works of [9] and [14] we also derive a logarithmic lower bound showing that the popular k-nearest neighbors classifier is far from optimality in this specific functional setting.;math.ST
1801.03346;Statistical Blockage Modeling and Robustness of Beamforming in Millimeter Wave Systems;There has been a growing interest in the commercialization of millimeter wave (mmW) technology as a part of the Fifth-Generation New Radio (5G-NR) wireless standardization efforts. In this direction, many sets of independent measurement campaigns show that wireless propagation at mmW carrier frequencies is only marginally worse than propagation at sub-6 GHz carrier frequencies for small-cell coverage --- one of the most important use-cases for 5G-NR. On the other hand, the biggest determinants of viability of mmW systems in practice are penetration and blockage of mmW signals through different materials in the scattering environment. With this background, the focus of this paper is on understanding the impact of blockage of mmW signals and reduced spatial coverage due to penetration through the human hand, body, vehicles, etc. Leveraging measurements with a 28 GHz mmW experimental prototype and electromagnetic simulation studies, we first propose statistical blockage models to capture the impact of the hand, human body and vehicles. We then study the time-scales at which mmW signals are disrupted by blockage (hand and human body). Our results show that these events can be attributed to physical movements and the time-scales corresponding to blockage are hence on the order of a few 100 ms or more. Building on this fundamental understanding, we finally consider the broader question of robustness of mmW beamforming to handle blockage. Network densification, subarray switching in a user equipment (UE) designed with multiple subarrays, fall back mechanisms such as codebook enhancements and switching to legacy carriers in non-standalone deployments, etc. can address blockage before it leads to a deleterious impact on the mmW link margin.;cs.IT
1801.03348;Side Disks of a Spherical Great Polygon;Take a circle and mark $n\in\mathbb{N}$ points on it designated as vertices. For any arc segment between two consecutive vertices which does not pass through any other vertex, there is a disk centered at its midpoint and has its end points on the boundary. We analyze intersection behaviour of these disks and show that the number of disjoint pairs among them is between $\frac{(n-2)(n-3)}{2}$ and $\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$ and their intersection graph is a subgraph of a triangulation of a convex $n$-gon.;math.CO
1801.03349;Mean-field backward stochastic differential equations and applications;In this paper we study the mean-field backward stochastic differential equations (mean-field bsde) of the form dY(t) =-f(t,Y(t),Z(t),K(t, . ),E[\varphi(Y(t),Z(t),K(t,.))])dt+Z(t)dB(t) +\int_{R_{0}}K(t,\zeta)\tilde{N}(dt,d\zeta), where B is a Brownian motion, \tilde{N} is the compensated Poisson random measure. <br />Under some mild conditions, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution triplet (Y,Z,K). It is commonly believed that there is no comparison theorem for general mean-field bsde. However, we prove a comparison theorem for a subclass of these equations. When the mean-field bsde is linear, we give an explicit formula for the first component Y(t) of the solution triplet. Our results are applied to solve a mean-field recursive utility optimization problem in finance.;math.OC
1801.03351;A triple comparison between anticipating stochastic integrals in financial modeling;We consider a simplified version of the problem of insider trading in a financial market. We approach it by means of anticipating stochastic calculus and compare the use of the Hitsuda-Skorokhod, the Ayed-Kuo, and the Russo-Vallois forward integrals within this context. Our results give some indication that, while the forward integral yields results with a suitable financial meaning, the Hitsuda-Skorokhod and the Ayed-Kuo integrals do not provide an appropriate formulation of this problem. Further results regarding the use of the Ayed-Kuo integral in this context are also provided, including the proof of the fact that the expectation of a Russo-Vallois solution is strictly greater than that of an Ayed-Kuo solution. Finally, we conjecture the explicit solution of an Ayed-Kuo stochastic differential equation that possesses discontinuous sample paths with finite probability.;math.PR
1801.03357;Singular equivalences of functor categories via Auslander-Buchweitz approximations;The aim of this paper is to construct singular equivalences between functor categories. As a special case, we show that there exists a singular equivalence arising from a cotilting module $T$, namely, the singularity category of $(^\perp T)/[T]$ and that of $(\mod A)/[T]$ are triangle equivalent. In particular, the canonical module $\omega$ over a commutative Noetherian ring induces a singular equivalence between $(\mathsf{CM}R)/[\omega]$ and $(\mod R)/[\omega]$, which generalizes Matsui-Takahashi's theorem. Our result is based on a sufficient condition for an additive category $\mathcal{A}$ and its subcategory $\mathcal{X}$ so that the canonical inclusion $\mathcal{X}\hookrightarrow\mathcal{A}$ induces a singular equivalence $\mathsf{D_{sg}}(\mathcal{A})\simeq \mathsf{D_{sg}}(\mathcal{X})$, which is a functor category version of Xiao-Wu Chen's theorem.;math.CT
1801.03359;Symbolic dynamics for one dimensional maps with nonuniform expansion;Given a piecewise $C^{1+\beta}$ map of the interval, possibly with critical points and discontinuities, we construct a symbolic model for invariant probability measures with nonuniform expansion that do not approach the critical points and discontinuities exponentially fast almost surely. More specifically, we code the lift of these measures in the natural extension of the map.;math.DS
1801.03360;On an Electro-Magneto-Elasto-Dynamic Transmission Problem;We consider a coupled system describing the interaction between acoustic and elastic regions, where the coupling occurs not via material properties but through an interaction on an interface separating the two regimes. Evolutionary well-posedness in the sense of Hadamard well-posedness supplemented by causal dependence is shown for a natural choice of generalized interface conditions. The results are obtained in a real Hilbert space setting incurring no regularity constraints on the boundary and almost none on the interface of the underlying regions.;math-ph
1801.03361;Regularity for evolution equations with non-autonomous perturbations in Banach spaces;We provide regularity of solutions to a large class of evolution equations on Banach spaces where the generator is composed of a static principal part plus a non-autonomous perturbation. Regularity is examined with respect to the graph norm of the iterations of the principal part. The results are applied to the Schr\"odinger equation and conditions on a time-dependent scalar potential for regularity of the solution in higher Sobolev spaces are derived.;math-ph
1801.03362;On an Elasto-Acoustic Transmission Problem in Anisotropic, Inhomogeneous Media;We consider a coupled system describing the interaction between acoustic and elastic regions, where the coupling occurs not via material properties but through an interaction on an interface separating the two regimes.

1801.03364;Mean-Field Delayed BSDEs with Jumps;We establish sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of mean-field backward stochastic differential equations with time delayed generator in the sense that at t, the generator may depend on previous values up to a delay constant {\delta} not on the hole past as in Delong and Imkeller [10], [13]. For sufficiently small delay constant {\delta} and for any finite time horizon, we get a unique solution.;math.OC

1801.03369;Johnson pseudo-Connes amenability of dual Banach algebras;We introduce the notion of Johnson pseudo-Connes amenability for dual Banach algebras. We study the relation between this new notion with the various notions of Connes amenability like Connes amenability, approximate Connes amenability and pseudo Connes amenability. We also investigate some hereditary properties of this new notion. We prove that for a locally compact group $G$, $M(G)$ is Johnson pseudo-Connes amenable if and only if $G$ is amenable. Also we show that for every non-empty set $I$, $\mathbb{M}_I(\mathbb{C})$ under this new notion is forced to have a finite index. Finally, we provide some examples of certain dual Banach algebras and we study their Johnson pseudo-Connes amenability.;math.FA
1801.03372;Localised modes due to defects in high contrast periodic media via two-scale homogenization;The spectral problem for an infinite periodic medium perturbed by a compact defect is considered. For a high contrast small $\ve$-size periodicity and a finite size defect we consider the critical $\ve^2$-scaling for the contrast. We employ (high contrast) two-scale homogenization for deriving asymptotically explicit limit equations for the localised modes (exponentially decaying eigenfunctions) and associated eigenvalues. Those are expressed in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a perturbed version of a two-scale limit operator introduced by V.V. Zhikov with an emergent explicit nonlinear dependence on the spectral parameter for the spectral problem at the macroscale. Using the method of asymptotic expansions supplemented by a high contrast boundary layer analysis we establish the existence of the actual eigenvalues near the eigenvalues of the limit operator, with %tight "$ \ve$ square root" error bounds. An example for circular or spherical defects in a periodic medium with isotropic homogenized properties is given and displays explicit limit eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Further results on improved error bounds for the eigenfunctions are discussed, by combining our results with those of M. Cherdantsev ({\it Mathematika. 2009,55:29--57}) based on the technique of strong two-scale resolvent convergence and associated two-scale compactness properties.;math.SP
1801.03374;$WAP$-biprojectivity of the enveloping dual Banach algebras;In this paper, we introduce a new notion of biprojectivity, called $WAP$-biprojectivity for $F(\mathcal{A})$, the enveloping dual Banach algebra associated to a Banach algebra $\mathcal{A}$. We find some relations between Connes biprojectivity, Connes amenability and this new notion. We show that, for a given dual Banach algebra $\mathcal{A}$, if $F(\mathcal{A})$ is Connes amenable, then $\mathcal{A}$ is Connes amenable. <br />For an infinite commutative compact group $G$, we show that the convolution Banach algebra $F(L^2(G))$ is not $WAP$-biprojective. Finally, we provide some examples of the enveloping dual Banach algebras and we study their $WAP$-biprojectivity and Connes amenability.;math.FA
1801.03377;A minimal PI cascade with $2^{\mathfrak{c}}$ minimal ideals;We first improve an old result of McMahon and show that a metric minimal flow whose enveloping semigroup contains less than $2^{\mathfrak{c}}$ (where ${\mathfrak{c}} ={2^{\aleph_0}}$) minimal left ideals is PI. Then we show the existence of various minimal PI flows with many minimal left ideals, as follows. For the acting group $G=SL_2(\mathbb{R})^\mathbb{N}$, we construct a metric minimal PI $G$-flow with $\mathfrak{c}$ minimal left ideals. We then use this example and results established in \cite{GW-79} to construct a metric minimal PI cascade $(X,T)$ with $\mathfrak{c}$ minimal left ideals. We go on and construct an example of a minimal PI-flow $(Y, \mathcal{G})$ on a compact manifold $Y$ and a suitable path-wise connected group $\mathcal{G}$ of homeomorphism of $Y$, such that the flow $(Y, \mathcal{G})$ is PI and has $2^{\mathfrak{c}}$ minimal left ideals. Finally, we use this latter example and a theorem of Dirb\'{a}k to construct a cascade $(X, T)$ which is PI (of order 3) and has $2^\mathfrak{c}$ minimal left ideals. Thus this final result shows that, even for cascades, the converse of the implication "less than $2^\mathfrak{c}$ minimal left ideals implies PI", fails.;math.DS
1801.03378;On Connes amenability of upper triangular matrix algebras;In this paper, we study the notion of Connes amenability for a class of $I\times{I}$-upper triangular matrix algebra $UP(I,\mathcal{A})$, where $\mathcal{A}$ is a dual Banach algebra with a non-zero $wk^\ast$-continuous character and $I$ is a totally ordered set. For this purpose, we characterize the $\phi$-Connes amenability of a dual Banach algebra $\mathcal{A}$ through the existence of a specified net in $\mathcal{A}\hat{\otimes}\mathcal{A}$, where $\phi$ is a non-zero $wk^\ast$-continuous character. Using this, we show that $UP(I,\mathcal{A})$ is Connes amenable if and only if $I$ is singleton and $\mathcal{A}$ is Connes amenable. In addition, some examples of $\phi$-Connes amenable dual Banach algebras, which is not Connes amenable are given.;math.FA
1801.03379;On Maximally Recoverable Codes for Product Topologies;Given a topology of local parity-check constraints, a maximally recoverable code (MRC) can correct all erasure patterns that are information-theoretically correctable. In a grid-like topology, there are $a$ local constraints in every column forming a column code, $b$ local constraints in every row forming a row code, and $h$ global constraints in an $(m \times n)$ grid of codeword. Recently, Gopalan et al. initiated the study of MRCs under grid-like topology, and derived a necessary and sufficient condition, termed as the regularity condition, for an erasure pattern to be recoverable when $a=1, h=0$. <br />In this paper, we consider MRCs for product topology ($h=0$). First, we construct a certain bipartite graph based on the erasure pattern satisfying the regularity condition for product topology (any $a, b$, $h=0$) and show that there exists a complete matching in this graph. We then present an alternate direct proof of the sufficient condition when $a=1, h=0$. We later extend our technique to study the topology for $a=2, h=0$, and characterize a subset of recoverable erasure patterns in that case. For both $a=1, 2$, our method of proof is uniform, i.e., by constructing tensor product $G_{\text{col}} \otimes G_{\text{row}}$ of generator matrices of column and row codes such that certain square sub-matrices retain full rank. The full-rank condition is proved by resorting to the matching identified earlier and also another set of matchings in erasure sub-patterns.;cs.IT
1801.03381;Recovery of Binary Sparse Signals with Biased Measurement Matrices;This work treats the recovery of sparse, binary signals through box-constrained basis pursuit using biased measurement matrices. Using a probabilistic model, we provide conditions under which the recovery of both sparse and saturated binary signals is very likely. In fact, we also show that under the same condition, the solution of the boxed-constrained basis pursuit program can be found using boxed-constrained least-squares.;math.NA
1801.03383;Games for eigenvalues of the Hessian and concave/convex envelopes;We study the PDE $\lambda_j(D^2 u) = 0$, in $\Omega$, with $u=g$, on $\partial \Omega$. Here $\lambda_1(D^2 u) \leq ... \leq \lambda_N (D^2 u)$ are the ordered eigenvalues of the Hessian $D^2 u$. First, we show a geometric interpretation of the viscosity solutions to the problem in terms of convex/concave envelopes over affine spaces of dimension $j$. In one of our main results, we give necessary and sufficient conditions on the domain so that the problem has a continuous solution for every continuous datum $g$. Next, we introduce a two-player zero-sum game whose values approximate solutions to this PDE problem. In addition, we show an asymptotic mean value characterization for the solution the the PDE.;math.AP
1801.03386;Asymptotics of the density of parabolic Anderson random fields;We investigate the sharp density $\rho(t,x, y)$ of the solution $u(t,x)$ to stochastic partial differential equation $\frac{\partial }{\partial t} u(t,x)=\frac12 \Delta u(t,x)+u\diamond \dot W(t,x)$, where $\dot W$ is a general Gaussian noise and $\diamond$ denotes the Wick product. We mainly concern with the asymptotic behavior of $\rho(t,x, y)$ when $y\rightarrow \infty$ or when $t\to0+$. Both upper and lower bounds are obtained and these two bounds match each other modulo some multiplicative constants. If the initial datum is positive, then $\rho(t,x,y)$ is supported on the positive half line $y\in [0, \infty)$ and in this case we show that $\rho(t,x, 0+)=0$ and obtain an upper bound for $\rho(t,x, y)$ when $y\rightarrow 0+$.;math.PR

1801.03402;Modelling wave propagation without sampling restrictions using the multiplicative calculus I: Theoretical considerations;The multiplicative (or geometric) calculus is a non-Newtonian calculus derived from an arithmetic in which the operations of addition/subtraction/multiplication are replaced by multiplication/division/exponentiation. A major difference between the multiplicative calculus and the classical additive calculus, and one that has important consequences in the simulation of wave propagation problems, is that in geometric calculus the role of polynomials is played by exponentials of a polynomial argument. For example, whereas a polynomial of degree one has constant (classical) derivative, it is the exponential function that has constant derivative in the multiplicative calculus. As we will show, this implies that even low-order finite quotient approximations|the analogues of finite differences in the multiplicative calculus|produce exact multiplicative derivatives of exponential functions. We exploit this fact to show that some partial differential equations (PDE) can be solved far more efficiently using techniques based on the multiplicative calculus. For wave propagation models in particular, we will show that it is possible to circumvent the minimum-points-per-wavelength sampling constraints of classical methods. In this first part we develop the theoretical framework for studying multiplicative partial differential equations and their connections with classical models.;math.NA

1801.03410;Noncommutative Euclidean spaces;We give a definition of noncommutative finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces $\mathbb R^n$. We then remind our definition of noncommutative products of Euclidean spaces $\mathbb R^{N_1}$ and $\mathbb R^{N_2}$ which produces noncommutative Euclidean spaces $\mathbb R^{N_1+N_2}$. We solve completely the conditions defining the noncommutative products of the Euclidean spaces $\mathbb R^{N_1}$ and $\mathbb R^{N_2}$ and prove that the corresponding noncommutative unit spheres $S^{N_1+N_2-1}$ are noncommutative spherical manifolds. We then apply these concepts to define "noncommutative" quaternionic planes and noncommutative quaternionic tori on which acts the classical quaternionic torus $T^2_{\mathbb H}=U_1(\mathbb H)\times U_1(\mathbb H)$;math.QA
1801.03413;Characterizing subclasses of cover-incomparability graphs by forbidden subposets;In this paper we continue investigations of cover-incomparability graphs of finite partially ordered sets (see \cite{Bres,Bres2,Bres3,Bres4} and \cite{Max,MaxDH}). We consider in some detail the distinction between cover-preserving subsets and isometric subsets of a partially ordered set. This is critical to understanding why forbidden subposet characterizations of certain classes of cover-incomparability graphs in \cite{Bres} and \cite{Bres3} are not valid as presented. Here we provide examples, investigate the root of the difficulties, and formulate and prove valid revisions of these characterizations.;math.CO
1801.03414;On neoclassical Schottky groups;The goal of this paper is to describe a theoretical construction of an infinite collection of non-classical Schottky groups. We first show that there are infinitely many non-classical noded Schottky groups on the boundary of Schottky space, and we show that infinitely many of these are "sufficiently complicated". We then show that every Schottky group in an appropriately defined relative conical neighborhood of any sufficiently complicated noded Schottky group is necessarily non-classical. Finally, we construct two examples, the first is a noded Riemann surface of genus $3$ that cannot be uniformized by any neoclassical Schottky group (i.e., classical noded Schottky group), the second is an explicit example of a sufficiently complicated noded Schottky group in genus $3$.;math.GT
1801.03422;Age of Information: Whittle Index for Scheduling Stochastic Arrivals;Age of information is a new concept that characterizes the freshness of information at end devices. This paper studies the age of information from a scheduling perspective. We consider a wireless broadcast network where a base-station updates many users on stochastic information arrivals. Suppose that only one user can be updated for each time. In this context, we aim at developing a transmission scheduling algorithm for minimizing the long-run average age. To develop a low-complexity transmission scheduling algorithm, we apply the Whittle's framework for restless bandits. We successfully derive the Whittle index in a closed form and establish the indexability. Based on the Whittle index, we propose a scheduling algorithm, while experimentally showing that it closely approximates an age-optimal scheduling algorithm.;math.OC
1801.03427;Nonautonomous Conley Index Theory: The Connecting Homomorphism;Attractor-repeller decompositions of isolated invariant sets give rise to so-called connecting homomorphisms. These homomorphisms reveal information on the existence and structure of connecting trajectories of the underlying dynamical system. <br />To give a meaningful generalization of this general principle to nonautonomous problems, the nonautonomous homology Conley index is expressed as a direct limit. Moreover, it is shown that a nontrivial connecting homomorphism implies, on the dynamical systems level, a sort of uniform connectedness of the attractor-repeller decomposition.;math.DS
1801.03432;On the determinants and permanents of matrices with restricted entries over prime fields;Let $A$ be a set in a prime field $\mathbb{F}_p$. In this paper, we prove that $d\times d$ matrices with entries in $A$ determine almost $|A|^{3+\frac{1}{45}}$ distinct determinants and almost $|A|^{2-\frac{1}{6}}$ distinct permanents when $|A|$ is small enough.;math.CO
1801.03433;Integrability of $\mathcal W({\mathfrak{sl}_d})$-symmetric Toda conformal field theories I : Quantum geometry;In this article which is the first of a series of three, we consider $\mathcal W({\mathfrak{sl}_d})$-symmetric conformal field theory in topological regimes for a generic value of the background charge, where $\mathcal W({\mathfrak{sl}_d})$ is the W-algebra associated to the affine Lie algebra $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_d}$, whose vertex operator algebra is included to that of the affine Lie algebra $\widehat{\mathfrak g}_1$ at level 1. In such regimes, the theory admits a free field representation. We show that the generalized Ward identities assumed to be satisfied by chiral conformal blocks with current insertions can be solved perturbatively in topological regimes. This resolution uses a generalization of the topological recursion to non-commutative, or quantum, spectral curves. In turn, special geometry arguments yields a conjecture for the perturbative reconstruction of a particular chiral block.;math-ph
1801.03444;The Dirichlet problem for singular elliptic equations with general nonlinearities;In this paper, under very general assumptions, we prove existence and regularity of distributional solutions to homogeneous Dirichlet problems of the form $$\begin{cases} \displaystyle - \Delta_{1} u = h(u)f &amp, \text{in}\, \Omega,\newline u\geq 0&amp, \text{in}\ \Omega, \newline u=0 &amp, \text{on}\ \partial \Omega, \end{cases} $$ where, $\Delta_{1} $ is the $1$-laplace operator, $\Omega$ is a bounded open subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$ with Lipschitz boundary, $h(s)$ is a continuous function which may become singular at $s=0^{+}$, and $f$ is a nonnegative datum in $L^{N,\infty}(\Omega)$ with suitable small norm. Uniqueness of solutions is also shown provided $h$ is decreasing and $f&gt,0$. As a by-product of our method a general theory for the same problem involving the $p$-laplacian as principal part, which is missed in the literature, is established. The main assumptions we use are also further discussed in order to show their optimality.;math.AP
1801.03447;Elliptic 1-Laplacian Equations with Dynamical Boundary Conditions;This paper is concerned with an evolution problem having an elliptic equation involving the 1-Laplacian operator and a dynamical boundary condition. We apply nonlinear semigroup theory to obtain existence and uniqueness results as well as a comparison principle. Our main theorem shows that the solution we found is actually a strong solution. We also compare solutions with different data.;math.AP
1801.03450;A new generalization of Browder degree;A new generalization of the Browder's degree for the mappings of the type $(S)_+$ is presented. The main idea is rooted in the observation that the Browder's degree remains unchanged for the mappings of the form $A: Y\to X^*$, where $Y$ is a reflexive uniformly convex Banach space continuously embedded in the Banach space $X$. The advantage of the suggested degree lies in the simplicity it provides for the calculations of the degree associated with nonlinear operators. An application from the theory of phase transition in liquid crystals is presented for which the suggested degree has been successfully applied.;math.AP
1801.03457;A class of $L_1$-to-$L_1$ and $L_\infty$-to-$L_\infty$ interval observers for (delayed) Markov jump linear systems;We exploit recent results on the stability and performance analysis of positive Markov jump linear systems (MJLS) for the design of interval observers for MJLS with and without delays. While the conditions for the $L_1$ performance are necessary and sufficient, those for the $L_\infty$ performance are only sufficient. All the conditions are stated as linear programs that can be solved very efficiently. Two examples are given for illustration.;math.OC
1801.03464;Stability analysis and state-feedback control of LPV systems with piecewise constant parameters subject to spontaneous Poissonian jumps;LPV systems with piecewise constant parameters subject to spontaneous Poissonian jumps are a class of systems that does not seem to have been thoroughly considered in the literature. We partially fill this gap here by providing sufficient stability and performance analysis conditions stated in terms of infinite-dimensional LMI problems that can be solved using sum of squares programming. A particularity of the obtained conditions lies in the presence of an integral term leading to some technical difficulties when attempting to obtain convex conditions for the design of a gain-scheduled state-feedback controller. This difficulty is circumvented by relying on a recent result for time-delay systems analysis and an equivalent integral-free LMI condition is obtained. The approach is illustrated through several examples.;math.OC
1801.03465;Reducible characteristic cycles of Harish-Chandra modules for $\mathrm{U}(p,q)$ and the Kashiwara-Saito singularity;We give examples of reducible characteristic cycles for irreducible Harish-Chandra modules for $\mathrm{U}(p,q)$ by analyzing a four-dimensional singular subvariety of $\mathbb{C}^8$. We relate this singularity to the Kashiwara-Saito singularity arising for Schubert varieties for ${\mathrm{GL}}(8,\mathbb{C})$ with reducible characteristic cycles, as well as recent related examples of Williamson. In particular, this gives another explanation of the simple highest weight modules for ${\mathfrak{g}}{\mathfrak{l}}(12,\mathbb{C})$ with reducible associated varieties that Williamson discovered.;math.RT
1801.03467;Infinity-operads and Day convolution in Goodwillie calculus;We prove two theorems about Goodwillie calculus and use those theorems to describe new models for Goodwillie derivatives of functors between pointed compactly-generated infinity-categories. The first theorem say that the construction of higher derivatives for spectrum-valued functors is a Day convolution of copies of the first derivative construction. The second theorem says that the derivatives of any functor can be realized as natural transformation objects for derivatives of spectrum-valued functors. Together these results allow us to construct an infinity-operad that models the derivatives of the identity functor on any pointed compactly-generated infinity-category. <br />Our main example is the infinity-category of algebras over a stable infinity-operad, in which case we show that the derivatives of the identity essentially recover the same infinity-operad, making precise a well-known slogan in Goodwillie calculus. <br />We also describe a bimodule structure on the derivatives of an arbitrary functor, over the infinity-operads given by the derivatives of the identity on the source and target, and we conjecture a chain rule that generalizes previous work of Arone and the author in the case of functors of pointed spaces and spectra.;math.AT
1801.03472;Orbifolds from a metric viewpoint;We characterize Riemannian orbifolds and their coverings in terms of metric geometry. In particular, we show that the metric double of a Riemannian orbifold along the closure of its codimension one stratum is a Riemannian orbifold and that the natural projection is an orbifold covering.;math.DG
1801.03473;Strong existence and uniqueness for stable stochastic differential equations with distributional drift;We consider the stochastic differential equation $$ dX_t = b(X_t) dt + dL_t,$$ where the drift $b$ is a generalized function and $L$ is a symmetric one dimensional $\alpha$-stable L\'evy processes, $\alpha \in (1, 2)$. We define the notion of solution to this equation and establish strong existence and uniqueness whenever $b$ belongs to the Besov--H\"{o}lder space $\mathcal{C}^\beta$ for $\beta &gt,1/2-\alpha/2$.;math.PR
1801.03475;Supercritical degenerate parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel system -- existence criterion given by the best constant in Sobolev&#x27,s inequality;This article presents a relationship between the sharp constant of the Sobolev inequality and the initial criterion to the global existence of degenerate parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel system with the diffusion exponent $\frac{2n}{2+n}&lt,m&lt,2-\frac{2}{n}$. The global weak solution obtained in this article does not need any smallness assumption on the initial data. Furthermore, a uniform in time $L^{\infty}$ estimate of the weak solutions is obtained via the Moser iteration, where the constant in $L^p$ estimate for the gradient of the chemical concentration has been exactly formulated in order to complete the iteration process.;math.AP
1801.03480;Smooth Version of Johnson&#x27,s Problem Concerning Derivations of Group Algebras;A description of the algebra of outer derivations of a group algebra of a finitely presented discrete group is given in terms of the Cayley complex of the groupoid of the adjoint action of the group. This task is a smooth version of Johnson's problem concerning the derivations of a group algebra. It is shown that the algebra of outer derivations is isomorphic to the group of the one-dimensional cohomology with compact supports of the Cayley complex over the field of complex numbers.;math.AT
1801.03481;Latent Factor Analysis of Gaussian Distributions under Graphical Constraints;In this paper, we explore the algebraic structures of solution spaces for Gaussian latent factor analysis when the population covariance matrix $\Sigma_x$ has an additional latent graphical constraint, namely, a latent star topology. In particular, we give sufficient and necessary conditions under which the solutions to constrained minimum trace factor analysis (CMTFA) is still star. We further show that the solution to CMTFA under the star constraint can only have two cases, i.e. the number of latent variable can be only one (star) or $n-1$ where $n$ is the dimension of the observable vector, and characterize the solution for both the cases.;cs.IT
1801.03482;Cohomological Hall algebra of Higgs sheaves on a curve;We define the cohomological Hall algebra ${AHA}_{Higgs(X)}$ of the ($2$-dimensional) Calabi-Yau category of Higgs sheaves on a smooth projective curve $X$, as well as its nilpotent and semistable variants, in the context of an arbitrary oriented Borel-Moore homology theory. In the case of usual Borel-Moore homology, ${AHA}_{Higgs(X)}$ is a module over the (universal) cohomology ring $\mathbb{H}$ of the stacks of coherent sheaves on $X$ . We show that it is a torsion-free $\mathbb{H}$-module, and we provide an explicit collection of generators (the collection of fundamental classes $[Coh_{r,d}]$ of the zero-sections of the map $Higgs_{r,d} \to Coh_{r,d}$, for $r \geq 0, d \in Z$).;math.AG
1801.03491;Note on the absence of remainders in the Wiener-Ikehara theorem;We show that it is impossible to get a better remainder than the classical one in the Wiener-Ikehara theorem even if one assumes analytic continuation of the Mellin transform after subtraction of the pole to a half-plane. We also prove a similar result for the Ingham-Karamata theorem.;math.CA
1801.03494;Secure Retrospective Interference Alignment;In this paper, the $K$-user interference channel with secrecy constraints is considered with delayed channel state information at transmitters (CSIT). We propose a novel secure retrospective interference alignment scheme in which the transmitters carefully mix information symbols with artificial noises to ensure confidentiality. Achieving positive secure degrees of freedom (SDoF) is challenging due to the delayed nature of CSIT, and the distributed nature of the transmitters. Our scheme works over two phases: phase one in which each transmitter sends information symbols mixed with artificial noises, and repeats such transmission over multiple rounds. In the next phase, each transmitter uses delayed CSIT of the previous phase and sends a function of the net interference and artificial noises (generated in previous phase), which is simultaneously useful for all receivers. These phases are designed to ensure the decodability of the desired messages while satisfying the secrecy constraints. We present our achievable scheme for three models, namely: 1) $K$-user interference channel with confidential messages (IC-CM), and we show that $\frac{1}{2} (\sqrt{K} -6) $ SDoF is achievable, 2) $K$-user interference channel with an external eavesdropper (IC-EE), and 3) $K$-user IC with confidential messages and an external eavesdropper (IC-CM-EE). We show that for the $K$-user IC-EE, $\frac{1}{2} (\sqrt{K} -3) $ SDoF is achievable, and for the $K$-user IC-CM-EE, $\frac{1}{2} (\sqrt{K} -6) $ is achievable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on the $K$-user interference channel with secrecy constrained models and delayed CSIT that achieves a SDoF which scales with $K$, the number of users.;cs.IT
1801.03516;Parseval&#x27,s Identity and Optimal Transport Maps;Recent findings for optimal transport maps between distribution functions sharing the same copula show that componentwise the solution is the optimal map between marginal distributions. This is an important discovery since in the multivariate setting optimal maps are difficult to find and only known in a few special cases. In this paper, we extend the result on common copulas by showing that orthonormal transformations of variables sharing a common copula also have a known optimal map. We illustrate this by establishing optimal maps between members of a class of scale mixture of normal distributions.;math.PR
1801.03520;Communication-Constrained Expansion Planning for Resilient Distribution Systems;Distributed generation and remotely controlled switches have emerged as important technologies to improve the resiliency of distribution grids against extreme weather-related disturbances. Therefore it becomes impor- tant to study how best to place them on the grid in order to meet a resiliency criteria, while minimizing costs and capturing their dependencies on the associated communication systems that sustains their distributed operations. This paper introduces the Optimal Resilient Design Problem for Distribution and Communi- cation Systems (ORDPDC) to address this need. The ORDPDC is formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer program that captures the physical laws of distribution systems, the communication connec- tivity of the smart grid components, and a set of scenarios which specifies which components are affected by potential disasters. The paper proposes an exact branch-and-price algorithm for the ORDPDC which features a strong lower bound and a variety of acceleration schemes to address degeneracy. The ORDPDC model and branch-and-price algorithm were evaluated on a variety of test cases with varying disaster inten- sities and network topologies. The results demonstrate the significant impact of the network topologies on the expansion plans and costs, as well as the computational benefits of the proposed approach.;math.OC
1801.03527;Multiplication of Distributions and Nonperturbative Calculations of Transition Probabilities;In a mathematical context in which one can multiply distributions the "`formal"' nonperturbative canonical Hamiltonian formalism in Quantum Field Theory makes sense mathematically, which can be understood a priori from the fact the so called "`infinite quantities"' make sense unambiguously (but are not classical real numbers). The perturbation series does not make sense. A novelty appears when one starts to compute the transition probabilities. The transition probabilities have to be computed in a nonperturbative way which, at least in simplified mathematical examples (even those looking like nonrenormalizable series), gives real values between 0 and 1 capable to represent probabilities. However these calculations should be done numerically and we have only been able to compute simplified mathematical examples due to the fact these calculations appear very demanding in the physically significant situation with an infinite dimensional Fock space and the QFT operators.;math-ph
1801.03536;On B. Moss&#xe9,&#x27,s unilateral recognizability theorem;We complete statement and proof for B. Moss\'e's unilateral recognizability theorem. We also provide an algorithm for deciding the unilateral non-recognizability of a given primitive substitution.;math.DS
1801.03538;On Monotonous Separately Continuous Functions;Let ${\mathbb T}=({\bf T},\leq)$ and ${\mathbb T}_{1}=({\bf T}_{1},\leq_{1})$ be linearly ordered sets and $\mathscr{X}$ be a topological space. The main result of the paper is the following: <br />If function $\boldsymbol{f}(t,x):{\bf T}\times\mathscr{X}\mapsto{\bf T}_{1}$ is continuous in each variable ("$t$"and "$x$") separately and function $\boldsymbol{f}_{x}(t)=\boldsymbol{f}(t,x)$ is monotonous on ${\bf T}$ for every $x\in\mathscr{X}$, then $\boldsymbol{f}$ is continuous mapping from ${\bf T}\times\mathscr{X}$ to ${\bf T}_{1}$, where ${\bf T}$ and ${\bf T}_{1}$ are considered as topological spaces under the order topology and ${\bf T}\times\mathscr{X}$ is considered as topological space under the Tychonoff topology on the Cartesian product of topological spaces ${\bf T}$ and $\mathscr{X}$.;math.GM
1801.03543;Quantum current algebras associated with rational $R$-matrix;We study quantum current algebra $\textrm{A}(\overline{R})$ associated with the rational $R$-matrix of $\mathfrak{gl}_N$ and we give explicit formulae for the elements of its center at the critical level. Due to Etingof--Kazhdan's construction, the level $c$ vacuum module $\mathcal{V}_c(\overline{R})$ for the algebra $\textrm{A}(\overline{R})$ possesses a quantum vertex algebra structure for any complex number $c$. We prove that any module for the quantum vertex algebra $\mathcal{V}_c(\overline{R})$ is naturally equipped with a structure of restricted $\textrm{A}(\overline{R})$-module of level $c$ and vice versa.;math.QA
1801.03548;On strong $L^2$ convergence of time numerical schemes for the stochastic 2D Navier-Stokes equations;We prove that some discretization schemes for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations subject to a random perturbation converge in $L^2(\Omega)$. This refines previous results which only established the convergence in probability of these numerical approximations. Using exponential moment estimates of the solution of the stochastic NS equations and convergence of a localized scheme, we can prove strong convergence of fully implicit and semi-implicit time Euler discretizations, and of a splitting scheme. The speed of the $L^2(\Omega)$-convergence depends on the diffusion coefficient and on the viscosity parameter.;math.PR
1801.03549;$E_{2}$ Structures and Derived Koszul Duality in String Topology;We construct an equivalence of $E_{2}$ algebras between two models for the Thom spectrum of the free loop space that are related by derived Koszul duality. To do this, we describe the functoriality and invariance properties of topological Hochschild cohomology.;math.AT
1801.03553;On the Noise-Information Separation of a Private Principal Component Analysis Scheme;In a survey disclosure model, we consider an additive noise privacy mechanism and study the trade-off between privacy guarantees and statistical utility. Privacy is approached from two different but complementary viewpoints: information and estimation theoretic. Motivated by the performance of principal component analysis, statistical utility is measured via the spectral gap of a certain covariance matrix. This formulation and its motivation rely on classical results from random matrix theory. We prove some properties of this statistical utility function and discuss a simple numerical method to evaluate it.;cs.IT
1801.03557;Rate Selection and Power Adaptation using Maximal Ratio Combining for the Random Access Gaussian Channel;With the emergence of machine-driven communi- cation, there is a renewed interest in the design of random multiple access schemes for networks with large number of active devices. Many of the recently proposed access paradigms are enhancements to slotted ALOHA. One of the popular schemes, irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA), is based on an analogy between multiple access with successive interference cancellation and message-passing decoding on bipartite graphs. Most of the results on IRSA and its variants focus on the collision channel and they ignore physical limitations such as transmit power constraints and additive Gaussian noise at the physical layer. As such, naive extensions of IRSA to the Gaussian multiple access channel are not power efficient in the low signal-to-noise- ratio regime. This work introduces a novel paradigm whereby devices adapt their rates and/or transmit powers based on their chosen repetition profiles. The receiver performs maximal ratio combining over all the replicas prior to decoding a message. Numerical results for finite number of users show that the proposed scheme can provide substantial improvements in terms of power efficiency and average rate over standard IRSA.;cs.IT
1801.03572;Learning Aided Optimization for Energy Harvesting Devices with Outdated State Information;This paper considers utility optimal power control for energy harvesting wireless devices with a finite capacity battery. The distribution information of the underlying wireless environment and harvestable energy is unknown and only outdated system state information is known at the device controller. This scenario shares similarity with Lyapunov opportunistic optimization and online learning but is different from both. By a novel combination of Zinkevich's online gradient learning technique and the drift-plus-penalty technique from Lyapunov opportunistic optimization, this paper proposes a learning-aided algorithm that achieves utility within $O(\epsilon)$ of the optimal, for any desired $\epsilon&gt,0$, by using a battery with an $O(1/\epsilon)$ capacity. The proposed algorithm has low complexity and makes power investment decisions based on system history, without requiring knowledge of the system state or its probability distribution.;math.OC
1801.03573;Hyperbolic systems with non-diagonalisable principal part and variable multiplicities, I. Well-posedness;In this paper we analyse the well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for a rather general class of hyperbolic systems with space-time dependent coefficients and with multiple characteristics of variable multiplicity. First, we establish a well-posedness result in anisotropic Sobolev spaces for systems with upper triangular principal part under interesting natural conditions on the orders of lower order terms below the diagonal. Namely, the terms below the diagonal at a distance $k$ to it must be of order $-k$. This setting also allows for the Jordan block structure in the system. Second, we give conditions for the Schur type triangularisation of general systems with variable coefficients for reducing them to the form with an upper triangular principal part for which the first result can be applied. We give explicit details for the appearing conditions and constructions for $2\times 2$ and $3\times 3$ systems, complemented by several examples.;math.AP
1801.03575;The Structure of the Three-Dimensional Special Linear Group over a Local Field;For K a local field, it is shown that SL3(K) acts on a simply connected two dimensional simplicial complex in which a single face serves as a fundamental domain. From this it follows that SL3(K) is the generalized amalgamated product of three subgroups. Specifically if K is the field of fractions of the discrete valuation ring O, then SL3(K) is the amalgamation of three subgroups isomorphic to SL3(O) along pairwise intersections. This generalizes a theorem of Ihara, which gives the structure of SL2(K) as the amalgamated product of two groups in analogous fashion.;math.GR
1801.03576;Analyticity of dissipative-dispersive systems in higher dimensions;We investigate the analyticity of the attractors of a class of Kuramoto-Sivashinsky type pseudo-differential equations in higher dimensions, which are periodic in all spatial variables and possess a universal attractor. This is done by fine-tuning the techniques used in a previous work of the second author, which are based on an analytic extensibility criterion involving the growth of $\nabla^n u$, as $n$ tends to infinity (here $u$ is the solution). These techniques can now be utilised in a variety of higher dimensional equations possessing universal attractors, including Topper--Kawahara equation, Frenkel--Indireshkumar equations and their dispersively modified analogs. We prove that the solutions are analytic whenever $\gamma$, the order of dissipation of the pseudo-differential operator, is higher than one. We believe that this estimate is optimal, based on numerical evidence.;math.AP
1801.03591;Characterization and Approximation of Strong General Dual Feasible Functions;Dual feasible functions (DFFs) have been used to provide bounds for standard packing problems and valid inequalities for integer optimization problems. In this paper, the connection between general DFFs and a particular family of cut-generating functions is explored. We find the characterization of (restricted/strongly) maximal general DFFs and prove a 2-slope theorem for extreme general DFFs. We show that any restricted maximal general DFF can be well approximated by an extreme general DFF.;math.OC
1801.03592;Estimation of the Robin coefficient field in a Poisson problem with uncertain conductivity field;We consider the reconstruction of a heterogeneous coefficient field in a Robin boundary condition on an inaccessible part of the boundary in a Poisson problem with an uncertain (or unknown) inhomogeneous conductivity field in the interior of the domain. To account for model errors that stem from the uncertainty in the conductivity coefficient, we treat the unknown conductivity as a nuisance parameter and carry out approximative premarginalization over it, and invert for the Robin coefficient field only. We approximate the related modelling errors via the Bayesian approximation error (BAE) approach. The uncertainty analysis presented here relies on a local linearization of the parameter-to-observable map at the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates, which leads to a normal (Gaussian) approximation of the parameter posterior density. To compute the MAP point we apply an inexact Newton conjugate gradient approach based on the adjoint methodology. The construction of the covariance is made tractable by invoking a low-rank approximation of the data misfit component of the Hessian. Two numerical experiments are considered: one where the prior covariance on the conductivity is isotropic, and one where the prior covariance on the conductivity is anisotropic. Results are compared to those based on standard error models, with particular emphasis on the feasibility of the posterior uncertainty estimates. We show that the BAE approach is a feasible one in the sense that the predicted posterior uncertainty is consistent with the actual estimation errors, while neglecting the related modelling error yields infeasible estimates for the Robin coefficient. In addition, we demonstrate that the BAE approach is approximately as computationally expensive (measured in the number of PDE solves) as the conventional error approach.;math.OC
1801.03594;Finite Blocklength and Dispersion Bounds for the Arbitrarily-Varying Channel;Finite blocklength and second-order (dispersion) results are presented for the arbitrarily-varying channel (AVC), a classical model wherein an adversary can transmit arbitrary signals into the channel. A novel finite blocklength achievability bound is presented, roughly analogous to the random coding union bound for non-adversarial channels. This finite blocklength bound, along with a known converse bound, is used to derive bounds on the dispersion of discrete memoryless AVCs without shared randomness, and with cost constraints on the input and the state. These bounds are tight for many channels of interest, including the binary symmetric AVC. However, the bounds are not tight if the deterministic and random code capacities differ.;cs.IT
1801.03595;Efficient Local Map Search Algorithms for the Placement of Flying Relays;This paper studies the optimal unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) placement problem for wireless networking. The UAV operates as a flying wireless relay to provide coverage extension for a base station (BS) and deliver capacity boost to a user shadowed by obstacles. While existing methods rely on statistical models for potential blockage of a direct propagation link, we propose an approach capable of leveraging local terrain information to offer performance guarantees. The proposed method allows to strike the best trade-off between minimizing propagation distances to ground terminals and discovering good propagation conditions. The algorithm only requires several propagation parameters, but it is capable to avoid deep propagation shadowing and is proven to find the globally optimal UAV position. Only a local exploration over the target area is required, and the maximum length of search trajectory is linear to the geographical scale. Hence, it lends itself to online search. Significant throughput gains are found when compared to other positioning approaches based on statistical propagation models.;cs.IT
1801.03599;On the signed Euler characteristic property for subvarieties of abelian varieties;We give an elementary proof of the fact that a pure-dimensional closed subvariety of a complex abelian variety has a signed intersection homology Euler characteristic. We also show that such subvarieties which, moreover, are local complete intersections, have a signed Euler-Poincare characteristic. Our arguments rely on the construction of circle-valued Morse functions on such spaces, and use in an essential way the stratified Morse theory of Goresky-MacPherson. Our approach also applies (with only minor modifications) for proving similar statements in the analytic context, i.e., for subvarieties of compact complex tori. Alternative proofs of our results can be given by using the general theory of perverse sheaves.;math.AT
1801.03600;Multi-Level Stochastic Gradient Methods for Nested Composition Optimization;Stochastic gradient methods are scalable for solving large-scale optimization problems that involve empirical expectations of loss functions. Existing results mainly apply to optimization problems where the objectives are one- or two-level expectations. In this paper, we consider the multi-level compositional optimization problem that involves compositions of multi-level component functions and nested expectations over a random path. It finds applications in risk-averse optimization and sequential planning. We propose a class of multi-level stochastic gradient methods that are motivated from the method of multi-timescale stochastic approximation. First we propose a basic $T$-level stochastic compositional gradient algorithm, establish its almost sure convergence and obtain an $n$-iteration error bound $O (n^{-1/2^T})$. Then we develop accelerated multi-level stochastic gradient methods by using an extrapolation-interpolation scheme to take advantage of the smoothness of individual component functions. When all component functions are smooth, we show that the convergence rate improves to $O(n^{-4/(7+T)})$ for general objectives and $O (n^{-4/(3+T)})$ for strongly convex objectives. We also provide almost sure convergence and rate of convergence results for nonconvex problems. The proposed methods and theoretical results are validated using numerical experiments.;math.OC
1801.03602;Closed formulas for exponential sums of symmetric polynomials over Galois fields;Exponential sums have applications to a variety of scientific fields, including, but not limited to, cryptography, coding theory and information theory. Closed formulas for exponential sums of symmetric Boolean functions were found by Cai, Green and Thierauf in the late 1990's. Their closed formulas imply that these exponential sums are linear recursive. The linear recursivity of these sums has been exploited in numerous papers and has been used to compute the asymptotic behavior of such sequences. In this article, we extend the result of Cai, Green and Thierauf, that is, we find closed formulas for exponential sums of symmetric polynomials over any Galois fields. Our result also implies that the recursive nature of these sequences is not unique to the binary field, as they are also linear recursive over any finite field. In fact, we provide explicit linear recurrences with integer coefficients for such sequences. As a byproduct of our results, we discover a link between exponential sums of symmetric polynomials over Galois fields and a problem for multinomial coefficients which similar to the problem of bisecting binomial coefficients.;math.CO
1801.03607;Quadrature compressive sampling SAR imaging;This paper presents a quadrature compressive sampling (QuadCS) and associated fast imaging scheme for synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Different from other analog-to-information conversions (AIC), QuadCS AICs using independent spreading signals sample the SAR echoes due to different transmitted pulses. Then the resulting sensing matrix has lower correlation between any two columns than that by a fixed spreading signal, and better SAR image can be reconstructed. With proper setting of the spreading signals in QuadCS, the sensing matrix has the structures suitable for fast computation of matrix-vector multiplication operations, which leads to the fast image reconstruction. The performance of the proposed scheme is assessed using real SAR image. The reconstructed SAR images with only one-fourth of the Nyquist data achieve the image quality similar to that of the classical SAR images with Nyquist samples.;cs.IT
1801.03616;Parity-Check Polar Coding for 5G and Beyond;In this paper, we propose a comprehensive Polar coding solution that integrates reliability calculation, rate matching and parity-check coding. Judging a channel coding design from the industry's viewpoint, there are two primary concerns: (i) low-complexity implementation in application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), and (ii) superior \&amp, stable performance under a wide range of code lengths and rates. The former provides cost- \&amp, power-efficiency which are vital to any commercial system, the latter ensures flexible and robust services. Our design respects both criteria. It demonstrates better performance than existing schemes in literature, but requires only a fraction of implementation cost. With easily-reproducible code construction for arbitrary code rates and lengths, we are able to report "1-bit" fine-granularity simulation results for thousands of cases. The released results can serve as a baseline for future optimization of Polar codes.;cs.IT
1801.03619;RAF: Robust Adaptive Multi-Feedback Channel Estimation for Millimeter Wave MIMO Systems;Millimeter wave is a promising technology for the next generation of wireless systems. As it is well-known for its high path loss, the systems working in this spectrum tend to exploit the shorter wavelength to equip the transceivers with a large number of antennas to overcome the path loss issue. The large number of antennas leads to large channel matrices and consequently a challenging channel estimation problem. The channel estimation algorithms that have been proposed so far either neglect the probability of estimation error or require a high feedback overload from receivers to ensure the target probability of estimation error. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage adaptive channel estimation algorithm called robust adaptive multi-feedback (RAF). The algorithm is based on using the estimated channel coefficient to predict a lower bound for the required number of measurements. Our simulations demonstrate that compared with existing algorithms, RAF can achieve the desired probability of estimation error while on average reducing the feedback overhead by 75.5% and the total channel estimation time by 14%.;cs.IT
1801.03623;Optimal locally repairable codes of distance $3$ and $4$ via cyclic codes;Like classical block codes, a locally repairable code also obeys the Singleton-type bound (we call a locally repairable code {\it optimal} if it achieves the Singleton-type bound). In the breakthrough work of \cite{TB14}, several classes of optimal locally repairable codes were constructed via subcodes of Reed-Solomon codes. Thus, the lengths of the codes given in \cite{TB14} are upper bounded by the code alphabet size $q$. Recently, it was proved through extension of construction in \cite{TB14} that length of $q$-ary optimal locally repairable codes can be $q+1$ in \cite{JMX17}. Surprisingly, \cite{BHHMV16} presented a few examples of $q$-ary optimal locally repairable codes of small distance and locality with code length achieving roughly $q^2$. Very recently, it was further shown in \cite{LMX17} that there exist $q$-ary optimal locally repairable codes with length bigger than $q+1$ and distance propositional to $n$. <br />Thus, it becomes an interesting and challenging problem to construct new families of $q$-ary optimal locally repairable codes of length bigger than $q+1$. <br />In this paper, we construct a class of optimal locally repairable codes of distance $3$ and $4$ with unbounded length (i.e., length of the codes is independent of the code alphabet size). Our technique is through cyclic codes with particular generator and parity-check polynomials that are carefully chosen.;cs.IT

1801.03641;To Relay or not to Relay: Open Distance and Optimal Deployment for Linear Underwater Acoustic Networks;Existing works have widely studied relay-aided underwater acoustic networks under some specialized relay distributions, e.g., equidistant and rectangular-grid. In this paper, we investigate two fundamental problems that under which conditions a relay should be deployed and where to deploy it if necessary in terms of the energy and delay performance in linear underwater acoustic networks. To address these two problems, we first accurately approximate the complicated effective bandwidth and transmit power in the logarithm domain to formulate an energy minimization problem. By analyzing the formulation, we discover a critical transmission distance, defined as open distance, and explicitly show that a relay should not be deployed if the transmission distance is less than the open distance and should be otherwise. Most importantly, we derive a closed-form and easy-to-calculate expression for the open distance and also strictly prove that the optimal placing position is at the middle point of the link when a relay should be introduced. Moreover, although this paper considers a linear two-hop relay network as the first step, our derived results can be applied to construct energy-efficient and delay-friendly multi-hop networks. Simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and show that properly introducing a relay can dramatically reduce the network energy consumption almost without increasing the end-to-end delay.;cs.IT
1801.03647;On sums of weighted averages of $\gcd$-sum functions;Let $\gcd(j,k)$ be the greatest common divisor of the integers $j$ and $k$. In this paper, we give several interesting asymptotic formulas for weighted averages of the $\gcd$-sum function $f(\gcd(j,k)) $ and the function $\sum_{d|k, d^{s}|j}(f*\mu)(d) $ for any positive integers $j$ and $k$, namely $$ \sum_{k\leq x}\frac{1}{k^{r+1}}\sum_{j=1}^{k}j^{r}f(\gcd(j,k)) \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{k\leq x}\frac{1}{k^{s(r+1)}}\sum_{j=1}^{k^s}j^{r} \sum_{\substack{d|k d^{s}|j}}(f*\mu)(d), $$ with any fixed integer $s&gt, 1$ and any arithmetical function $f$. We also establish mean value formulas for the error terms of asymptotic formulas for partial sums of $\gcd$-sum functions $f(\gcd(j,k)). $;math.NT
1801.03653;Sums of weighted averages of gcd-sum functions II;In this paper, we establish the following two identities involving the Gamma function and Bernoulli polynomials, namely $$ \sum_{k\leq x}\frac{1}{k^s} \sum_{j=1}^{k^s}\log\Gamma\left(\frac{j}{k^s}\right) <br />\sum_{\substack{d|k \\ d^{s}|j}}f*\mu(d) \quad {\rm and } \quad \sum_{k\leq x}\frac{1}{k^s}\sum_{j=0}^{k^{s}-1} <br />B_{m}\sum_{\substack{d|k \\ d^{s}|j}} f*\mu(d) $$ with any fixed integer $s&gt, 1$ and any arithmetical function $f$. We give asymptotic formulas for them with various multiplicative functions $f$. We also consider several formulas of the Dirichlet series associated with the above identities. This paper is a continuation of an earlier work of the authors.;math.NT
1801.03654;Proving some identities of Gosper on $q$-trigonometric functions;Gosper introduced the functions $\sin_q z$ and $\cos_q z$ as $q$-analogues for the trigonometric functions $\sin z$ and $\cos z$ respectively. He stated but did not prove a variety of identities involving these two $q$-trigonometric functions. In this paper, we shall use the theory of elliptic functions to prove three formulas from the list of Gosper on the functions $\sin_q z$ and $\cos_q z$.;math.NT
1801.03655;Can Negligible Cooperation Increase Network Capacity? The Average-Error Case;In communication networks, cooperative strategies are coding schemes where network nodes work together to improve network performance metrics such as sum-rate. This work studies encoder cooperation in the setting of a discrete multiple access channel with two encoders and a single decoder. A node in the network that is connected to both encoders via rate-limited links, referred to as the cooperation facilitator (CF), enables the cooperation strategy. Previously, the authors presented a class of multiple access channels where the average-error sum-capacity has an infinite derivative in the limit where CF output link capacities approach zero. The authors also demonstrated that for some channels, the maximal-error sum-capacity is not continuous at the point where the output link capacities of the CF equal zero. This work shows that the the average-error sum-capacity is continuous when CF output link capacities converge to zero, that is, the infinite derivative of the average-error sum-capacity is not a result of its discontinuity as in the maximal-error case.;cs.IT
1801.03656;Quantum Encryption and Generalized Quantum Shannon Impossibility;The famous Shannon impossibility result says that any encryption scheme with perfect secrecy requires a secret key at least as long as the message. In this paper we provide its quantum analogue with imperfect secrecy and imperfect correctness. We also give a systematic study of information-theoretically secure quantum encryption with two secrecy definitions. We show that the weaker one implies the stronger but with a security loss in $d$, where $d$ is the dimension of the encrypted quantum system. This is good enough if the target secrecy error is of $o(d^{-1})$.;cs.IT

1801.03663;From Uncertainty Data to Robust Policies for Temporal Logic Planning;We consider the problem of synthesizing robust disturbance feedback policies for systems performing complex tasks. We formulate the tasks as linear temporal logic specifications and encode them into an optimization framework via mixed-integer constraints. Both the system dynamics and the specifications are known but affected by uncertainty. The distribution of the uncertainty is unknown, however realizations can be obtained. We introduce a data-driven approach where the constraints are fulfilled for a set of realizations and provide probabilistic generalization guarantees as a function of the number of considered realizations. We use separate chance constraints for the satisfaction of the specification and operational constraints. This allows us to quantify their violation probabilities independently. We compute disturbance feedback policies as solutions of mixed-integer linear or quadratic optimization problems. By using feedback we can exploit information of past realizations and provide feasibility for a wider range of situations compared to static input sequences. We demonstrate the proposed method on two robust motion-planning case studies for autonomous driving.;math.OC
1801.03668;Asynchronous Mobile-Edge Computation Offloading: Energy-Efficient Resource Management;Mobile-edge computation offloading (MECO) is an emerging technology for enhancing mobiles' computation capabilities and prolonging their battery lives, by offloading intensive computation from mobiles to nearby servers such as base stations. In this paper, we study the energy-efficient resource-management policy for the asynchronous MECO system, where the mobiles have heterogeneous input-data arrival time instants and computation deadlines. First, we consider the general case with arbitrary arrival-deadline orders. Based on the monomial energy-consumption model for data transmission, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the total mobile-energy consumption under the time-sharing and computation-deadline constraints. The optimal resource-management policy for data partitioning (for offloading and local computing) and time division (for transmissions) is shown to be computed by using the block coordinate decent method. To gain further insights, we study the optimal resource-management design for two special cases. First, consider the case of identical arrival-deadline orders, i.e., a mobile with input data arriving earlier also needs to complete computation earlier. The optimization problem is reduced to two sequential problems corresponding to the optimal scheduling order and joint data-partitioning and time-division given the optimal order. It is found that the optimal time-division policy tends to balance the defined effective computing power among offloading mobiles via time sharing. Furthermore, this solution approach is extended to the case of reverse arrival-deadline orders. The corresponding time-division policy is derived by a proposed transformation-and-scheduling approach, which first determines the total offloading duration and data size for each mobile in the transformation phase and then specifies the offloading intervals for each mobile in the scheduling phase.;cs.IT
1801.03673;Ecologically Sustainable Partitioning of a Metapopulations Network;A stable population network is hard to interrupt without any ecological consequences. A communication blockage between patches may destabilize the populations in the ecological network. This work deals with the construction of a safe cut passing through metapopulations habitat such that populations remain stable. We combine the dynamical system stability analysis with graph partitioning algorithms in our approach to the problem. It finds such a safe construction, when one exists, provided the algebraic connectivity of the graph components is stronger than all the spatially local instabilities in the respective components. The dynamics of the populations on the spatially discrete patches (graph nodes) and their spatial communication with other patches is modeled as a reaction-diffusion system. By reversing the Turing-instability idea the stability conditions of the partitioned system are found to depend on local dynamics of the metapopulations and the Fiedler value of the Laplacian matrix of the graph. This leads to the necessary and sufficient conditions for removal of the graph edges subject to the stability of the partitioned graph networks. An heuristic bisection graph partitioning algorithm has been proposed and examples illustrate the theoretical result.;math.DS
1801.03677;Algebras with irreducible module varieties II: Two vertex case;We call a finite-dimensional K-algebra A geometrically irreducible if for all d all connected components of the affine scheme of d-dimensional A-modules are irreducible. We prove that a geometrically irreducible algebra with exactly two simple modules has to be of a very special form, which we describe. Based on this result we prove that every minimal geometrically irreducible algebra without shortcuts in its Gabriel quiver has at most two simple modules.;math.RT
1801.03682;Diffusion limits for a Markov modulated binomial counting process;In this paper we study limit behavior for a Markov-modulated (MM) binomial counting process, also called a binomial counting process under regime switching. Such a process naturally appears in the context of credit risk when multiple obligors are present. Markov-modulation takes place when the failure/default rate of each individual obligor depends on an underlying Markov chain. The limit behavior under consideration occurs when the number of obligors increases unboundedly, and/or by accelerating the modulating Markov process, called rapid switching. We establish diffusion approximations, obtained by application of (semi)martingale central limit theorems. Depending on the specific circumstances, different approximations are found.;math.PR
1801.03687;On the Reliability Function of Distributed Hypothesis Testing Under Optimal Detection;The distributed hypothesis testing problem with full side-information is studied. The trade-off (reliability function) between the two types of error exponents under limited rate is studied in the following way. First, the problem is reduced to the problem of determining the reliability function of channel codes designed for detection (in analogy to a similar result which connects the reliability function of distributed lossless compression and ordinary channel codes). Second, a single-letter random-coding bound based on a hierarchical ensemble, as well as a single-letter expurgated bound, are derived for the reliability of channel-detection codes. Both bounds are derived for a system which employs the optimal detection rule. We conjecture that the resulting random-coding bound is ensemble-tight, and consequently optimal within the class of quantization-and-binning schemes.;cs.IT
1801.03701;Oscillatory regimes in a mosquito population model with larval feedback on egg hatching;Understanding mosquitoes life cycle is of great interest presently because of the increasing impact of vector borne diseases in several countries. There is evidence of oscillations in mosquito populations independent of seasonality, still unexplained, based on observations both in laboratories and in nature. We propose a simple mathematical model of egg hatching enhancement by larvae which produces such oscillations that conveys a possible explanation. We propose both a theoretical analysis, based on slow-fast dynamics and Hopf bifurcation, and numerical investigations in order to shed some light on the mechanisms at work in this model.;math.DS
1801.03705;Exact Calculation of Normalized Maximum Likelihood Code Length Using Fourier Analysis;The normalized maximum likelihood code length has been widely used in model selection, and its favorable properties, such as its consistency and the upper bound of its statistical risk, have been demonstrated. This paper proposes a novel methodology for calculating the normalized maximum likelihood code length on the basis of Fourier analysis. Our methodology provides an efficient non-asymptotic calculation formula for exponential family models and an asymptotic calculation formula for general parametric models with a weaker assumption compared to that in previous work.;math.ST
1801.03706;Energy conditions and twisted localizations of operators;We show that the energy conditions are not necessary for boundedness of fractional Riesz transforms in dimension at least 2.

1801.03714;Multi-Band Covariance Interpolation with Applications in Massive MIMO;In this paper, we study the problem of multi-band (frequency-variant) covariance interpolation with a particular emphasis towards massive MIMO applications. In a massive MIMO system, the communication between each BS with $M \gg 1$ antennas and each single-antenna user occurs through a collection of scatterers in the environment, where the channel vector of each user at BS antennas consists in a weighted linear combination of the array responses of the scatterers, where each scatterer has its own angle of arrival (AoA) and complex channel gain. The array response at a given AoA depends on the wavelength of the incoming planar wave and is naturally frequency dependent. This results in a frequency-dependent distortion where the second order statistics, i.e., the covariance matrix, of the channel vectors varies with frequency. In this paper, we show that although this effect is generally negligible for a small number of antennas $M$, it results in a considerable distortion of the covariance matrix and especially its dominant signal subspace in the massive MIMO regime where $M \to \infty$, and can generally incur a serious degradation of the performance especially in frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive MIMO systems where the uplink (UL) and the downlink (DL) communication occur over different frequency bands. We propose a novel UL-DL covariance interpolation technique that is able to recover the covariance matrix in the DL from an estimate of the covariance matrix in the UL under a mild reciprocity condition on the angular power spread function (PSF) of the users. We analyze the performance of our proposed scheme mathematically and prove its robustness under a sufficiently large spatial oversampling of the array. We also propose several simple off-the-shelf algorithms for UL-DL covariance interpolation and evaluate their performance via numerical simulations.;cs.IT
1801.03716;Functoriality of the EH class and the LOSS invariant under Lagrangian concordances;We show that the EH class and the LOSS invariant of Legendrian knots in contact 3-manifolds are functorial under regular Lagrangian concordances in Weinstein cobordisms. This gives computable obstructions to the existence of regular Lagrangian concordances.;math.GT
1801.03717;How to Split UL/DL Antennas in Full-Duplex Cellular Networks;To further improve the potential of full-duplex communications, networks may employ multiple antennas at the base station or user equipment. To this end, networks that employ current radios usually deal with self-interference and multi-user interference by beamforming techniques. Although previous works investigated beamforming design to improve spectral efficiency, the fundamental question of how to split the antennas at a base station between uplink and downlink in full-duplex networks has not been investigated rigorously. This paper addresses this question by posing antenna splitting as a binary nonlinear optimization problem to minimize the sum mean squared error of the received data symbols. It is shown that this is an NP-hard problem. This combinatorial problem is dealt with by equivalent formulations, iterative convex approximations, and a binary relaxation. The proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a stationary solution of the relaxed problem with much smaller complexity than exhaustive search. Numerical results indicate that the proposed solution is close to the optimal in both high and low self-interference capable scenarios, while the usually assumed antenna splitting is far from optimal. For large number of antennas, a simple antenna splitting is close to the proposed solution. This reveals that the importance of antenna splitting is inversely proportional with the number of antennas.;cs.IT
1801.03728;Enhancing Physical Layer Security in AF Relay Assisted Multi-Carrier Wireless Transmission;In this paper, we study the physical layer security (PLS) problem in the dual hop orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based wireless communication system. First, we consider a single user single relay system and study a joint power optimization problem at the source and relay subject to individual power constraint at the two nodes. The aim is to maximize the end to end secrecy rate with optimal power allocation over different sub-carriers. Later, we consider a more general multi-user multi-relay scenario. Under high SNR approximation for end to end secrecy rate, an optimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize power allocation at the BS, the relay selection, sub-carrier assignment to users and the power loading at each of the relaying node. The target is to maximize the overall security of the system subject to independent power budget limits at each transmitting node and the OFDMA based exclusive sub-carrier allocation constraints. A joint optimization solution is obtained through duality theory. Dual decomposition allows to exploit convex optimization techniques to find the power loading at the source and relay nodes. Further, an optimization for power loading at relaying nodes along with relay selection and sub carrier assignment for the fixed power allocation at the BS is also studied. Lastly, a sub-optimal scheme that explores joint power allocation at all transmitting nodes for the fixed subcarrier allocation and relay assignment is investigated. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate the performance of the proposed schemes.;cs.IT

Our goal is to find non-trivial solutions in the variables x_i, 1\leq i\leq 3, all of size about P, assuming that \tet is sufficiently large. We study this problem on average over \alp_3 and generalize previous work of Bourgain on quadratic ternary diagonal forms to general degree k.;math.NT
1801.03739;A Stochastic Pitchfork Bifurcation in Most Probable Phase Portraits;We study stochastic bifurcation for a system under multiplicative stable Levy noise (an important class of non-Gaussian noise), by examining the qualitative changes of equilibrium states in its most probable phase portraits. We have found some peculiar bifurcation phenomena in contrast to the deterministic counterpart: (i) When the non-Gaussianity parameter in Levy noise varies, there is either one, two or none backward pitchfork type bifurcations, (ii) When a parameter in the vector field varies, there are two or three forward pitchfork bifurcations, (iii) The non-Gaussian Levy noise clearly leads to fundamentally more complex bifurcation scenarios, since in the special case of Gaussian noise, there is only one pitchfork bifurcation which is reminiscent of the deterministic situation.;math.DS
1801.03741;Double asymptotic for random walks on hypercubes;We consider the sum of the coordinates of a simple random walk on the K-dimensional hypercube, and prove a double asymptotic of this process, as both the time parameter n and the space parameter K tend to infinity. Depending on the asymptotic ratio of the two parameters, they converge towards either a Brownian motion, an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process or an i.i.d. collection of Gaussian variables.;math.PR
1801.03742;Quantization/clustering: when and why does k-means work?;Though mostly used as a clustering algorithm, k-means are originally designed as a quantization algorithm. Namely, it aims at providing a compression of a probability distribution with k points. Building upon [21, 33], we try to investigate how and when these two approaches are compatible. Namely, we show that provided the sample distribution satisfies a margin like condition (in the sense of [27] for supervised learning), both the associated empirical risk minimizer and the output of Lloyd's algorithm provide almost optimal classification in certain cases (in the sense of [6]). Besides, we also show that they achieved fast and optimal convergence rates in terms of sample size and compression risk.;math.ST
1801.03748;Performance Evaluation of Advanced Relaying Protocols in Large Wireless Networks;This paper studies the performance of some state-of-the-art cooperative full-duplex relaying protocols in the context of a large wireless network modelled using stochastic geometry tools. We investigate the outage behaviour for different cooperative schemes, namely, decode-and-forward, noisy-network coding and mixed noisy-network coding, considering fading, path loss and interference from other sources and relays. Due to the high complexity of the network topology and the protocols considered, a closed-form analysis is not possible, so our study is performed through extensive but careful numerical simulations, sweeping a large number of relevant parameters. Several scenarios of particular interest are investigated. In this way, insightful conclusions are drawn regarding the network regimes in which relay-assisted cooperation is most beneficial and the potential gains that could be achieved through it.;cs.IT
1801.03749;Improved asynchronous parallel optimization analysis for stochastic incremental methods;As datasets continue to increase in size and multi-core computer architectures are developed, asynchronous parallel optimization algorithms become more and more essential to the field of Machine Learning. Unfortunately, conducting the theoretical analysis asynchronous methods is difficult, notably due to the introduction of delay and inconsistency in inherently sequential algorithms. Handling these issues often requires resorting to simplifying but unrealistic assumptions. Through a novel perspective, we revisit and clarify a subtle but important technical issue present in a large fraction of the recent convergence rate proofs for asynchronous parallel optimization algorithms, and propose a simplification of the recently introduced "perturbed iterate" framework that resolves it. We demonstrate the usefulness of our new framework by analyzing three distinct asynchronous parallel incremental optimization algorithms: Hogwild (asynchronous SGD), KROMAGNON (asynchronous SVRG) and ASAGA, a novel asynchronous parallel version of the incremental gradient algorithm SAGA that enjoys fast linear convergence rates. We are able to both remove problematic assumptions and obtain better theoretical results. Notably, we prove that ASAGA and KROMAGNON can obtain a theoretical linear speedup on multi-core systems even without sparsity assumptions. We present results of an implementation on a 40-core architecture illustrating the practical speedups as well as the hardware overhead. Finally, we investigate the overlap constant, an ill-understood but central quantity for the theoretical analysis of asynchronous parallel algorithms. We find that it encompasses much more complexity than suggested in previous work, and often is order-of-magnitude bigger than traditionally thought.;math.OC
1801.03752;Sheaves of categories with local actions of Hochschild cochains;The notion of Hochschild cochains induces an assignment from $Aff$, affine DG schemes, to monoidal DG categories. We show that this assignment extends, under some appropriate finiteness conditions, to a functor $\mathbb H: Aff \to AlgBimod(DGCat)$, where the latter denotes the category of monoidal DG categories and bimodules. Now, any functor $\mathbb A: Aff \to AlgBimod(DGCat)$ gives rise, by taking modules, to a theory of sheaves of categories $ShvCat^{\mathbb A}$. <br />In this paper, we study $ShvCat^{\mathbb H}$. Vaguely speaking, this theory categorifies the theory of D-modules, in the same way as Gaitsgory's original $ShvCat$ categorifies the theory of quasi-coherent sheaves. We develop the functoriality of $ShvCat^{\mathbb H}$, its descent properties and, most importantly, the notion of $\mathbb H$-affineness. We then prove the $\mathbb H$-affineness of algebraic stacks: for $Y$ a stack satisfying some mild conditions, the $\infty$-category $ShvCat^{\mathbb H}(Y)$ is equivalent to the $\infty$-category of modules for $\mathbb H(Y)$, the monoidal DG category defined in <a href="/abs/1709.07867">arXiv:1709.07867</a>. <br />As an application, consider a quasi-smooth stack $Y$ and a DG category $C$ with an action of $\mathbb H(Y)$. Then $C$ admits a theory of singular support in $Sing(Y)$, where $Sing(Y)$ is the space of singularities of $Y$.;math.AG

1801.03760;Estimation of Local Anisotropy Based on Level Sets;Consider an affine Gaussian field X : R 2 $\rightarrow$ R, that is a process equal in law to Z(At), where Z is isotropic and A : R2 $\rightarrow$ R2 is a self-adjoint definite positive matrix. Denote 0 &lt, $\lambda$ = $\lambda$\_2 / $\lambda$\_1 \le 1 the ratio of the eigenvalues of A. This paper is aimed at testing the null hypothesis '' X is isotropic'' versus the alternative '' X is affine''. Roughly speaking, this amounts to testing '' $\lambda$ = 1 '' versus '' $\lambda$ &lt, 1 ''. By setting level u in R, this is implemented by the partial observations of process X through some particular level functionals viewed over a square T, which grows to R2. This leads us to provide estimators for the affinity parameters that are shown to be almost surely consistent. Their asymptotic normality provide confidence intervals for parameters. This paper offered an important opportunity to study general level functionals near the level u, part of the difficulties arises from the fact that the topology of level set CT,X (u) = {t $\in$ T : X(t) = u} can be irregular, even if the trajectories of X are regular. A significant part of the paper is dedicated to show the L2-continuity in the level u of these general functionals.;math.PR

1801.03765;Non-stationary Douglas-Rachford and alternating direction method of multipliers: adaptive stepsizes and convergence;We revisit the classical Douglas-Rachford (DR) method for finding a zero of the sum of two maximal monotone operators. Since the practical performance of the DR method crucially depends on the stepsizes, we aim at developing an adaptive stepsize rule. To that end, we take a closer look at a linear case of the problem and use our findings to develop a stepsize strategy that eliminates the need for stepsize tuning. We analyze a general non-stationary DR scheme and prove its convergence for a convergent sequence of stepsizes with summable increments. This, in turn, proves the convergence of the method with the new adaptive stepsize rule. We also derive the related non-stationary alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) from such a non-stationary DR method. We illustrate the efficiency of the proposed methods on several numerical examples.;math.OC
1801.03770;Koszul-Tate resolutions as cofibrant replacements of algebras over differential operators;Homotopical geometry over differential operators is a convenient setting for a coordinate-free investigation of nonlinear partial differential equations modulo symmetries. One of the first issues one meets in the functor of points approach to homotopical $\mathcal{D}$-geometry, is the question of a model structure on the category $\tt DGAlg(\mathcal{D})$ of differential non-negatively graded $\mathcal{O}$-quasi-coherent sheaves of commutative algebras over the sheaf $\mathcal{D}$ of differential operators of an appropriate underlying variety $(X,\mathcal{O})$. We define a cofibrantly generated model structure on $\tt DGAlg(\mathcal{D})$ via the definition of its weak equivalences and its fibrations, characterize the class of cofibrations, and build an explicit functorial `cofibration - trivial fibration' factorization. We then use the latter to get a functorial model categorical Koszul-Tate resolution for $\mathcal{D}$-algebraic `on-shell function' algebras (which contains the classical Koszul-Tate resolution). The paper is also the starting point for a homotopical $\mathcal{D}$-geometric Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism.;math.AT

Moreover, we establish the mean square exponential stability and quasi sure exponential stability of the solutions be means of G-Lyapunov function method. An example is presented to illustrate the efficiency of the obtained results.;math.PR
1801.03777;On the global well-posedness of a class of 2D solutions for the Rosensweig system of ferrofluids;We study study a class of 2D solutions of a Bloch-Torrey regularization of the Rosensweig system in the whole space, which arise when the initial data and the external magnetic field are 2D. We prove that such solutions are globally defined if the initial data is in $ H^k\left(\mathbb{R}^2\right), k\geqslant 1 $.;math.AP
1801.03780;A Sundaram type bijection for SO(3): vacillating tableaux and pairs of standard Young tableaux and orthogonal Littlewood-Richardson tableaux;Based on the direct-sum-decomposition of the rth tensor power of the defining representation of the special orthogonal group SO(2k+1) one is interested in a bijective approach for determining the Frobenius characters of the isotypic components. In particular this leads us to a bijection between vacillating tableaux and pairs of standard Young tableaux and orthogonal Littlewood-Richardson tableaux, which we present for SO(3). Moreover we introduce the descent set of a vacillating tableau. As our bijection preserves this descent set, we also obtain the quasi-symmetric expansion of the Frobenius characters.;math.CO
1801.03785;Computability of Frames in Computable Hilbert Spaces;Frames play an important role in various practical problems related to signal and image processing. In this paper, we define computable frames in computable Hilbert spaces and obtain computable versions of some of their characterizations. Also, the notion of duality of frames in the context of computability has been studied. Finally, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a computable dual frame is obtained.;math.FA
1801.03786;On a reduction of nonlinear evolution and wave type equations via non-point symmetry method;We study the symmetry reduction of nonlinear evolution and wave type differential equations by using operators of non-point symmetry. In our approach we use both operators of classical and conditional symmetry. It appears that the combination of non-point and conditional symmetry enables us to construct not only solutions but B\"acklund transformations too for the equation under study. We show that the method can be applied to nonevolutionary partial differential equations.;math.AP

1801.03789;$L_1/\ell_1$-to-$L_1/\ell_1$ analysis of linear positive impulsive systems with application to the $L_1/\ell_1$-to-$L_1/\ell_1$ interval observation of linear impulsive and switched systems;Sufficient conditions characterizing the asymptotic stability and the hybrid $L_1/\ell_1$-gain of linear positive impulsive systems under minimum and range dwell-time constraints are obtained. These conditions are stated as infinite-dimensional linear programming problems that can be solved using sum of squares programming, a relaxation that is known to be asymptotically exact in the present case. These conditions are then adapted to formulate constructive and convex sufficient conditions for the existence of $L_1/\ell_1$-to-$L_1/\ell_1$ interval observers for linear impulsive and switched systems. Suitable observer gains can be extracted from the (suboptimal) solution of the infinite-dimensional optimization problem where the $L_1/\ell_1$-gain of the system mapping the disturbances to the weighted observation errors is minimized. Some examples on impulsive and switched systems are given for illustration.;math.OC
1801.03794;Hybrid NOMA-TDMA for Multiple Access Channels with Non-Ideal Batteries and Circuit Cost;We consider a multiple-access channel where the users are powered from batteries having non-negligible internal resistance. When power is drawn from the battery, a variable fraction of the power, which is a function of the power drawn from the battery, is lost across the internal resistance. Hence, the power delivered to the load is less than the power drawn from the battery. The users consume a constant power for the circuit operation during transmission but do not consume any power when not transmitting. In this setting, we obtain the maximum sum-rates and achievable rate regions under various cases. We show that, unlike in the ideal battery case, the TDMA (time-division multiple access) strategy, wherein the users transmit orthogonally in time, may not always achieve the maximum sum-rate when the internal resistance is non-zero. The users may need to adopt a hybrid NOMA-TDMA strategy which combines the features of NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) and TDMA, wherein a set of users are allocated fixed time windows for orthogonal single-user and non-orthogonal joint transmissions, respectively. We also numerically show that the maximum achievable rate regions in NOMA and TDMA strategies are contained within the maximum achievable rate region of the hybrid NOMA-TDMA strategy.;cs.IT
1801.03798;Multipliers of nilpotent Lie superalgebras;In this paper, first we prove that all finite dimensional special Heisenberg Lie superalgebras with even center have same dimension, say $(2m+1\mid n)$ for some non-negative integers $m,n$ and are isomorphism with them. Further, for a nilpotent Lie superalgebra $L$ of dimension $(m\mid n)$ and $\dim (L') = (r\mid s)$ with $r+s \geq 1$, we find the upper bound $\dim \mathcal{M}(L)\leq \frac{1}{2}\left[(m + n + r + s - 2)(m + n - r -s -1) \right] + n + 1$, where $\mathcal{M}(L)$ denotes the Schur multiplier of $L$. Moreover, if $(r, s) =(1, 0)\, (\mathrm{respectively}\, (r,s) = (0,1))$, then the equality holds if and only if $L \cong H(1,0) \oplus A_{1}\, (\mathrm{respectively}\, H(0,1) \oplus A_{2})$, where $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ are abelian Lie superalgebras with $\dim A_{1}=(m-3 \mid n), \dim A_{2}=(m-1 \mid n-1)$ and $H(1,0), H(0,1)$ are special Heisenberg Lie superalgebras of dimension $3$ and $2$ respectively.;math.RA
1801.03807;Iterated integrals on $\mathbb{P}^{1}\setminus\{0,1,\infty,z\}$ and a class of relations among multiple zeta values;In this paper we consider iterated integrals on $\mathbb{P}^{1}\setminus\{0,1,\infty,z\}$ and define a class of $\mathbb{Q}$-linear relations among them, which arises from the differential structure of the iterated integrals with respect to $z$. We then define a new class of $\mathbb{Q}$-linear relations among the multiple zeta values by taking their limits of $z\rightarrow1$, which we call \emph{confluence relations} (i.e., the relations obtained by the confluence of two punctured points). One of the significance of the confluence relations is that it gives a rich family and seems to exhaust all the linear relations among the multiple zeta values. As a good reason for this, we show that confluence relations imply both the regularized double shuffle relations and the duality relations.;math.NT
1801.03810;Magnetic rings;We study functional and spectral properties of perturbations of the magnetic Laplace operator on the circle. This operator appears when considering the restriction to the unit circle of a two-dimensional Schr{\"o}dinger operator with the Bohm-Aharonov vector potential. We prove a Hardy-type inequality on the two-dimensional Euclidean space and, on the circle, a sharp interpolation inequality and a sharp Keller-Lieb-Thirring inequality.;math.AP
1801.03813;Energy Harvesting Communications Using Dual Alternating Batteries;Practical energy harvesting (EH) based communication systems typically use a battery to temporarily store the harvested energy prior to its use for communication. The batteries can be damaged when they are repeatedly charged (discharged) after being partially discharged (charged), overcharged or deeply discharged. This motivates the cycle constraint which says that a battery must be charged (discharged) only after it is sufficiently discharged (charged). We also assume Bernoulli energy arrivals, and a half-duplex constraint due to which the batteries are not charged and discharged simultaneously. In this context, we study EH communication systems with: (a) a single-battery with capacity 2B units and (b) dual-batteries, each having capacity of B units. The aim is to obtain the best possible long-term average throughputs and throughput regions in point-to-point (P2P) channels and multiple access channels (MAC), respectively. For the P2P channel, we obtain an analytical optimal solution in the single-battery case, and propose optimal and sub-optimal power allocation policies for the dual-battery case. We extend these policies to obtain achievable throughput regions in MACs by jointly allocating rates and powers. From numerical simulations, we find that the optimal throughput in the dual-battery case is significantly higher than that in the single-battery case, although the total storage capacity in both cases is 2B units. Further, in the proposed policies, the largest throughput region in the single-battery case is contained within that of the dual-battery case.;cs.IT
1801.03822;W-algebras as coset vertex algebras;We prove the long-standing conjecture on the coset construction of the minimal series principal $W$-algebras of $ADE$ types in full generality. We do this by first establishing Feigin's conjecture on the coset realization of the universal principal $W$-algebras, which are not necessarily simple. As consequences, the unitarity of the "discrete series" of principal $W$-algebras is established, a second coset realization of rational and unitary $W$-algebras of type $A$ and $D$ are given and the rationality of Kazama-Suzuki coset vertex superalgebras is derived.;math.QA
1801.03828;Two-valued local sets of the 2D continuum Gaussian free field: connectivity, labels, and induced metrics;We study two-valued local sets, $\mathbb{A}_{-a,b}$, of the two-dimensional continuum Gaussian free field (GFF) with zero boundary condition in simply connected domains. Intuitively, $\mathbb{A}_{-a,b}$ is the (random) set of points connected to the boundary by a path on which the values of the GFF remain in $[-a,b]$. For specific choices of the parameters $a, b$ the two-valued sets have the law of the CLE$_4$ carpet, the law of the union of level lines between all pairs of boundary points, or, conjecturally, the law of the interfaces of the scaling limit of XOR-Ising model. <br />Two-valued sets are the closure of the union of countably many SLE$_4$ type of loops, where each loop comes with a label equal to either $-a$ or $b$. One of the main results of this paper describes the connectivity properties of these loops. Roughly, we show that all the loops are disjoint if $a+b \geq 4\lambda$, and that their intersection graph is connected if $a + b &lt, 4\lambda$. This also allows us to study the labels (the heights) of the loops. We prove that the labels of the loops are a function of the set $\mathbb{A}_{-a,b}$ if and only if $a\neq b$ and $2\lambda \leq a+b &lt, 4\lambda$ and that the labels are independent given the set if and only if $a = b = 2\lambda$. We also show that the threshold for the level-set percolation in the 2D continuum GFF is $-2\lambda$. <br />Finally, we discuss the coupling of the labelled CLE$_4$ with the GFF. We characterise this coupling as a specific local set coupling, and show how to approximate these local sets. We further see how in these approximations the labels naturally encode distances to the boundary.;math.PR
1801.03830;Convergence Analysis of Sample Average Approximation of Two-stage Stochastic Generalized Equations;A solution of two-stage stochastic generalized equations is a pair: a first stage solution which is independent of realization of the random data and a second stage solution which is a function of random variables.This paper studies convergence of the sample average approximation of two-stage stochastic nonlinear generalized equations. In particular an exponential rate of the convergence is shown by using the perturbed partial linearization of functions. Moreover, sufficient conditions for the existence, uniqueness, continuity and regularity of solutions of two-stage stochastic generalized equations are presented under an assumption of monotonicity of the involved functions. These theoretical results are given without assuming relatively complete recourse, and are illustrated by two-stage stochastic non-cooperative games of two players.;math.OC
1801.03831;Strange attractors and non wandering domains near a homoclinic cycle to a bifocus;In this paper, we explore the three-dimensional chaotic set near a homoclinic cycle to a hyperbolic bifocus at which the vector field has negative divergence. If the invariant manifolds of the bifocus satisfy a non-degeneracy condition, a sequence of hyperbolic suspended horseshoes arises near the cycle, with one expanding and two contracting directions. We extend previous results on the field and we show that the first return map to a given cross section may be approximated by a map exhibiting heteroclinic tangencies associated to two periodic orbits. When the cycle is broken, under an additional hypothesis about the coexistence of two heteroclinically related periodic points (one without dominated splitting into one-dimensional sub-bundles), the heteroclinic tangencies can be slightly modified in order to satisfy Tatjer's conditions for a generalized tangency of codimension two. This configuration may be seen as the organizing center, by which one can obtain Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations and therefore, strange attractors, infinitely many sinks and non-trivial contracting wandering domains.;math.DS
1801.03839;Cohen class of time-frequency representations and operators: boundedness and uncertainty principles;This paper presents a proof of an uncertainty principle of Donoho-Stark type involving $\varepsilon$-concentration of localization operators. More general operators associated with time-frequency representations in the Cohen class are then considered. For these operators, which include all usual quantizations, we prove a boundedness result in the $L^p$ functional setting and a form of uncertainty principle analogous to that for localization operators.;math.FA
1801.03847;A geometric statement of the Harnack inequality for a degenerate Kolmogorov equation with rough coefficients;We consider weak solutions of degenerate second order partial differential equations of Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck type with measurable coefficients in divergence form. We give a geometric statement of the Harnack inequality recently proven by Golse, Imbert, Mouhot and Vasseur. As a corollary we obtain a strong maximum principle.;math.AP
1801.03852;Computing the density of states for optical spectra by low-rank and QTT tensor approximation;In this paper, we introduce a new interpolation scheme to approximate the density of states (DOS) for a class of rank-structured matrices with application to the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). The presented approach for approximating the DOS is based on two main techniques. First, we propose an economical method for calculating the traces of parametric matrix resolvents at interpolation points by taking advantage of the block-diagonal plus low-rank matrix structure described in [6, 3] for the BSE/TDA problem. Second, we show that a regularized or smoothed DOS discretized on a fine grid of size $N$ can be accurately represented by a low rank quantized tensor train (QTT) tensor that can be determined through a least squares fitting procedure. The latter provides good approximation properties for strictly oscillating DOS functions with multiple gaps, and requires asymptotically much fewer ($O(\log N)$) functional calls compared with the full grid size $N$. This approach allows us to overcome the computational difficulties of the traditional schemes by avoiding both the need of stochastic sampling and interpolation by problem independent functions like polynomials etc. Numerical tests indicate that the QTT approach yields accurate recovery of DOS associated with problems that contain relatively large spectral gaps. The QTT tensor rank only weakly depends on the size of a molecular system which paves the way for treating large-scale spectral problems.;math.NA
1801.03854;Analysis of a Boundary-Domain Integral Equation System for the Mixed Interior Diffusion BVP with Variable Coefficient Based on a New Family of Parametrices;A mixed boundary value problem for the diffusion equation in non-homogeneous media partial differential equation is reduced to a system of direct segregated parametrix-based Boundary-Domain Integral Equations (BDIEs). We use a parametrix different from the one employed by Chkadua, Mikhailov and Natroshvili in the paper 'Analysis of direct boundary-domain integral equations for a mixed BVP with variable coefficient, I: Equivalence and invertibility'. Mapping properties of boundedness and compactness of parametrix-based surface and volume potentials are analysed in appropriate Sobolev spaces. Using these properties we prove the equivalence between the original BVP and the corresponding BDIE system. Furthermore, we prove uniqueness of solution of the BDIE system by applying the Fredholm Alternative.;math.AP

1801.03860;Symmetric road interchanges;A road interchange where $n$ roads meet and in which the drivers are not allowed to change lanes can be modelled as an embedding of a 2-coloured (hence bipartite) multigraph $G$ with equal-sized colour classes into an orientable surface such that there is a face bounded by a Hamiltonian cycle (Kurauskas, 2017). The case of $G$ a complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ corresponds to a complete $n$-way interchange where drivers approaching from each of $n$ directions can exit to any other direction. The genus of the underlying surface can be interpreted as the number of bridges in the interchange. <br />In this paper we study the minimum genus, or the minimum number of bridges, of a complete interchange with a restriction that it is symmetric under the cyclic permutation of its roads. We consider both (a) abstract combinatorial/topological symmetry, and (b) symmetry in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$. The proof of (a) is based on the classic voltage and transition graph constructions. For (b) we use, among other techniques, a simple new combinatorial lower bound.;math.CO
1801.03861;Construction and Performance of Quantum Burst Error Correction Codes for Correlated Errors;In practical communication and computation systems, errors occur predominantly in adjacent positions rather than in a random manner. In this paper, we develop a stabilizer formalism for quantum burst error correction codes (QBECC) to combat such error patterns in the quantum regime. Our contributions are as follows. Firstly, we derive an upper bound for the correctable burst errors of QBECCs, the quantum Reiger bound (QRB). This bound generalizes the quantum Singleton bound for standard quantum error correction codes (QECCs). Secondly, we propose two constructions of QBECCs: one by heuristic computer search and the other by concatenating two quantum tensor product codes (QTPCs). We obtain several new QBECCs with better parameters than existing codes with the same coding length. Moreover, some of the constructed codes can saturate the quantum Reiger bounds. Finally, we perform numerical experiments for our constructed codes over Markovian correlated depolarizing quantum memory channels, and show that QBECCs indeed outperform standard QECCs in this scenario.;cs.IT
1801.03865;A Monetary Mechanism for Stabilizing Cooperative Data Exchange with Selfish Users;This paper considers the problem of stabilizing cooperative data exchange with selfish users. In this setting, each user has a subset of packets in the ground set $X$, and wants all other packets in $X$. The users can exchange their packets by broadcasting coded or uncoded packets over a lossless broadcast channel, and monetary transactions are allowed between any pair of users. We define the utility of each user as the sum of two sub-utility functions: (i) the difference between the total payment received by the user and the total transmission rate of the user, and (ii) the difference between the total number of required packets by the user and the total payment made by the user. A rate-vector and payment-matrix pair $(r,p)$ is said to stabilize the grand coalition (i.e., the set of all users) if $(r,p)$ is Pareto optimal over all minor coalitions (i.e., all proper subsets of users who collectively know all packets in $X$). Our goal is to design a stabilizing rate-payment pair with minimum total sum-rate and minimum total sum-payment for any given instance of the problem. In this work, we propose two algorithms that find such a solution. Moreover, we show that both algorithms maximize the sum of utility of all users (over all solutions), and one of the algorithms also maximizes the minimum utility among all users (over all solutions).;cs.IT
1801.03867;Hopf algebras on decorated noncrossing arc diagrams;Noncrossing arc diagrams are combinatorial models for the equivalence classes of the lattice congruences of the weak order on permutations. In this paper, we provide a general method to endow these objects with Hopf algebra structures. Specific instances of this method produce relevant Hopf algebras that appeared earlier in the literature.;math.CO
1801.03868;An entropy inequality for symmetric random variables;We establish a lower bound on the entropy of weighted sums of (possibly dependent) random variables $(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n)$ possessing a symmetric joint distribution. Our lower bound is in terms of the joint entropy of $(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n)$. We show that for $n \geq 3$, the lower bound is tight if and only if $X_i$'s are i.i.d.\ Gaussian random variables. For $n=2$ there are numerous other cases of equality apart from i.i.d.\ Gaussians, which we completely characterize. Going beyond sums, we also present an inequality for certain linear transformations of $(X_1, \dots, X_n)$. Our primary technical contribution lies in the analysis of the equality cases, and our approach relies on the geometry and the symmetry of the problem.;cs.IT

1801.03873;Characterisation of honest times and optional semimartingales of class-($&#x3a3,$);Given a finite honest time, we first derive a representation of the additive (the multiplicative) decomposition of its Az\'ema optional supermartingale in terms of the draw-down (the relative draw-down) of some optional supermartingales with continuous running supremum. The multiplicative representation then allows us to give a characterisation of finite honest times using a family of non-negative optional supermartingales with continuous running supremum which converges to zero at infinity. Finally, we extend the notion of semimartingales of class-$(\Sigma)$ to optional semimartingales with jumps in its finite variation part, allowing one to establish formulae similar to the Madan-Roynette-Yor option pricing formula for larger class of processes.;math.PR
1801.03877;Paths to Understanding Birational Rowmotion on Products of Two Chains;Birational rowmotion is an action on the space of assignments of rational functions to the elements of a finite partially-ordered set (poset). It is lifted from the well-studied rowmotion map on order ideals (equivariantly on antichains) of a poset $P$, which when iterated on special posets, has unexpectedly nice properties in terms of periodicity, cyclic sieving, and homomesy (statistics whose averages over each orbit are constant) [AST11, BW74, CF95, Pan09, PR13, RuSh12,RuWa15+,SW12, ThWi17, Yil17. In this context, rowmotion appears to be related to Auslander-Reiten translation on certain quivers, and birational rowmotion to $Y$-systems of type $A_m \times A_n$ described in Zamolodchikov periodicity. <br />We give a formula in terms of families of non-intersecting lattice paths for iterated actions of the birational rowmotion map on a product of two chains. This allows us to give a much simpler direct proof of the key fact that the period of this map on a product of chains of lengths $r$ and $s$ is $r+s+2$ (first proved by D.~Grinberg and the second author), as well as the first proof of the birational analogue of homomesy along files for such posets.;math.CO
1801.03881;Relative functoriality and functional equations via trace formulas;Langlands' functoriality principle predicts deep relations between the local and automorphic spectra of different reductive groups. This has been generalized by the relative Langlands program to include spherical varieties, among which reductive groups are special cases. In the philosophy of Langlands' "beyond endoscopy" program, these relations should be expressed as comparisons between different trace formulas, with the insertion of appropriate $L$-functions. The insertion of $L$-functions calls for one more goal to be achieved: the study of their functional equations via trace formulas. <br />The goal of this article is to demonstrate this program through examples, indicating a local-to-global approach as in the project of endoscopy. Here, scalar transfer factors are replaced by "transfer operators" or "Hankel transforms" which are nice enough (typically, expressible in terms of usual Fourier transforms) that they can be used, in principle, to prove global comparisons (in the form of Poisson summation formulas). Some of these examples have already appeared in the literature, for others, the proofs will appear elsewhere.;math.NT
1801.03885;Zeroth-order general Randic index of $k$-generalized quasi trees;For a simple graph $G(V,E)$, the zeroth-order general Randi\' c index is defined as $^0R_{\alpha}(G)=\sum_{v\in V(G)}d(v)^{\alpha}$, where $d(v)$ is the degree of the vertex $v$ and $\alpha\ne0$ is a real number. The $k$-generalized quasi-tree is a connected graph $G$ with a subset $V_k\subset V(G)$, where $|V_k|=k$ such that $G-V_k$ is a tree, but for any subset $V_{k-1}\subset V(G)$ with cardinality $k-1$, $G-V_{k-1}$ is not a tree. In this paper, we characterize the extremal $k$-generalized quasi trees with the minimum and maximum values of the zeroth-order general Randi\' c index for $\alpha\neq 0$.;math.CO
1801.03887;Words have bounded width in $SL(n,\mathbb{Z})$;We prove two results about width of words in $SL_n(\mathbb{Z})$. The first is that, for every $n \geq 3$, there is a constant $C(n)$ such that the width of any word in $SL_n(\mathbb{Z})$ is less than $C(n)$. The second result is that, for any word $w$, if $n$ is big enough, the width of $w$ in $SL_n(\mathbb{Z})$ is at most 87.;math.GR
1801.03892;Privacy in Index Coding: Improved Bounds and Coding Schemes;It was recently observed in [1], that in index coding, learning the coding matrix used by the server can pose privacy concerns: curious clients can extract information about the requests and side information of other clients. One approach to mitigate such concerns is the use of $k$-limited-access schemes [1], that restrict each client to learn only part of the index coding matrix, and in particular, at most $k$ rows. These schemes transform a linear index coding matrix of rank $T$ to an alternate one, such that each client needs to learn at most $k$ of the coding matrix rows to decode its requested message. This paper analyzes $k$-limited-access schemes. First, a worst-case scenario, where the total number of clients $n$ is $2^T-1$ is studied. For this case, a novel construction of the coding matrix is provided and shown to be order-optimal in the number of transmissions. Then, the case of a general $n$ is considered and two different schemes are designed and analytically and numerically assessed in their performance. It is shown that these schemes perform better than the one designed for the case $n=2^T-1$.;cs.IT
1801.03894;Stability in the homology of Deligne-Mumford compactifications;Using the the theory of FS^op modules, we study the asymptotic behavior of the homology of $\overline M_{g,n}$, the Deligne--Mumford compactification of the moduli space of curves, for $n &gt,&gt, 0$. An FS^op module is a contravariant functor from the category of finite sets and surjections to vector spaces. Via maps that glue on marked P^1's, we give the homology of $\overline M_{g,n}$ the structure of an FS^op module and bound its degree of generation. As a consequence, we prove that the generating function $\sum_{n} \dim(H_i(\overline M_{g,n})) t^n$ is rational, and its denominator has roots in the set $\{1, 1/2, \dots, 1/p(g,i)\}$ where $p(g,i)$ is a polynomial of order $O(g^2 i^2)$. We also obtain restrictions on the decomposition of the homology of $\overline M_{g,n}$ into irreducible $S_n$ representations.;math.AG
1801.03895;On Locally Decodable Index Codes;Index coding achieves bandwidth savings by jointly encoding the messages demanded by all the clients in a broadcast channel. The encoding is performed in such a way that each client can retrieve its demanded message from its side information and the broadcast codeword. In general, in order to decode its demanded message symbol, a receiver may have to observe the entire transmitted codeword. Querying or downloading the codeword symbols might involve costs to a client -- such as network utilization costs and storage requirements for the queried symbols to perform decoding. In traditional index coding solutions, this 'client aware' perspective is not considered during code design. As a result, for these codes, the number of codeword symbols queried by a client per decoded message symbol, which we refer to as 'locality', could be large. In this paper, considering locality as a cost parameter, we view index coding as a trade-off between the achievable broadcast rate (codeword length normalized by the message length) and locality, where the objective is to minimize the broadcast rate for a given value of locality and vice versa. We show that the smallest possible locality for any index coding problem is 1, and that the optimal index coding solution with locality 1 is the coding scheme based on fractional coloring of the interference graph. We propose index coding schemes with small locality by covering the side information graph using acyclic subgraphs and subgraphs with small minrank. We also show how locality can be accounted for in conventional partition multicast and cycle covering solutions to index coding. Finally, applying these new techniques, we characterize the locality-broadcast rate trade-off of the index coding problem whose side information graph is the directed 3-cycle.;cs.IT
1801.03908;Homogeneous length functions on groups;A pseudo-length function defined on an arbitrary group $G = (G,\cdot,e, (\,)^{-1})$ is a map $\ell: G \to [0,+\infty)$ obeying $\ell(e)=0$, the symmetry property $\ell(x^{-1}) = \ell(x)$, and the triangle inequality $\ell(xy) \leqslant \ell(x) + \ell(y)$ for all $x,y \in G$. We consider pseudo-length functions which saturate the triangle inequality whenever $x=y$, or equivalently those that are homogeneous in the sense that $\ell(x^n) = n\,\ell(x)$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$. We show that this implies that $\ell([x,y])=0$ for all $x,y \in G$. This leads to a classification of such pseudo-length functions as pullbacks from embeddings into a Banach space. We also obtain a quantitative version of our main result which allows for defects in the triangle inequality or the homogeneity property.;math.GR

We give a self-contained treatment of Fock and Goncharov's description of the moduli space of framed marked properly convex projective structures with minimal or maximal ends, and deduce results of Marquis and Goldman as consequences. We also discuss the Poisson structure on moduli space and its relationship to Goldman's Poisson structure on the character variety.;math.GT
1801.03914;$L^1$ semigroup generation for Fokker-Planck operators associated with general L&#xe9,vy driven SDEs;We prove a new generation result in $L^1$ for a large class of non-local operators with non-degenerate local terms. This class contains the operators appearing in Fokker-Planck or Kolmogorov forward equations associated with L\'evy driven SDEs, i.e. the adjoint operators of the infinitesimal generators of these SDEs. As a byproduct, we also obtain a new elliptic regularity result of independent interest. The main novelty in this paper is that we can consider very general L\'evy operators, including state-space depending coefficients with linear growth and general L\'evy measures which can be singular and have fat tails.;math.DS
1801.03920;Inner Bound for the Capacity Region of Noisy Channels with an Authentication Requirement;The rate regions of many variations of the standard and wire-tap channels have been thoroughly explored. Secrecy capacity characterizes the loss of rate required to ensure that the adversary gains no information about the transmissions. Authentication does not have a standard metric, despite being an important counterpart to secrecy. While some results have taken an information-theoretic approach to the problem of authentication coding, the full rate region and accompanying trade-offs have yet to be characterized. In this paper, we provide an inner bound of achievable rates with an average authentication and reliability constraint. The bound is established by combining and analyzing two existing authentication schemes for both noisy and noiseless channels. We find that our coding scheme improves upon existing schemes.;cs.IT
1801.03925;A Note on a Fourier Expansion of Automorphic Functions that Nontrivially Involves the Euclidean Algorithm;We extend the Fourier expansion of automorphic functions of Piateski-Shapiro and Shalika in a way that the Euclidean algorithm appears nontrivially. Then, we discuss a potential application in the Rankin-Selberg method.;math.NT
1801.03930;A substructuring preconditioner with vertex-related interface solvers for elliptic-type equations in three dimensions;In this paper we propose a variant of the substructuring preconditioner for solving three-dimensional elliptic-type equations with strongly discontinuous coefficients. In the proposed preconditioner, we use the simplest coarse solver associated with the finite element space induced by the coarse partition, and construct vertex-related inexact interface solvers based on overlapping domain decomposition with small overlaps. This new preconditioner has an important merit: its construction and efficiency do not depend on the concrete form of the considered elliptic-type equations. % in the sense that they not only are cheap but also are easy to implement. We apply the proposed preconditioner to solve the linear elasticity problems and Maxwell's equations in three dimensions. Numerical results show that the convergence rate of PCG method with the preconditioner is nearly optimal, and also robust with respect to the (possibly large) jumps of the coefficients in the considered equations.;math.NA
1801.03931;New Results on Multilevel Diversity Coding with Secure Regeneration;The problem of multilevel diversity coding with secure regeneration is revisited. Under the assumption that the eavesdropper can access the repair data for all compromised storage nodes, Shao el al. provided a precise characterization of the minimum-bandwidth-regeneration (MBR) point of the achievable normalized storage-capacity repair-bandwidth tradeoff region. In this paper, it is shown that the MBR point of the achievable normalized storage-capacity repair-bandwidth tradeoff region remains the same even if we assume that the eavesdropper can access the repair data for some compromised storage nodes (type 2 compromised nodes) but only the data contents of the remaining compromised nodes (type 1 compromised nodes), as long as the number of type 1 compromised nodes is no greater than that of type 2 compromised nodes.;cs.IT
1801.03932;Extremals for the Singular Moser-Trudinger Inequality via n-Harmonic Transplantation;The Moser-Trudinger embedding has been generalized in [Adimurthi A., Sandeep K., A singular Moser-Trudinger embedding and its applications, \textit{NoDEA Nonlinear Differential Equations Appl.}, 13 (2007), no. 5-6, 585--603] to the following weighted version: if $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ is bounded, $\omega_{n-1}$ is the $\mathcal{H}^{n-1}$ measure of the unit sphere, then for $\alpha&gt,0$ and $\beta\in [0,n)$, $$ <br />\sup_{u\in\mathcal{B}_1}\int_{\Omega}\frac{e^{\alpha |u|^{n/(n-1)}}}{|x|^{\beta}}\leq C \ \Leftrightarrow \ \frac{\alpha}{\alpha_n}+\frac{\beta}{n}\leq1,\qquad $$ where $\alpha_n=n\cnn$ and $\mathcal{B}_1 = \left\{ u \in W_0^{1, n}(\Omega) \ | \ \int_{\Omega} |\nabla u |^n \leq1 \right\}$. We prove that the supremum is attained on any domain $\Omega$. The paper also fills in the gaps in the proof of [Lin K.C., Extremal functions for Moser's inequality, \textit{Trans. of. Am. Math. Soc.}, 384 (1996), 2663--2671], which deals with the case $\beta=0.$;math.AP
1801.03951;LDPC Codes with Local and Global Decoding;This paper presents a theoretical study of a new type of LDPC codes motivated by practical storage applications. LDPCL codes (suffix L represents locality) are LDPC codes that can be decoded either as usual over the full code block, or locally when a smaller sub-block is accessed (to reduce latency). LDPCL codes are designed to maximize the error-correction performance vs. rate in the usual (global) mode, while at the same time providing a certain performance in the local mode. We develop a theoretical framework for the design of LDPCL codes. Our results include a design tool to construct an LDPC code with two data-protection levels: local and global. We derive theoretical results supporting this tool and we show how to achieve capacity with it. A trade-off between the gap to capacity and the number of full-block accesses is studied, and a finite-length analysis of ML decoding is performed to exemplify a trade-off between the locality capability and the full-block error-correcting capability.;cs.IT
1801.03958;Sheaves on the alcoves and modular representations II;We relate the category of sheaves on alcoves that was constructed in "Sheaves on the alcoves and modular representations I" to the representation theory of reductive algebraic groups. In particular, we show that its indecomposable projective objects encode the simple rational characters of a reductive algebraic group in all characteristics above the Coxeter number.;math.RT
1801.03959;Sheaves on the alcoves and modular representations I;We consider the set of affine alcoves associated with a root system R as a topological space and consider a certain category S of sheaves of Z-modules on this space. Here Z is the structure algebra of the root system over a field k. To any wall reflection we associate a wall crossing functor on S. In the companion article "Sheaves on the alcoves and modular representations II" we prove that S encodes the simple rational characters of the connected, simply connected algebraic group with root system R over k, in the case that k is algebraically closed with characteristic above the Coxeter number.;math.RT
1801.03961;Harnack inequality for a class of Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck equations in non-divergence form;We prove invariant Harnack inequalities for certain classes of non-divergence form equations of Kolmogorov type. The operators we consider exhibit invariance properties with respect to a homogeneous Lie group structure. The coefficient matrix is assumed either to satisfy a Cordes-Landis condition on the eigenvalues, or to admit a uniform modulus of continuity.;math.AP
1801.03964;Resolvability on Continuous Alphabets;We characterize the resolvability region for a large class of point-to-point channels with continuous alphabets. In our direct result, we prove not only the existence of good resolvability codebooks, but adapt an approach based on the Chernoff-Hoeffding bound to the continuous case showing that the probability of drawing an unsuitable codebook is doubly exponentially small. For the converse part, we show that our previous elementary result carries over to the continuous case easily under some mild continuity assumption.;cs.IT
1801.03969;Discrete Hodge star operator on 3-manifolds;Scott Wilson introduced the notion of combinatorial Hodge star operators on a compact oriented triangulated manifold $M$, which act on the singular cohomology ring of $M$. Such an operator depends on both a triangulation $\mathscr K$ of $M$ and a metric on the simplicial cochain complex of $\mathscr K$. Taking the discrete metric, we arrive at the notion of the discrete Hodge star operator for each pair $(M,\mathscr K)$. We prove, when $M$ is a $3$-manifold, that the discrete Hodge star operators acting on the cuspidal cohomology groups $H^i_\mathrm{cusp}(M,\mathbb Q)$ are independent of $\mathscr K$ for $i=1,2$. As an application, we construct a canonical positive definite symmetric quadratic form on $H^i_\mathrm{cusp}(M,\mathbb Q)$ for $i=1,2$. On the other hand, we will interpret our result from a point of view on the Langlands Program, we provide a supporting evidence for the conjecture of Prasanna and Venkatesh, which predicts a degree-shifting action of a motivic cohomology group on the cohomology ring of an arithmetic group.;math.AT
1801.03972;Extremal $G$-free induced subgraphs of Kneser graphs;The Kneser graph ${\rm KG}_{n,k}$ is a graph whose vertex set is the family of all $k$-subsets of $[n]$ and two vertices are adjacent if their corresponding subsets are disjoint. The classical Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem determines the cardinality and structure of a maximum induced $K_2$-free subgraph in ${\rm KG}_{n,k}$. As a generalization of the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem, Erd\H{o}s proposed a conjecture about the maximum order of an induced $K_{s+1}$-free subgraph of ${\rm KG}_{n,k}$. As the best known result concerning this conjecture, Frankl [Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A, 2013], when $n\geq(2s+1)k-s$, gave an affirmative answer to this conjecture and also determined the structure of such a subgraph. In this paper, generalizing the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem and the Erd{\H o}s matching conjecture, we consider the problem of determining the structure of a maximum family $\mathcal{A}$ for which ${\rm KG}_{n,k}[\mathcal{A}]$ has no subgraph isomorphic to a given graph $G$. In this regard, we determine the size and the structure of such a family provided that $n$ is sufficiently large with respect to $G$ and $k$. Furthermore, for the case $G=K_{1,t}$, we present a Hilton-Milner type theorem regarding above-mentioned problem, which specializes to an improvement of a result by Gerbner et al. [SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, 2012].;math.CO
1801.03975;Timely Status Update in Massive IoT Systems: Decentralized Scheduling for Wireless Uplinks;In a typical Internet of Things (IoT) application where a central controller collects status updates from multiple terminals, e.g., sensors and monitors, through a wireless multiaccess uplink, an important problem is how to attain timely status updates autonomously. In this paper, the timeliness of the status is measured by the recently proposed age-of-information (AoI) metric, both the theoretical and practical aspects of the problem are investigated: we aim to obtain a scheduling policy with minimum AoI and, meanwhile, still suitable for decentralized implementation on account of signalling exchange overhead. Towards this end, we first consider the set of arrival-independent and renewal (AIR) policies, the optimal policy thereof to minimize the time-average AoI is proved to be a round-robin policy with one-packet (latest packet only and others are dropped) buffers (RR-ONE). The optimality is established based on a generalized Poisson-arrival-see-time-average (PASTA) theorem. It is further proved that RR-ONE is asymptotically optimal among all policies in the massive IoT regime. The AoI steady-state stationary distribution under RR-ONE is also derived. A fully decentralized implementation of RR-ONE is proposed which can accommodate dynamic terminal appearances. In addition, considering scenarios where packets cannot be dropped, the optimal AIR policy thereof is also found with parameters given by the solution to a convex problem.;cs.IT
1801.03982;Zeta-regularization and the heat-trace on some compact quantum semigroups;Heat-invariants are a class of spectral invariants of Laplace-type operators on compact Riemannian manifolds that contain information about the geometry of the manifold, e.g., the metric and connection. Since Brownian motion solves the heat equation, these invariants can be obtained studying Brownian motion on manifolds. In this article, we consider Brownian motion on the Toeplitz algebra, discrete Heisenberg group algebras, and non-commutative tori to define Laplace-type operators and heat-semigroups on these C*-bialgebras. We show that their traces can be $\zeta$-regularized and compute "heat-traces" on these algebras, giving us a notion of dimension and volume. Furthermore, we consider $SU_q(2)$ which does not have a Brownian motion but a class of driftless Gaussians which still recover the dimension of $SU_q(2)$.;math.OA
1801.03985;On the roots of Wiener polynomials of graphs;The Wiener polynomial of a connected graph $G$ is defined as $W(G,x)=\sum x^{d(u,v)}$, where $d(u,v)$ denotes the distance between $u$ and $v$, and the sum is taken over all unordered pairs of distinct vertices of $G$. We examine the nature and location of the roots of Wiener polynomials of graphs, and in particular trees. We show that while the maximum modulus among all roots of Wiener polynomials of graphs of order $n$ is $\binom{n}{2}-1$, the maximum modulus among all roots of Wiener polynomials of trees of order $n$ grows linearly in $n$. We prove that the closure of the collection of real roots of Wiener polynomials of all graphs is precisely $(-\infty, 0]$, while in the case of trees, it contains $(-\infty, -1]$. Finally, we demonstrate that the imaginary parts and (positive) real parts of roots of Wiener polynomials can be arbitrarily large.;math.CO
1801.03987;Asymptotics for the Ginzburg-Landau equation on manifolds with boundary under homogeneous Neumann condition;On a compact manifold $M^{n}$ ($n\geq 3$) with boundary, we study the asymptotic behavior as $\epsilon$ tends to zero of solutions $u_{\epsilon}: M \to \mathbb{C}$ to the equation $\Delta u_{\epsilon} + \epsilon^{-2}(1 - |u_{\epsilon}|^{2})u_{\epsilon} = 0$ with the boundary condition $\partial_{\nu}u_{\epsilon} = 0$ on $\partial M$. Assuming an energy upper bound on the solutions and a convexity condition on $\partial M$, we show that along a subsequence, the energy of $\{u_{\epsilon}\}$ breaks into two parts: one captured by a harmonic $1$-form $\psi$ on $M$, and the other concentrating on the support of a rectifiable $(n-2)$-varifold $V$ which is stationary with respect to deformations preserving $\partial M$. Examples are given which shows that $V$ could vanish altogether, or be non-zero but supported only on $\partial M$.;math.AP

Voiculescu proved that every separable unital sub-C*-algebra of the Calkin algebra is equal to its (relative) bicommutant. In his minicourse (see reference), G. Pedersen asked in 1988 if Voiculescu's theorem can be extended to a simple corona algebra of a $\sigma$-unital C*-algebra. In this note, we answer Pedersen's question for a stable $\sigma$-unital C*-algebra.;math.OA

1801.04001;Efficient C-RAN Random Access for IoT Devices: Learning Links via Recommendation Systems;We focus on C-RAN random access protocols for IoT devices that yield low-latency high-rate active-device detection in dense networks of large-array remote radio heads. In this context, we study the problem of learning the strengths of links between detected devices and network sites. In particular, we develop recommendation-system inspired algorithms, which exploit random-access observations collected across the network to classify links between active devices and network sites across the network. Our simulations and analysis reveal the potential merit of data-driven schemes for such on-the-fly link classification and subsequent resource allocation across a wide-area network.;cs.IT

1801.04003;Some techniques in density estimation;Density estimation is an interdisciplinary topic at the intersection of statistics, theoretical computer science and machine learning. We review some old and new techniques for bounding the sample complexity of estimating densities of continuous distributions, focusing on the class of mixtures of Gaussians and its subclasses. In particular, we review the main techniques used to prove the new sample complexity bounds for mixtures of Gaussians by Ashtiani, Ben-David, Harvey, Liaw, Mehrabian, and Plan <a href="/abs/1710.05209">arXiv:1710.05209</a>.;math.ST
1801.04005;Minimax Optimality of Sign Test for Paired Heterogeneous Data;Comparing two groups under different conditions is ubiquitous in the biomedical sciences. In many cases, samples from the two groups can be naturally paired, for example a pair of samples may come from the same individual under the two conditions. However samples across different individuals may be highly heterogeneous. Traditional methods often ignore such heterogeneity by assuming the samples are identically distributed. In this work, we study the problem of comparing paired heterogeneous data by modeling the data as Gaussian distributed with different parameters across the samples. We show that in the minimax setting where we want to maximize the worst-case power, the sign test, which only uses the signs of the differences between the paired sample, is optimal in the one-sided case and near optimal in the two-sided case. The superiority of the sign test over other popular tests for paired heterogeneous data is demonstrated using both synthetic data and a real-world RNA-Seq dataset.;math.ST
1801.04009;$C^1$ actions on manifolds by lattices in Lie groups;In this paper we study Zimmer's conjecture for $C^1$ actions of lattice subgroup of a higher-rank simple Lie group with finite center on compact manifolds. We show that when the rank of the lattice is larger than the dimension of the manifold, then the action factors through a finite group. In particular, we prove Zimmer's conjecture for $C^1$ actions of lattices in $SL(n, \R)$.;math.DS
1801.04010;Adaptive Bit Allocation for OFDM Cognitive Radio Systems with Imperfect Channel Estimation;Cognitive radios hold tremendous promise for increasing the spectral efficiency of wireless communication systems. In this paper, an adaptive bit allocation algorithm is presented for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) CR systems operating in a frequency selective fading environment. The algorithm maximizes the CR system throughput in the presence of narrowband interference, while guaranteeing a BER below a predefined threshold. The effect of imperfect channel estimation on the algorithm's performance is also studied.;cs.IT
1801.04020;An explicit correspondence of modular curves;In this paper, we recall an alternative proof of Merel's conjecture which asserts that a certain explicit correspondence gives the isogeny relation between the Jacobians associated to the normalizer of split and non-split Cartan subgroups. This alternative proof does not require extensive representation theory and can be formulated in terms of certain finite geometries modulo $\ell$. <br />Secondly, we generalize these arguments to exhibit an explicit correspondence which gives the isogeny relation between the Jacobians associated to split and non-split Cartan subgroups. An interesting feature is that the required explicit correspondence is considerably more complicated but can expressed as a certain linear combination of double coset operators whose coefficients we are able to make explicit.;math.NT
1801.04021;Analyticity of Resonances and Eigenvalues and Spectral Properties of the massless Spin-Boson Model;We extend the method of multiscale analysis for resonances introduced in [5] in order to infer analytic properties of resonances and eigenvalues (and their eigenprojections) as well as estimates for the localization of the spectrum of dilated Hamiltonians and norm-bounds for the corresponding resolvent operators, in neighborhoods of resonances and eigenvalues. We apply our method to the massless Spin-Boson model assuming a slight infrared regularization. We prove that the resonance and the ground-state eigenvalue (and their eigenprojections) are analytic with respect to the dilation parameter and the coupling constant. Moreover, we prove that the spectrum of the dilated Spin-Boson Hamiltonian in the neighborhood of the resonance and the ground-state eigenvalue is localized in two cones in the complex plane with vertices at the location of the resonance and the ground-state eigenvalue, respectively. Additionally, we provide norm-estimates for the resolvent of the dilated Spin-Boson Hamiltonian near the resonance and the ground-state eigenvalue. The topic of analyticity of eigenvalues and resonances has let to several studies and advances in the past. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that it is addressed from the perspective of multiscale analysis. Once the multiscale analysis is set up our method gives easy access to analyticity: Essentially, it amounts to proving it for isolated eigenvalues only and use that uniform limits of analytic functions are analytic. The type of spectral and resolvent estimates that we prove are needed to control the time evolution including the scattering regime. The latter will be demonstrated in a forthcoming publication. The introduced multiscale method to study spectral and resolvent estimates follows its own inductive scheme and is independent (and different) from the method we apply to construct resonances.;math-ph
1801.04022;Cognitive Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access with Cooperative Relaying: A New Wireless Frontier for 5G Spectrum Sharing;Two emerging technologies towards 5G wireless networks, namely non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and cognitive radio (CR), will provide more efficient utilization of wireless spectrum in the future. In this article, we investigate the integration of NOMA with CR into a holistic system, namely cognitive NOMA network, for more intelligent spectrum sharing. Design principles of cognitive NOMA networks are perfectly aligned to functionality requirements of 5G wireless networks, such as high spectrum efficiency, massive connectivity, low latency, and better fairness. Three different cognitive NOMA architectures are presented, including underlay NOMA networks, overlay NOMA networks, and CR-inspired NOMA networks. To address inter- and intra-network interference which largely degrade the performance of cognitive NOMA networks, cooperative relaying strategies are proposed. For each cognitive NOMA architecture, our proposed cooperative relaying strategy shows its potential to significantly lower outage probabilities. Furthermore, we discuss open challenges and future research directions on implementation of cognitive NOMA networks.;cs.IT
1801.04023;Relations in the cohomology ring of the moduli space of flat $SO(2n+1)$-connections on a Riemann surface;We consider the moduli space of flat $SO(2n+1)$-connections (up to gauge transformations) on a Riemann surface, with fixed holonomy around a marked point. There are natural line bundles over this moduli space, we construct geometric representatives for the Chern classes of these line bundles, and prove that the ring generated by these Chern classes vanishes below the dimension of the moduli space, generalising a conjecture of Newstead.;math.DG
1801.04024;Strong amenability and the infinite conjugacy class property;A group is said to be strongly amenable if each of its proximal topological actions has a fixed point.

More generally, a countable discrete group is strongly amenable if and only if none of its quotients have the infinite conjugacy class property.;math.GR
1801.04027;A New Continuum-Based Thick Shell Finite Element for Soft Biological Tissues in Dynamics: Part 2 - Anisotropic Hyperelasticity and Incompressibility Aspects;In a companion article (Part 1), we presented the development of a thick continuum-based (CB) shell finite element (FE) based on Mindlin-Reissner theory. We verified the accuracy, efficiency and locking insensitivity of the element in modeling large 3D deformations, using linear elastic material properties. In the present article, we developed and implemented the kinetics description, within the updated Lagrangian (UL) formulation, of anisotropic incompressible hyperelastic constitutive relations that enable the CB shell FE to accurately model very large 3D strains and deformations. Specifically, we developed the measures of deformation in the lamina coordinate system, presented three techniques to model nonlinear hyperelastic strains, and enabled the direct enforcement of incompressibility and of the zero normal stress condition without using a penalty factor or a Lagrange multiplier. Moving towards the application of the present work to the biomedical realm, we performed multiple experiments concerning mechanical behavior of rubber-like materials and soft biological tissues in different geometries and loading conditions. Excellent agreements between the present FE results and the analytical and/or experimental data proved the CB shell FE combined with the present constitutive techniques to be a highly reliable and efficient tool for modeling, analyzing, and predicting mechanical behavior of soft biological tissues.;math.NA
1801.04029;A New Continuum-Based Thick Shell Finite Element for Soft Biological Tissues in Dynamics: Part 1 - Preliminary Benchmarking Using Classic Verification Experiments;For the finite element simulation of thin soft biological tissues in dynamics, shell elements, compared to volume elements, can capture the whole tissue thickness at once, and feature larger critical time steps. However, the capabilities of existing shell elements to account for irregular geometries, and hyperelastic, anisotropic 3D deformations characteristic of soft tissues are still limited. As improvement, we developed a new general nonlinear thick continuum-based (CB) shell finite element (FE) based on the Mindlin-Reissner shell theory, with large bending, large distortion and large strain capabilities, embedded in the updated Lagrangian formulation and explicit time integration. We performed numerical benchmark experiments available from the literature that focus on engineering linear elastic materials, which, verified and proved the new thick CB shell FE to: 1) be accurate an efficient 2) be powerful in handling large 3D deformations, curved geometries, 3) accommodate coarse distorted meshes, and 4) achieve comparatively fast computational times. The new element was also insensitive to three types of locking (shear, membrane and volumetric), and warping effects. The capabilities of the present thick CB shell FE in the biomedical realm are illustrated in a companion article (Part 2), in which anisotropic incompressible hyperelastic constitutive relations are implemented and verified.;math.NA

As an analogue to the double slice genus, we also define the superslice genus of a knot, and give both an upper bound and a lower bound in the topological category.;math.GT

The existing coding scheme is simplified in two steps by replacing Wyner secrecy coding with Carleial-Hellman secrecy coding. The resulting simplified scheme is free from redundant message splits and random components. Not least, the simplified scheme retains the existing achievable individual secrecy rate region. Finally, its construction simplicity helps us gain additional insight on the integration of secrecy techniques into error-correcting coding schemes.;cs.IT
1801.04034;Hausdorff dimension of Kuperberg minimal sets;In 1994, Kuperberg constructed a smooth flow on a three-manifold with no periodic orbits.

We develop new techniques to study the symbolic dynamics and dimension theory of this minimal set, by relating it to the limit set of a graph directed pseudo-Markov system over a countable alphabet.;math.DS
1801.04037;Weakly singular corners always scatter;Assume that a bounded scatterer is embedded into an infinite homogeneous isotropic background medium in two dimensions. The refractive index function is supposed to be piecewise constant. If the scattering interface contains a weakly or strongly singular point, we prove that the scattered field cannot vanish identically. This particularly leads to the absence of non-scattering energies for piecewise analytic interfaces with a weakly singular point. Local uniqueness is obtained for shape identification problems in inverse medium scattering with a single far-field pattern.;math.AP
1801.04039;Sequential derivatives;Consider a real valued function defined, but not differentiable at some point. We use sequences approaching the point of interest to define and study sequential concepts of secant and cord derivatives of the function at the point of interest.

1801.04044;Wigner functions on non-standard symplectic vector spaces;We consider the Weyl quantization on a flat non-standard symplectic vector space. We focus mainly on the properties of the Wigner functions defined therein. In particular we show that the sets of Wigner functions on distinct symplectic spaces are different but have non-empty intersections. This extends previous results to arbitrary dimension and arbitrary (constant) symplectic structure. As a by-product we introduce and prove several concepts and results on non-standard symplectic spaces which generalize those on the standard symplectic space, namely the symplectic spectrum, Williamson's theorem and Narcowich-Wigner spectra. We also show how Wigner functions on non-standard symplectic spaces behave under the action of an arbitrary linear coordinate transformation.;math-ph
1801.04050;Communication Optimality Trade-offs For Distributed Estimation;This paper proposes $\mathbf{C}$ommunication efficient $\mathbf{RE}$cursive $\mathbf{D}$istributed estimati$\mathbf{O}$n algorithm, $\mathcal{CREDO}$, for networked multi-worker setups without a central master node. $\mathcal{CREDO}$ is designed for scenarios in which the worker nodes aim to collaboratively estimate a vector parameter of interest using distributed online time-series data at the individual worker nodes. The individual worker nodes iteratively update their estimate of the parameter by assimilating latest locally sensed information and estimates from neighboring worker nodes exchanged over a (possibly sparse) time-varying communication graph. The underlying inter-worker communication protocol is adaptive, making communications increasingly (probabilistically) sparse as time progresses. Under minimal conditions on the inter-worker information exchange network and the sensing models, almost sure convergence of the estimate sequences at the worker nodes to the true parameter is established. Further, the paper characterizes the performance of $\mathcal{CREDO}$ in terms of asymptotic covariance of the estimate sequences and specifically establishes the achievability of optimal asymptotic covariance. The analysis reveals an interesting interplay between the algorithm's communication cost~$\mathcal{C}_{t}$ (over $t$ time-steps) and the asymptotic covariance. Most notably, it is shown that $\mathcal{CREDO}$ may be designed to achieve a $\Theta\left(\mathcal{C}_{t}^{-2+\zeta}\right)$ decay of the mean square error~($\zeta&gt,0$, arbitrarily small) at each worker node, which significantly improves over the existing $ \Theta\left(\mathcal{C}_{t}^{-1}\right)$ rates. Simulation examples on both synthetic and real data sets demonstrate $\mathcal{CREDO}$'s communication efficiency.;math.OC
1801.04063;How Many Samples Required in Big Data Collection: A Differential Message Importance Measure;Information collection is a fundamental problem in big data, where the size of sampling sets plays a very important role. This work considers the information collection process by taking message importance into account. Similar to differential entropy, we define differential message importance measure (DMIM) as a measure of message importance for continuous random variable. It is proved that the change of DMIM can describe the gap between the distribution of a set of sample values and a theoretical distribution. In fact, the deviation of DMIM is equivalent to Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, but it offers a new way to characterize the distribution goodness-of-fit. Numerical results show some basic properties of DMIM and the accuracy of the proposed approximate values. Furthermore, it is also obtained that the empirical distribution approaches the real distribution with decreasing of the DMIM deviation, which contributes to the selection of suitable sampling points in actual system.;cs.IT
1801.04064;State Variation Mining: On Information Divergence with Message Importance in Big Data;Information transfer which reveals the state variation of variables usually plays a vital role in big data analytics and processing. In fact, the measures for information transfer could reflect the system change by use of the variable distributions, similar to KL divergence and Renyi divergence. Furthermore, in terms of the information transfer in big data, small probability events usually dominate the importance of the total message to some degree. Therefore, it is significant to design an information transfer measure based on the message importance which emphasizes the small probability events. In this paper, we propose a message importance transfer measure (MITM) and investigate its characteristics and applications on three aspects. First, the message importance transfer capacity based on MITM is presented to offer an upper bound for the information transfer process with disturbance. Then, we extend the MITM to the continuous case and discuss the robustness by using it to measuring information distance. Finally, we utilize the MITM to guide the queue length selection in the caching operation of mobile edge computing.;cs.IT
1801.04067;Content Based Status Updates;Consider a stream of status updates generated by a source, where each update is of one of two types: high priority or ordinary (low priority). These updates are to be transmitted through a network to a monitor. However, the transmission policy of each packet depends on the type of stream it belongs to. For the low priority stream, we analyze and compare the performances of two transmission schemes: (i) Ordinary updates are served in a First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) fashion, whereas, in (ii), the ordinary updates are transmitted according to an M/G/1/1 with preemption policy. In both schemes, high priority updates are transmitted according to an M/G/1/1 with preemption policy and receive preferential treatment. An arriving priority update discards and replaces any currently-in-service high priority update, and preempts (with eventual resume for scheme (i)) any ordinary update. We model the arrival processes of the two kinds of updates, in both schemes, as independent Poisson processes. For scheme (i), we find the arrival and service rates under which the system is stable and give closed-form expressions for average peak age and a lower bound on the average age of the ordinary stream. For scheme (ii), we derive closed-form expressions for the average age and average peak age of the high priority and low priority streams. We finally show that, if the service time is exponentially distributed, the M/M/1/1 with preemption policy leads to an average age of the low priority stream higher than the one achieved using the FCFS scheme. Therefore, the M/M//1/1 with preemption policy, when applied on the low priority stream of updates and in the presence of a higher priority scheme, is not anymore the optimal transmission policy from an age point of view.;cs.IT
1801.04068;Status Updates in a multi-stream M/G/1/1 preemptive queue;We consider a source that collects a multiplicity of streams of updates and sends them through a network to a monitor. However, only a single update can be in the system at a time. Therefore, the transmitter always preempts the packet being served when a new update is generated. We consider Poisson arrivals for each stream and a common general service time, and refer to this system as the multi-stream M/G/1/1 queue with preemption. Using the detour flow graph method, we compute a closed form expression for the average age and the average peak age of each stream. Moreover, we deduce that although all streams are treated equally from a transmission point of view (they all preempt each other), one can still prioritize a stream from an age point of view by simply increasing its generation rate. However, this will increase the sum of the ages which is minimized when all streams have the same update rate.;cs.IT
1801.04070;A Fast Algorithm with Error Bounds for Quadrature by Expansion;Quadrature by Expansion (QBX) is a quadrature method for approximating the value of the singular integrals encountered in the evaluation of layer potentials. It exploits the smoothness of the layer potential by forming locally-valid expansion which are then evaluated to compute the near or on-surface value of the integral. Recent work towards coupling of a Fast Multipole Method (FMM) to QBX yielded a first step towards the rapid evaluation of such integrals (and the solution of related integral equations), albeit with only empirically understood error behavior. In this paper, we improve upon this approach with a modified algorithm for which we give a comprehensive analysis of error and cost in the case of the Laplace equation in two dimensions. For the same levels of (user-specified) accuracy, the new algorithm empirically has cost-per-accuracy comparable to prior approaches. We provide experimental results to demonstrate scalability and numerical accuracy.;math.NA
1801.04072;Controller Synthesis for Safety of Physically-Viable Data-Driven Models;We consider the problem of designing finite-horizon safe controllers for a dynamical system for which no explicit analytical model exists and limited data only along a single trajectory of the system are available. Given samples of the states and inputs of the system, and additional side information in terms of regularity of the evolution of the states and conservation laws, we synthesize a controller such that the evolution of the states avoid some pre-specified unsafe set over a given finite horizon. Motivated by recent results on Whitney's extension theorem, we use piecewise-polynomial approximations of the trajectories based on the data along with the regularity side information to formulate a data-driven differential inclusion model that can predict the evolution of the trajectories. For these classes of data- driven differential inclusions, we propose a safety analysis theorem based on barrier certificates. As a corollary of this theorem, we demonstrate that we can design controllers ensuring safety of the solutions to the data-driven differential inclusion over a finite horizon. From a computational standpoint, our results are cast into a set of sum-of-squares programs whenever the certificates are parametrized by polynomials of fixed degree and the sets are semi-algebraic. This computational method allows incorporating side information in terms of conservation laws and integral constraints using Positivstellensatz-type arguments.;math.OC
1801.04075;Laplace, Residue, and Euler integral representations of GKZ hypergeometric functions;We consider four types of representations of solutions of GKZ system: series representations, Laplace integral representations, Euler integral representations, and Residue integral representations which will be introduced in this paper. In the former half of this paper, we provide a method for constructing integration cycles for Laplace, Residue, and Euler integral representations and relate them to series representations. In the latter half, we reformulate our integral representations in terms of direct images of $D$-modules and show their equivalence.;math.CA
1801.04077;Optimal control of an evolution equation with non-smooth dissipation;In the present work we study the optimal control of an evolution equation with non-smooth dissipation. The solution mapping of this system is non-smooth and hence the analysis is quite challenging. Our approach is to regularize the dissipation via approximation by a smooth function. We derive optimality conditions for the corresponding smooth optimal control problem. Then we drive the regularization parameter to zero and obtain necessary optimality conditions for the original non-smooth problem. However, in this process we lose regularity of the adjoint variables.;math.OC
1801.04079;On asymptotic stability of ground states of some systems of nonlinear Schr&#xf6,dinger equations;We extend to a specific class of systems of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (NLS) the theory of asymptotic stability of ground states already proved for the scalar NLS. Here the key point is the choice of an adequate system of modulation coordinates and the novelty, compared to the scalar NLS, is the fact that the group of symmetries of the system is non-commutative.;math.AP
1801.04086;Maximal and typical nonnegative ranks of nonnegative tensors;Let $N_1, \ldots, N_d$ be positive integers with $N_1\leq\cdots\leq N_d$. Set $N=N_1\cdots N_{d-1}$. We show in this paper that an integer $r$ is a typical nonnegative rank of nonnegative tensors of format $N_1\times\cdots\times N_d$ if and only if $r\leq N$ and $r$ is greater than or equals to the generic rank of tensors over $\mathbb{C}$ of format $N_1\times\cdots\times N_d$. We also show that the maximal nonnegative rank of nonnegative tensors of format $N_1\times\cdots\times N_d$ is $N$.;math.RA
1801.04088;Non self-adjoint laplacians on a directed graph;We consider a non self-adjoint Laplacian on a directed graph with non symmetric edge weights. We analyse spectral properties of this Laplacian under a Kirchhoff assumption. Moreover we establish isoperimet-ric inequalities in terms of the numerical range to show the absence of the essential spectrum of the Laplacian on heavy end directed graphs.;math.SP
1801.04090;On notions of Q-independence and Q-identical distributiveness;In a recent article A.M. Kagan and G.J.Sz\'ekely introduced a notion of Q-independent and Q-identical distributed random variables. We give a complete description of polynomials which appear in these definitions.;math.PR
1801.04091;Multivariate stochastic delay differential equations and CAR representations of CARMA processes;In this study we show how to represent a continuous time autoregressive moving average (CARMA) as a higher order stochastic delay differential equation, which may be thought of as a continuous-time equivalent of the AR($\infty$) representation. Furthermore, we show how this representation gives rise to a prediction formula for CARMA processes. To be used in the above mentioned results we develop a general theory for multivariate stochastic delay differential equations, which will be of independent interest, and which will have particular focus on existence, uniqueness and representations.;math.PR
1801.04094;Infinite Families of Equivariantly Formal Toric Orbifolds;The simplicial wedge construction on simplicial complexes and simple polytopes has been used by a variety of authors to study toric and related spaces, including non-singular toric varieties, toric manifolds, intersections of quadrics and more generally, polyhedral products. In this paper we extend the analysis to include toric orbifolds. Our main results yield infinite families of toric orbifolds, derived from a given one, whose integral cohomology is free of torsion and is concentrated in even degrees, a property which might be termed \emph{integrally equivariantly formal}. In all cases, it is possible to give a description of the cohomology ring and to relate it to the cohomology of the original orbifold.;math.AT
1801.04095;Sensitivity indices for independent groups of variables;In this paper, we study sensitivity indices for independent groups of variables and we look at the particular case of block-additive models. We show in this case that most of the Sobol indices are equal to zero and that Shapley effects can be estimated more efficiently. We then apply this study to Gaussian linear models, and we provide an efficient algorithm to compute the theoretical sensitivity indices. In numerical experiments, we show that this algorithm compares favourably to other existing methods. We also use the theoretical results to improve the estimation of the Shapley effects for general models, when the inputs form independent groups of variables.;math.ST
1801.04097;Exceptional and modern intervals of the Tamari lattice;In this article we use the theory of interval-posets recently introduced by Ch{\^a}tel and Pons in order to describe some interesting families of intervals in the Tamari lattices. These families are defined as interval-posets avoiding specific configurations. At first, we consider what we call exceptional interval-posets and show that they correspond to the intervals which are obtained as images of noncrossing trees in the Dendriform operad. We also show that the exceptional intervals are exactly the intervals of the Tamari lattice induced by intervals in the poset of noncrossing partitions. In the second part we introduce the notion of modern and infinitely modern interval-posets. We show that the modern intervals are in bijection with the new intervals of the Tamari lattice in the sense of Chapoton. We deduce an intrinsic characterization of the new intervals in the Tamari lattice. Finally, we consider the family of what we call infinitely modern intervals and we we prove that there are as many infinitely modern interval-posets of size n as there are ternary trees with n inner vertices.;math.CO
1801.04098;Combinatorics of compactified universal Jacobians;We use orientations on stable graphs to express the combinatorial structure of the compactified universal Jacobians in degrees g-1 and g over the moduli space of stable curves, \Mgb, and construct for them graded stratifications compatible with the one of \Mgb. In particular, for a stable curve we exhibit graded stratifications of the compactified Jacobians in terms of totally cyclic, respectively rooted, orientations on subgraphs of its dual graph.;math.AG
1801.04104;Multiple Antennas Secure Transmission under Pilot Spoofing and Jamming Attack;Transmitter-side channel state information (CSI) of the legitimate destination plays a critical role in physical layer secure transmissions. However, channel training procedure is vulnerable to the pilot spoofing attack (PSA) or pilot jamming attack (PJA) by an active eavesdropper (Eve), which inevitably results in severe private information leakage. In this paper, we propose a random channel training (RCT) based secure downlink transmission framework for a time division duplex (TDD) multiple antennas base station (BS). In the proposed RCT scheme, multiple orthogonal pilot sequences (PSs) are simultaneously allocated to the legitimate user (LU), and the LU randomly selects one PS from the assigned PS set to transmit. Under either the PSA or PJA, we provide the detailed steps for the BS to identify the PS transmitted by the LU, and to simultaneously estimate channels of the LU and Eve. The probability that the BS makes an incorrect decision on the PS of the LU is analytically investigated. Finally, closed-form secure beamforming (SB) vectors are designed and optimized to enhance the secrecy rates during the downlink transmissions. Numerical results show that the secrecy performance is greatly improved compared to the conventional channel training scheme wherein only one PS is assigned to the LU.;cs.IT
1801.04106;Perfect codes in generalized Fibonacci cubes;The {\em Fibonacci cube} of dimension $n$, denoted as $\Gamma\_n$, is the subgraph of the $n$-cube $Q\_n$ induced by vertices with no consecutive 1's. In an article of 2016 Ashrafi and his co-authors proved the non-existence of perfect codes in $\Gamma\_n$ for $n\geq 4$. As an open problem the authors suggest to consider the existence of perfect codes in generalization of Fibonacci cubes. The most direct generalization is the family $\Gamma\_n(1^s)$ of subgraphs induced by strings without $1^s$ as a substring where $s\geq 2$ is a given integer. We prove the existence of a perfect code in $\Gamma\_n(1^s)$ for $n=2^p-1$ and $s \geq 3.2^{p-2}$ for any integer $p\geq 2$.;math.CO
1801.04109;Couplings in $L^p$ distance of two Brownian motions and their L{&#xe9,}vy area;We study co-adapted couplings of (canonical hypoelliptic) diffu-sions on the (subRiemannian) Heisenberg group, that we call (Heisenberg) Brow-nian motions and are the joint laws of a planar Brownian motion with its L{\'e}vy area. We show that contrary to the situation observed on Riemannian manifolds of non-negative Ricci curvature, for any co-adapted coupling, two Heisenberg Brownian motions starting at two given points can not stay at bounded distance for all time t $\ge$ 0. Actually, we prove the stronger result that they can not stay bounded in L p for p $\ge$ 2. We also study the coupling by reflection, and show that it stays bounded in L p for 0 $\le$ p &lt, 1. Finally, we explain how the results generalise to the Heisenberg groups of higher dimension;math.PR
1801.04115;A Game Theoretic Approach to Hyperbolic Consensus Problems;We introduce the use of conservation laws to develop strategies in multi-player consensus games. First, basic well posedness results provide a reliable analytic setting. Then, a general non anticipative strategy is proposed through its rigorous analytic definitions and then tested by means of numerical integrations.;math.OC
1801.04121;Supercaloric functions for the porous medium equation;In the slow diffusion case unbounded supersolutions of the porous medium equation are of two totally different types, depending on whether the pressure is locally integrable or not. This criterion and its consequences are discussed.;math.AP
1801.04122;Robust error estimation for lowest-order approximation of nearly incompressible elasticity;We consider so-called Herrmann and Hydrostatic mixed formulations of classical linear elasticity and analyse the error associated with locally stabilised $P_1-P_0$ finite element approximation. First, we prove a stability estimate for the discrete problem and establish an a priori estimate for the associated energy error. Second, we consider a residual-based a posteriori error estimator as well as a local Poisson problem estimator. We establish bounds for the energy error that are independent of the Lam\'{e} coefficients and prove that the estimators are robust in the incompressible limit. A key issue to be addressed is the requirement for pressure stabilisation. Numerical results are presented that validate the theory. The software used is available online.;math.NA
1801.04125;Newton-Okounkov bodies and normal toric degenerations;Anderson proved that the finite generation of the value semigroup $\Gamma_{Y_\bullet}(D)$ in the construction of the Newton-Okounkov body $\Delta_{Y_\bullet}(D)$ induces a toric degeneration of the corresponding variety $X$ to some toric variety $X_0$. In this case the normalization of $X_0$ is the normal toric variety corresponding to the rational polytope $\Delta_{Y_\bullet}(D)$. Since $X_0$ is not normal in general this correspondence is rather implicit. In this article we investigate in conditions to assure that $X_0$ is normal, by comparing the Hilbert polynomial with the Ehrhart polynomial. <br />In the case of del Pezzo surfaces this will result in an algorithm which outputs for a given divisor $D$ a flag $Y_\bullet$ such that the value semigroup in question is indeed normal. Furthermore, we will find flags on del Pezzo surfaces and on some particular weak del Pezzo surfaces which induce normal toric degenerations for all possible divisors at once. We will prove that in this case the global value semigroup $\Gamma_{Y_\bullet}(X)$ is finitely generated and normal.;math.AG
1801.04126;Extending Whitney&#x27,s extension theorem: nonlinear function spaces;This article shows that there is a continuous extension operator for compactly-supported smooth sections of vector bundles on possibly non-compact smooth manifolds, where the closed set to which sections are restricted satisfy a mild restriction on possible boundary cusps. These function spaces are locally convex but in general not Fr\'echet and so one cannot use the existing theory for Fr\'echet spaces of smooth functions. Further, in the global, nonlinear case of all smooth functions between possibly non-compact smooth manifolds, we prove that the analogous restriction map between locally convex manifolds of smooth functions is a submersion in the sense of admitting continuous local splittings on charts, under the assumption the closed set is either a submanifold with corners, or is locally convex with rough boundary and compact. In all these results the spaces of functions are spaces of smooth functions, and not spaces of Whitney jets.;math.DG
1801.04128;Improved bounds on the multicolor Ramsey numbers of paths and even cycles;We study the multicolor Ramsey numbers for paths and even cycles, $R_k(P_n)$ and $R_k(C_n)$, which are the smallest integers $N$ such that every coloring of the complete graph $K_N$ has a monochromatic copy of $P_n$ or $C_n$ respectively. For a long time, $R_k(P_n)$ has only been known to lie between $(k-1+o(1))n$ and $(k + o(1))n$. A recent breakthrough by S\'ark\"ozy and later improvement by Davies, Jenssen and Roberts give an upper bound of $(k - \frac{1}{4} + o(1))n$. We improve the upper bound to $(k - \frac{1}{2}+ o(1))n$. Our approach uses structural insights in connected graphs without a large matching. These insights may be of independent interest.;math.CO
1801.04133;Eigenvalues of Dirichlet Laplacian within the class of open sets with constant diameter;This paper is about a shape optimization problem related to the Dirichlet Laplacian eingevalues in the Euclidean plane. More precisely we study the shape of the minimizer in the class of open sets of constant width. We prove that the disk is not a local minimizer except for a limited number of eigenvalues.;math.SP
1801.04136;First-passage times over moving boundaries for asymptotically stable walks;Let $\{S_n, n\geq1\}$ be a random walk wih independent and identically distributed increments and let $\{g_n,n\geq1\}$ be a sequence of real numbers. Let $T_g$ denote the first time when $S_n$ leaves $(g_n,\infty)$. Assume that the random walk is oscillating and asymptotically stable, that is, there exists a sequence $\{c_n,n\geq1\}$ such that $S_n/c_n$ converges to a stable law. In this paper we determine the tail behaviour of $T_g$ for all oscillating asymptotically stable walks and all boundary sequences satisfying $g_n=o(c_n)$. Furthermore, we prove that the rescaled random walk conditioned to stay above the boundary up to time $n$ converges, as $n\to\infty$, towards the stable meander.;math.PR
1801.04143;Local asymptotic self-similarity for heavy tailed harmonizable fractional L&#xe9,vy motions;In this work we characterize the local asymptotic self-similarity of harmonizable fractional L\'evy motions in the heavy tailed case. The corresponding tangent process is shown to be the harmonizable fractional stable motion. In addition, we provide sufficient conditions for existence of harmonizable fractional L\'evy motions.;math.PR
1801.04144;Second order models for optimal transport and cubic splines on the Wasserstein space;On the space of probability densities, we extend the Wasserstein geodesics to the case of higher-order interpolation such as cubic spline interpolation. After presenting the natural extension of cubic splines to the Wasserstein space, we propose a simpler approach based on the relaxation of the variational problem on the path space. We explore two different numerical approaches, one based on multi-marginal optimal transport and entropic regularization and the other based on semi-discrete optimal transport.;math.OC
1801.04146;Variational Second-Order Interpolation on the Group of Diffeomorphisms with a Right-Invariant Metric;In this note, we propose a variational framework in which the minimization of the acceleration on the group of diffeomorphisms endowed with a right-invariant metric is well-posed. It relies on constraining the acceleration to belong to a Sobolev space of higher-order than the order of the metric in order to gain compactness. It provides the theoretical guarantee of existence of minimizers which is compulsory for numerical simulations.;math.OC
1801.04155;Existence and Multiplicity for elliptic p-Laplacian problems with critical growth in the gradient;We consider the boundary value problem $-\Delta_p u = \lambda c(x) |u|^{p-2}u + \mu(x) |\grad u|^p + h(x)$, $u \in W^{1,p}_0(\Omega) \cap L^{\infty}(\Omega)$, where $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^N$, $N \geq 2$, is a bounded domain with smooth boundary. We assume $c$, $h \in L^q(\Omega)$ for some $q &gt, \max\{N/p,1\}$ with $c \gneqq 0$ and $\mu \in L^{\infty}(\Omega)$. We prove existence and uniqueness results in the coercive case $ \lambda \leq 0$ and existence and multiplicity results in the non-coercive case $ \lambda &gt,0$. Also, considering stronger assumptions on the coefficients, we clarify the structure of the set of solutions in the non-coercive case.;math.AP
1801.04165;On the Termination of the General XL Algorithm and Ordinary Multinomials;The XL algorithm is an algorithm for solving overdetermined systems of multivariate polynomial equations, which was initially introduced for quadratic equations. However, the algorithm works for polynomials of any degree, and in this paper we will focus on the performance of XL for polynomials of degree $\geq3$, where the optimal termination value of the parameter $D$ is still unknown. We prove that the XL algorithm terminates at a certain value of $D$ in the case that the number of equations exceeds the number of variables by 1 or 2. We also give strong evidence that this value is best possible, and we show that this value is smaller than the degree of regularity. Part of our analysis requires proving that ordinary multinomials are strongly unimodal, and this result may be of independent interest.;math.AC
1801.04172;Fast iterative solvers for an optimal transport problem;Optimal transport problems pose many challenges when considering their numerical treatment. We investigate the solution of a PDE-constrained optimisation problem subject to a particular transport equation arising from the modelling of image metamorphosis. We present the nonlinear optimisation problem, and discuss the discretisation and treatment of the nonlinearity via a Gauss--Newton scheme. We then derive preconditioners that can be used to solve the linear systems at the heart of the (Gauss--)Newton method. With the optical flow in mind, we further propose the reduction of dimensionality by choosing a radial basis function discretisation that uses the centres of superpixels as the collocation points. Again, we derive suitable preconditioners that can be used for this formulation.;math.NA
1801.04175;A fast spectral divide-and-conquer method for banded matrices;Based on the spectral divide-and-conquer algorithm by Nakatsukasa and Higham [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 35(3): A1325-A1349, 2013], we propose a new algorithm for computing all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric banded matrix. For this purpose, we combine our previous work on the fast computation of spectral projectors in the so called HODLR format, with a novel technique for extracting a basis for the range of such a HODLR matrix. The numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm exhibits quasilinear complexity and allows for conveniently dealing with large-scale matrices.;math.NA
1801.04176;Non-meagre subgroups of reals disjoint with meagre sets;Let $(X, +)$ denote $(\mathbb{R}, +)$ or $(2^{\omega}, +_2)$. We prove that for any meagre set $F \subseteq X$ there exists a subgroup $G \le X$ without the Baire property, disjoint with some translation of F. We point out several consequences of this fact and indicate why analogous result for the measure cannot be established in ZFC. We extend proof techniques from the work of Ros{\l}anowski and Shelah [1].;math.GN
1801.04178;The affine VW supercategory;We define the affine VW supercategory $\mathit{s}\hspace{-0.7mm}\bigvee\mkern-15mu\bigvee$, which arises from studying the action of the periplectic Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{p}(n)$ on the tensor product $M\otimes V^{\otimes a}$ of an arbitrary representation $M$ with several copies of the vector representation $V$ of $\mathfrak{p}(n)$. It plays a role analogous to that of the degenerate affine Hecke algebras in the context of representations of the general linear group, the main obstacle was the lack of a quadratic Casimir element in $\mathfrak{p}(n)\otimes \mathfrak{p}(n)$. When $M$ is the trivial representation, the action factors through the Brauer supercategory $\mathit{s}\mathcal{B}\mathit{r}$. Our main result is an explicit basis theorem for the morphism spaces of $\mathit{s}\hspace{-0.7mm}\bigvee\mkern-15mu\bigvee$ and, as a consequence, of $\mathit{s}\mathcal{B}\mathit{r}$. The proof utilises the close connection with the representation theory of $\mathfrak{p}(n)$. As an application we explicitly describe the centre of all endomorphism algebras, and show that it behaves well under the passage to the associated graded and under deformation.;math.RT
1801.04182;n-Torsion Clean Rings;Let n be an arbitrary natural number. The class of (strongly) n-torsion clean rings is introduced and investigated. Abelian n-torsion clean rings are somewhat characterized and a complete characterization of strongly n-torsion clean rings is given in the case when n is odd. Some open questions are posed at the end.;math.RA
1801.04189;Divisibility of L-Polynomials for a Family of Curves;We consider the question of when the L-polynomial of one curve divides the L-polynomial of another curve. A theorem of Tate gives an answer in terms of jacobians. We consider the question in terms of the curves. The last author gave an invited talk at the 12th International Conference on Finite Fields and Their Applications on this topic, and stated two conjectures. In this article we prove one of those conjectures.;math.AG
1801.04190;Youla Coding and Computation of Gaussian Feedback Capacity;In this paper, we propose an approach to numerically compute the feedback capacity of stationary finite dimensional Gaussian channels and construct (arbitrarily close to) capacity-achieving feedback codes. In particular, we first extend the interpretation of feedback communication over stationary finite dimensional Gaussian channels as feedback control systems by showing that, the problem of finding stabilizing feedback controllers with maximal reliable transmission rate over Youla parameters coincides with the problem of finding strictly causal filters to achieve feedback capacity derived in [2]. This extended interpretation provides an approach to construct deterministic feedback coding schemes with double exponential decaying error probability. We next propose asymptotic capacity-achieving upper bounds, which can be numerically evaluated by solving finite dimensional convex optimizations. From the filters that achieve the upper bounds, we apply the Youla-based interpretation to construct feasible filters, i.e., feedback codes, leading to a sequence of lower bounds. We prove the sequence of lower bounds is asymptotically capacity-achieving.;cs.IT
1801.04191;Computing permanents of complex diagonally dominant matrices and tensors;We prove that for any $\lambda &gt, 1$, fixed in advance, the permanent of an $n \times n$ complex matrix, where the absolute value of each diagonal entry is at least $\lambda$ times bigger than the sum of the absolute values of all other entries in the same row, can be approximated within any relative error $0 &lt, \epsilon &lt, 1$ in quasi-polynomial $n^{O(\ln n - \ln \epsilon)}$ time. We extend this result to multidimensional permanents of tensors and discuss its application to weighted counting of perfect matchings in hypergraphs.;math.CO
1801.04195;Periodic points of a Landen transformation;We prove the existence of 3-periodic orbits in a dynamical system associated to a Landen transformation previously studied by Boros, Chamberland and Moll, disproving a conjecture on the dynamics of this planar map introduced by the latter author. To this end we present a systematic methodology to determine and locate analytically isolated periodic points of algebraic maps. This approach can be useful to study other discrete dynamical systems with algebraic nature. Complementary results on the dynamics of the map associated with the Landen transformation are also presented.;math.DS
1801.04198;Non-integrability of the minimum-time Kepler problem;We prove that the minimum-time controlled Kepler problem is not Liouville integrable in the class of meromorphic functions, via the Moral\`es-Ramis theory.;math.DS
1801.04205;Determining Projection Constants of Univariate Polynomial Spaces;The long-standing problem of minimal projections is addressed from a computational point of view. Techniques to determine bounds on the projection constants of univariate polynomial spaces are presented. The upper bound, produced by a linear program, and the lower bound, produced by a semidefinite program exploiting the method of moments, are often close enough to deduce the projection constant with reasonable accuracy. The implementation of these programs makes it possible to find the projection constant of several three-dimensional spaces with five digits of accuracy, as well as the projection constants of the spaces of cubic, quartic, and quintic polynomials with four digits of accuracy. Beliefs about uniqueness and shape-preservation of minimal projections are contested along the way.;math.NA
1801.04209;Slant H-Toeplitz Operators on the Hardy space;The notion of slant H-Toeplitz operator $V_\phi$ on the Hardy space $H^2$ is introduced and its characterizations are obtained. We have shown that an operator on the space $H^2$ is slant H-Toeplitz if and only if its matrix is a slant H-Toeplitz matrix. In addition the conditions under which slant Toeplitz and slant Hankel operators become slant H-Toeplitz operators are also obtained.;math.FA
1801.04210;Asymptotic Dirichlet problems in warped products;We study the asymptotic Dirichlet problem for Killing graphs with prescribed mean curvature $H$ in warped product manifolds $M\times_\varrho \mathbb{R}$. In the first part of the paper, we prove the existence of Killing graphs with prescribed boundary on geodesic balls under suitable assumptions on $H$ and the mean curvature of the Killing cylinders over geodesic spheres. In the process we obtain a uniform interior gradient estimate improving previous results by Dajczer and de Lira. In the second part we solve the asymptotic Dirichlet problem in a large class of manifolds whose sectional curvatures are allowed to go to $0$ or to $-\infty$ provided that $H$satisfies certain bounds with respect to the sectional curvatures of $M$ and the norm of the Killing vector field. Finally we obtain non-existence results if the prescribed mean curvature function $H$ grows too fast.;math.DG
1801.04214;Heuristics in direction of a p-adic Brauer--Siegel theorem;Let p be a fixed prime number. Let K be a totally real number field of discriminant D\_K and let T\_K be the torsion group of the Galois group of the maximal abelian p-ramified pro-p-extension of K (under Leopoldt's conjecture). We conjecture the existence of a constant C\_p&gt,0 such that log(\#T\_K) $\le$ C\_p log(\sqrt(D\_K)) when K varies in some specified families (e.g., fields of fixed degree). In some sense, we suggest the existence of a p-adic analogue, of the classical Brauer--Siegel Theorem, wearing here on the valuation of the residue at s=1 (essentially equal to \#T\_K) of the p-adic zeta-function zeta\_p(s) of K.We shall use a different definition that of Washington, given in the 1980's, and approach this question via the arithmetical study of T\_K since p-adic analysis seems to fail because of possible abundant "Siegel zeros" of zeta\_p(s), contrary to the classical framework.We give extensive numerical verifications for quadratic and cubic fields (cyclic or not) and publish the PARI/GP programs directly usable by the reader for numerical improvements. Such a conjecture (if exact) reinforces our conjecture that any fixed number field K is p-rational (i.e., T\_K=1) for all p &gt,&gt, 0 .;math.NT
1801.04215;A unifying Perron-Frobenius theorem for nonnegative tensors via multi-homogeneous maps;Inspired by the definition of symmetric decomposition, we introduce the concept of shape partition of a tensor and formulate a general tensor spectral problem that includes all the relevant spectral problems as special cases. We formulate irreducibility and symmetry properties of a nonnegative tensor $T$ in terms of the associated shape partition. We recast the spectral problem for $T$ as a fixed point problem on a suitable product of projective spaces. This allows us to use the theory of multi-homogeneous order-preserving maps to derive a general and unifying Perron-Frobenius theorem for nonnegative tensors that either implies previous results of this kind or improves them by weakening the assumptions there considered. We introduce a general power method for the computation of the dominant tensor eigenpair, and provide a detailed convergence analysis.;math.SP
1801.04216;Poincar&#xe9, inequality on complete Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded below;We prove that complete Riemannian manifolds with polynomial growth and Ricci curvature bounded from below, admit uniform Poincar\'e inequalities. A global, uniform Poincar\'e inequality for horospheres in the universal cover of a closed, $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with pinched negative sectional curvature follows as a corollary.;math.DG
1801.04223;Machine Intelligence Techniques for Next-Generation Context-Aware Wireless Networks;The next generation wireless networks (i.e. 5G and beyond), which would be extremely dynamic and complex due to the ultra-dense deployment of heterogeneous networks (HetNets), poses many critical challenges for network planning, operation, management and troubleshooting. At the same time, generation and consumption of wireless data are becoming increasingly distributed with ongoing paradigm shift from people-centric to machine-oriented communications, making the operation of future wireless networks even more complex. In mitigating the complexity of future network operation, new approaches of intelligently utilizing distributed computational resources with improved context-awareness becomes extremely important. In this regard, the emerging fog (edge) computing architecture aiming to distribute computing, storage, control, communication, and networking functions closer to end users, have a great potential for enabling efficient operation of future wireless networks. These promising architectures make the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) principles which incorporate learning, reasoning and decision-making mechanism, as natural choices for designing a tightly integrated network. Towards this end, this article provides a comprehensive survey on the utilization of AI integrating machine learning, data analytics and natural language processing (NLP) techniques for enhancing the efficiency of wireless network operation. In particular, we provide comprehensive discussion on the utilization of these techniques for efficient data acquisition, knowledge discovery, network planning, operation and management of the next generation wireless networks. A brief case study utilizing the AI techniques for this network has also been provided.;cs.IT
1801.04224;Reducibility of first order linear operators on tori via Moser&#x27,s theorem;In this paper we prove reducibility of classes of linear first order operators on tori by applying a generalization of Moser's theorem on straightening of vector fields on a torus. We consider vector fields which are a $C^\infty$ perturbations of a constant vector field, and prove that they are conjugated --by a $C^\infty$ torus diffeomorphism-- to a constant diophantine flow, provided that the perturbation is small in some given $H^{s_1}$ norm and that the initial frequency is in some Cantor-like set. Actually in the classical results of this type the regularity of the change of coordinates which straightens the perturbed vector field coincides with the class of regularity in which the perturbation is required to be small. This improvement is achieved thanks to ideas and techniques coming from the Nash-Moser theory.;math.AP
1801.04229;List Decoding of Locally Repairable Codes;We show that locally repairable codes (LRCs) can be list decoded efficiently beyond the Johnson radius for a large range of parameters by utilizing the local error correction capabilities. The new decoding radius is derived and the asymptotic behavior is analyzed. We give a general list decoding algorithm for LRCs that achieves this radius along with an explicit realization for a class of LRCs based on Reed-Solomon codes (Tamo-Barg LRCs). Further, a probabilistic algorithm for unique decoding of low complexity is given and its success probability analyzed.;cs.IT
1801.04230;Asymptotics for the resolvent equation associated to the game-theoretic $p$-laplacian;We consider the (viscosity) solution $u^\varepsilon$ of the elliptic equation $\varepsilon^2\Delta_p^G u= u$ in a domain (not necessarily bounded), satisfying $u=1$ on its boundary. Here, $\Delta_p^G$ is the {\it game-theoretic or normalized $p$-laplacian}. We derive asymptotic formulas for $\varepsilon\to 0^+$ involving the values of $u^\varepsilon$, in the spirit of Varadhan's work \cite{Va}, and its $q$-mean on balls touching the boundary, thus generalizing that obtained in \cite{MS-AM} for $p=q=2$. As in a related parabolic problem, investigated in \cite{BM}, we link the relevant asymptotic behavior to the geometry of the domain.;math.AP
1801.04233;Artin group injection in the Hecke algebra for right-angled groups;For any Coxeter system we consider the algebra generated by the projections over the parabolic quotients. In the finite case it turn out that this algebra is isomorphic to the monoid algebra of the Coxeter monoid (0-Hecke algebra). In the infinite case it contains the Coxeter monoid algebra as a proper subalgebra. This construction provides a faithful integral representation of the Coxeter monoid algebra of any Coxeter system. As an application we will prove that a right-angled Artin group injects in Hecke algebra of the corresponding right-angled Coxeter group.;math.RT
1801.04236;A Manin-Mumford theorem for the maximal compact subgroup of a universal vectorial extension of a product of elliptic curves;We study the intersection of an algebraic variety with the maximal compact subgroup of a universal vectorial extension of a product of elliptic curves. For this intersection we show a Manin-Mumford type statement. This answers some questions posed by Corvaja-Masser-Zannier which arose in connection with their investigation of the intersection of a curve with real analytic subgroups of various algebraic groups. They prove finiteness in the situation of a single elliptic curve. Using Khovanskii's zero-estimates combined with a stratification result of Gabrielov-Vorobjov and recent work of the authors we obtain effective bounds for this intersection that only depend on the degree of the algebraic variety, and the dimension of the group. This seems new even if restricted to the classical Manin-Mumford statement.;math.NT
1801.04237;Inverse problem of potential theory;P. Novikov in 1938 has proved that if $u_1(x)=u_2(x)$ for $|x|&gt,R$, where $R&gt,0$ is a large number, $$u_j(x):=\int_{D_j}g_0(x,y)dy, \quad g_0(x,y):=\frac 1 {4\pi |x-y|},$$ and $D_j\subset \mathbb{R}^3$, $j=1,2,$ $D_j\subset B_R$, are bounded, connected, smooth domains, star-shaped with respect to a common point, then $D_1=D_2$. Here $B_R:= \{x: |x|\le R\}$. <br />Our basic results are: <br />a) the removal of the assumption about star-shapeness of $D_j$, <br />b) a new approach to the problem, <br />c) the construction of counter-examples for a similar problem in which $g_0$ is replaced by $g=\frac {e^{ik|x-y|}}{4\pi |x-y|}$, where $k&gt,0$ is a fixed constant.;math.AP
1801.04239;Commutative modified Rota-Baxter algebras, shuffle products and Hopf algebras;In this paper, we begin a systematic study of modified Rota-Baxter algebras, as an associative analogue of the modified classical Yang-Baxter equation. We construct free commutative modified Rota-Baxter algebras by a variation of the shuffle product and describe the structure both recursively and explicitly. We then provide these algebras with a Hopf algebra structure by applying a Hochschild cocycle.;math.RA
1801.04241;Optimal Streaming Codes for Channels with Burst and Arbitrary Erasures;This paper considers transmitting a sequence of messages (a streaming source) over a packet erasure channel. In each time slot, the source constructs a packet based on the current and the previous messages and transmits the packet, which may be erased when the packet travels from the source to the destination. Every source message must be recovered perfectly at the destination subject to a fixed decoding delay. We assume that the channel loss model introduces either one burst erasure or multiple arbitrary erasures in any fixed-sized sliding window. Under this channel loss assumption, we fully characterize the maximum achievable rate by constructing streaming codes that achieve the optimal rate. In addition, our construction of optimal streaming codes implies the full characterization of the maximum achievable rate for convolutional codes with any given column distance, column span and decoding delay. Numerical results demonstrate that the optimal streaming codes outperform existing streaming codes of comparable complexity over some instances of the Gilbert-Elliott channel and the Fritchman channel.;cs.IT
1801.04243;Inexact cuts in Deterministic and Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming applied to linear optimization problems;We introduce an extension of Dual Dynamic Programming (DDP) to solve linear dynamic programming equations. We call this extension IDDP-LP which applies to situations where some or all primal and dual subproblems to be solved along the iterations of the method are solved with a bounded error (inexactly). We provide convergence theorems both in the case when errors are bounded and for asymptotically vanishing errors. We extend the analysis to stochastic linear dynamic programming equations, introducing Inexact Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming for linear programs (ISDDP-LP), an inexact variant of SDDP applied to linear programs corresponding to the situation where some or all problems to be solved in the forward and backward passes of SDDP are solved approximately. We also provide convergence theorems for ISDDP-LP for bounded and asymptotically vanishing errors. Finally, we present the results of numerical experiments comparing SDDP and ISSDP-LP on a portfolio problem with direct transation costs modelled as a multistage stochastic linear optimization problem. On these experiments, ISDDP-LP allows us to obtain a good policy faster than SDDP.;math.OC
1801.04244;Porous medium equation with nonlocal pressure;We provide a rather complete description of the results obtained so far on the nonlinear diffusion equation $u_t=\nabla\cdot (u^{m-1}\nabla (-\Delta)^{-s}u)$, which describes a flow through a porous medium driven by a nonlocal pressure. We consider constant parameters $m&gt,1$ and $0&lt,s&lt,1$, we assume that the solutions are non-negative, and the problem is posed in the whole space. We present a theory of existence of solutions, results on uniqueness, and relation to other models. As new results of this paper, we prove the existence of self-similar solutions in the range when $N=1$ and $m&gt,2$, and the asymptotic behavior of solutions when $N=1$. The cases $m = 1$ and $m = 2$ were rather well known.;math.AP
1801.04250;Graph cover-saturation;Graph $G$ is $F$-saturated if $G$ contains no copy of graph $F$ but any edge added to $G$ produces at least one copy of $F$. One common variant of saturation is to remove the former restriction: $G$ is $F$-semi-saturated if any edge added to $G$ produces at least one new copy of $F$. In this paper we take this idea one step further. Rather than just allowing edges of $G$ to be in a copy of $F$, we require it: $G$ is $F$-covered if every edge of $G$ is in a copy of $F$. It turns out that there is smooth interaction between coverage and semi-saturation, which opens for investigation a natural analogue to saturation numbers. Therefore we present preliminary cover-saturation theory and structural bounds for the cover-saturation numbers of graphs. We also establish asymptotic cover-saturation densities for cliques and paths, and upper and lower bounds (with small gaps) for cycles and stars.;math.CO
1801.04254;Optimal data-driven estimation of generalized Markov state models for non-equilibrium dynamics;There are multiple ways in which a stochastic system can be out of statistical equilibrium. It might be subject to time-varying forcing, or be in a transient phase on its way towards equilibrium, it might even be in equilibrium without us noticing it, due to insufficient observations, and it even might be a system failing to admit an equilibrium distribution at all. We review some of the approaches that model the effective statistical behavior of equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamical systems, and show that both cases can be considered under the unified framework of optimal low-rank approximation of so-called transfer operators. Particular attention is given to the connection between these methods, Markov state models, and the concept of metastability, further to the estimation of such reduced order models from finite simulation data. We illustrate our considerations by numerical examples.;math.DS
1801.04257;On projective and affine equivalence of sub-Riemannian metrics;Consider a smooth manifold $M$ equipped with a bracket generating distribution $D$. Two sub-Riemannian metrics on $(M,D)$ are said to be projectively (resp. affinely) equivalent if they have the same geodesics up to reparameterization (resp. up to affine reparameterization). A sub-Riemannian metric $g$ is called rigid (resp. conformally rigid) with respect to projective/affine equivalence, if any sub-Riemannian metric which is projectively/affinely equivalent to $g$ is constantly proportional to $g$ (resp. conformal to $g$). In the Riemannian case the local classification of projectively and affinely equivalent metrics is classical (Levi-Civita, Eisenhart). In particular, a Riemannian metric which is not rigid satisfies the following two special properties: its geodesic flow possesses nontrivial integrals and the metric induces certain canonical product structure on the ambient manifold. These classification results were extended to contact and quasi-contact distributions by Zelenko. Our general goal is to extend these results to arbitrary sub-Riemannian manifolds, and we establish two types of results toward this goal: if a sub-Riemannian metric is not projectively conformally rigid, then, first, its flow of normal extremals has at least one nontrivial integral quadratic on the fibers of the cotangent bundle and, second, the nilpotent approximation of the underlying distribution at any point admits a product structure. As a consequence we obtain two types of genericity results: first, we show that a generic sub-Riemannian metric on a fixed pair $(M,D)$ is projectively conformally rigid. Second, we prove that, except for special pairs $(m,n)$, every sub-Riemannian metric on a rank $m$ generic distribution in an $n$-dimensional manifold is projectively conformally rigid. For the affine equivalence in both genericity results conformal rigidity can be replaced by usual rigidity.;math.DG
1801.04259;The smallest Laplace eigenvalue of homogeneous 3-spheres;We establish an explicit expression for the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of the Laplace--Beltrami operator on every homogeneous metric on the 3-sphere, or equivalently, on SU(2) endowed with left-invariant metric. For the subfamily of 3-dimensional Berger spheres, we obtain a full description of their spectra. We also give several consequences of the mentioned expression. One of them improves known estimates for the smallest non-zero eigenvalue in terms of the diameter for homogeneous 3-spheres. Another application shows that the spectrum of the Laplace--Beltrami operator distinguishes up to isometry any left-invariant metric on SU(2). It is also proved the non-existence of constant scalar curvature metrics conformal and arbitrarily close to any non-round homogeneous metric on the 3-sphere. All of the above results are extended to left-invariant metrics on SO(3), that is, homogeneous metrics on the 3-dimensional real projective space.;math.DG
1801.04262;A note on Herglotz&#x27,s theorem for time series on function spaces;In this article, we prove Herglotz's theorem for Hilbert-valued time series. This requires the notion of an operator-valued measure, which we shall make precise for our setting. Herglotz's theorem for functional time series allows to generalize existing results that are central to frequency domain analysis on the function space. In particular, we use this result to prove the existence of a functional Cram{\'e}r representation of a large class of processes, including those with jumps in the spectral distribution and long-memory processes. We furthermore obtain an optimal finite dimensional reduction of the time series under weaker assumptions than available in the literature. The results of this paper therefore enable Fourier analysis for processes of which the spectral density operator does not necessarily exist.;math.ST
1801.04272;On the projective height zero conjecture;Recently, Malle and Navarro put forward a projective version of Brauer's celebrated height zero conjecture on blocks of finite groups. In this short note we show that Brauer's original conjecture implies the projective version.;math.RT
1801.04273;Integral cohomology of configuration spaces of the sphere;We compute the cohomology of the unordered configuration spaces of the sphere $S^2$ with integral and with $\mathbb{Z}/p \mathbb{Z}$-coefficients using a cell complex by Fuks, Vainshtein and Napolitano.;math.AT
1801.04285;Analysis of hyper-singular, fractional, and order-zero singular integral operators;In this article, we conduct a study of integral operators defined in terms of non-convolution type kernels with singularities of various degrees. The operators that fall within our scope of research include fractional integrals, fractional derivatives, pseudodifferential operators, Calder\'on-Zygmund operators, and many others. The main results of this article are built around the notion of an operator calculus that connects operators with different kernel singularities via vanishing moment conditions and composition with fractional derivative operators. We also provide several boundedness results on weighted and unweighted distribution spaces, including homogeneous Sobolev, Besov, and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces, that are necessary and sufficient for the operator's vanishing moment properties, as well as certain behaviors for the operator under composition with fractional derivative and integral operators. As applications, we prove $T1$ type theorems for singular integral operators with different singularities, boundedness results for pseudodifferential operators belonging to the forbidden class $S_{1,1}^0$, fractional order and hyper-singular paraproduct boundedness, a smooth-oscillating decomposition for singular integrals, sparse domination estimates that quantify regularity and oscillation, and several operator calculus results. It is of particular interest that many of these results do not require $L^2$-boundedness of the operator, and furthermore, we apply our results to some operators that are known not to be $L^2$-bounded.;math.FA
1801.04296;Acyclic anyon models, thermal anyon error corrections, and braiding universality;Acyclic anyon models are non-abelian anyon models for which thermal anyon errors can be corrected. In this note, we characterize acyclic anyon models and raise the question if the restriction to acyclic anyon models is a deficiency of the current protocol or could it be intrinsically related to the computational power of non-abelian anyons. We also obtain general results on acyclic anyon models and find new acyclic anyon models such as $SO(8)_2$ and untwisted Dijkgraaf-Witten theories of nilpotent finite groups.;math.QA
1801.04299;Belief Propagation Decoding of Polar Codes on Permuted Factor Graphs;We show that the performance of iterative belief propagation (BP) decoding of polar codes can be enhanced by decoding over different carefully chosen factor graph realizations. With a genie-aided stopping condition, it can achieve the successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding performance which has already been shown to achieve the maximum likelihood (ML) bound provided that the list size is sufficiently large. The proposed decoder is based on different realizations of the polar code factor graph with randomly permuted stages during decoding. Additionally, a different way of visualizing the polar code factor graph is presented, facilitating the analysis of the underlying factor graph and the comparison of different graph permutations. In our proposed decoder, a high rate Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) code is concatenated with a polar code and used as an iteration stopping criterion (i.e., genie) to even outperform the SCL decoder of the plain polar code (without the CRC-aid). Although our permuted factor graph-based decoder does not outperform the SCL-CRC decoder, it achieves, to the best of our knowledge, the best performance of all iterative polar decoders presented thus far.;cs.IT
1801.04301;A Family of Tractable Graph Distances;Important data mining problems such as nearest-neighbor search and clustering admit theoretical guarantees when restricted to objects embedded in a metric space. Graphs are ubiquitous, and clustering and classification over graphs arise in diverse areas, including, e.g., image processing and social networks. Unfortunately, popular distance scores used in these applications, that scale over large graphs, are not metrics and thus come with no guarantees. Classic graph distances such as, e.g., the chemical and the CKS distance are arguably natural and intuitive, and are indeed also metrics, but they are intractable: as such, their computation does not scale to large graphs. We define a broad family of graph distances, that includes both the chemical and the CKS distance, and prove that these are all metrics. Crucially, we show that our family includes metrics that are tractable. Moreover, we extend these distances by incorporating auxiliary node attributes, which is important in practice, while maintaining both the metric property and tractability.;math.CO
1801.04310;Flow Decomposition for Multi-User Channels - Part I;A framework based on the idea of flow decomposition is proposed to characterize the decode-forward region for general multi-source, multi-relay, all-cast channels with independent input distributions. The region is difficult to characterize directly when deadlocks occur between two relay nodes, in which both relays benefit by decoding after each other. Rate-vectors in the decode-forward region depend ambiguously on the outcomes of all deadlocks in the channel. The region is characterized indirectly in two phases. The first phase assumes relays can operate non-causally. It is shown that every rate-vector in the decode-forward region corresponds to a set of flow decompositions, which describe the messages decoded at each node with respect to the messages forwarded by all the other nodes. The second phase imposes causal restrictions on the relays. Given an arbitrary set of (possibly non-causal) flow decompositions, necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of an equivalent set of causal flow decompositions that achieves the same rate-vector region.;cs.IT
1801.04312;A characterisation of $&#x3c4,$-tilting finite algebras;We prove that a finite dimensional algebra is $\tau$-tilting finite if and only if it does not admit large silting modules. Moreover, we show that for a $\tau$-tilting finite algebra $A$ there is a bijection between isomorphism classes of basic support $\tau$-tilting (that is, finite dimensional silting) modules and equivalence classes of ring epimorphisms $A\longrightarrow B$ with ${\rm Tor}_1^A(B,B)=0$. It follows that a finite dimensional algebra is $\tau$-tilting finite if and only if there are only finitely many equivalence classes of such ring epimorphisms.;math.RT
1801.04313;On the convergence of iterative solvers for polygonal discontinuous Galerkin discretizations;We study the convergence of iterative linear solvers for discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of systems of hyperbolic conservation laws with polygonal mesh elements compared with that of traditional triangular elements. We solve the semi-discrete system of equations by means of an implicit time discretization method, using iterative solvers such as the block Jacobi method and GMRES. We perform a von Neumann analysis to analytically study the convergence of the block Jacobi method for the two-dimensional advection equation on four classes of regular meshes: hexagonal, square, equilateral-triangular, and right-triangular. We find that hexagonal and square meshes give rise to smaller eigenvalues, and thus result in faster convergence of Jacobi's method. We perform numerical experiments with variable velocity fields, irregular, unstructured meshes, and the Euler equations of gas dynamics to confirm and extend these results. We additionally study the effect of polygonal meshes on the performance of block ILU(0) and Jacobi preconditioners for the GMRES method.;math.NA
1801.04322;Corner cases, singularities, and dynamic factoring;In Eikonal equations, rarefaction is a common phenomenon known to degrade the rate of convergence of numerical methods. The `factoring' approach alleviates this difficulty by deriving a PDE for a new (locally smooth) variable while capturing the rarefaction-related singularity in a known (non-smooth) `factor'. Previously this technique was successfully used to address rarefaction fans arising at point sources. In this paper we show how similar ideas can be used to factor the 2D rarefactions arising due to nonsmoothness of domain boundaries or discontinuities in PDE coefficients. Locations and orientations of such rarefaction fans are not known in advance and we construct a `just-in-time factoring' method that identifies them dynamically. The resulting algorithm is a generalization of the Fast Marching Method originally introduced for the regular (unfactored) Eikonal equations. We show that our approach restores the first-order convergence and illustrate it using a range of maze navigation examples with non-permeable and `slowly permeable' obstacles.;math.NA
1801.04325;Hopf bifurcation and period functions for Wright type delay differential equations;We present the simplest criterion that determines the direction of the Hopf bifurcations of the delay differential equation $x'(t)=-\mu f(x(t-1))$, as the parameter $\mu$ passes through the critical values $\mu_k$. We give a complete classification of the possible bifurcation sequences. Using this information and the Cooke-transformation, we obtain local estimates and monotonicity properties of the periods of the bifurcating limit cycles along the Hopf-branches. Further, we show how our results relate to the often required property that the nonlinearity has negative Schwarzian derivative.;math.DS
1801.04327;La th&#xe9,orie arithm&#xe9,tique des grandeurs alg&#xe9,briques de Kronecker (1882);This article attempts at a linear historical and mathematical commentary of Kronecker's programmatic memoir "Grundz\"uge einer arithmetischen Theorie der algebraischen Gr\"ossen" (1882).;math.HO
1801.04339;Estimating the Number of Connected Components in a Graph via Subgraph Sampling;Learning properties of large graphs from samples has been an important problem in statistical network analysis since the early work of Goodman \cite{Goodman1949} and Frank \cite{Frank1978}. We revisit a problem formulated by Frank \cite{Frank1978} of estimating the number of connected components in a large graph based on the subgraph sampling model, in which we randomly sample a subset of the vertices and observe the induced subgraph. The key question is whether accurate estimation is achievable in the \emph{sublinear} regime where only a vanishing fraction of the vertices are sampled. We show that it is impossible if the parent graph is allowed to contain high-degree vertices or long induced cycles. For the class of chordal graphs, where induced cycles of length four or above are forbidden, we characterize the optimal sample complexity within constant factors and construct linear-time estimators that provably achieve these bounds. This significantly expands the scope of previous results which have focused on unbiased estimators and special classes of graphs such as forests or cliques. <br />Both the construction and the analysis of the proposed methodology rely on combinatorial properties of chordal graphs and identities of induced subgraph counts. They, in turn, also play a key role in proving minimax lower bounds based on construction of random instances of graphs with matching structures of small subgraphs.;math.ST
1801.04352;On the Capacity Region of the Deterministic Y-Channel with Common and Private Messages;In multi user Gaussian relay networks, it is desirable to transmit private information to each user as well as common information to all of them. However, the capacity region of such networks with both kinds of information is not easy to characterize. The prior art used simple linear deterministic models in order to approximate the capacities of these Gaussian networks. This paper discusses the capacity region of the deterministic Y-channel with private and common messages. In this channel, each user aims at delivering two private messages to the other two users in addition to a common message directed towards both of them. As there is no direct link between the users, all messages must pass through an intermediate relay. We present outer-bounds on the rate region using genie aided and cut-set bounds. Then, we develop a greedy scheme to define an achievable region and show that at a certain number of levels at the relay, our achievable region coincides with the upper bound. Finally, we argue that these bounds for this setup are not sufficient to characterize the capacity region.;cs.IT
1801.04359;Queue-aware Energy Efficient Control for Dense Wireless Networks;We consider the problem of long term power allocation in dense wireless networks. The framework considered in this paper is of interest for machine-type communications (MTC). In order to guarantee an optimal operation of the system while being as power efficient as possible, the allocation policy must take into account both the channel and queue states of the devices. This is a complex stochastic optimization problem, that can be cast as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) over a huge state space. In order to tackle this state space explosion, we perform a mean-field approximation on the MDP. Letting the number of devices grow to infinity the MDP converges to a deterministic control problem. By solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation, we obtain a well-performing power allocation policy for the original stochastic problem, which turns out to be a threshold-based policy and can then be easily implemented in practice.;cs.IT
1801.04360;Rational Solutions of the Painlev&#xe9,-III Equation;All of the six Painlev\'e equations except the first have families of rational solutions, which are frequently important in applications. The third Painlev\'e equation in generic form depends on two parameters $m$ and $n$, and it has rational solutions if and only if at least one of the parameters is an integer. We use known algebraic representations of the solutions to study numerically how the distributions of poles and zeros behave as $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ increases and how the patterns vary with $m\in\mathbb{C}$. This study suggests that it is reasonable to consider the rational solutions in the limit of large $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ with $m\in\mathbb{C}$ being an auxiliary parameter. To analyze the rational solutions in this limit, algebraic techniques need to be supplemented by analytical ones, and the main new contribution of this paper is to develop a Riemann-Hilbert representation of the rational solutions of Painlev\'e-III that is amenable to asymptotic analysis. Assuming further that $m$ is a half-integer, we derive from the Riemann-Hilbert representation a finite dimensional Hankel system for the rational solution in which $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ appears as an explicit parameter.;math.CA
1801.04361;Two problems in Partial Differential Equations (in Portuguese);In this work, we examine two important problems in the theory of nonlinear PDEs. In Part I, we propose and solve a more general and complete version of the celebrated Leray's problem for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $ \mathbb{R}^{3} \!$, which in its simplest form was suggested by J.$\,$Leray in 1934 (and solved only in the 1980s by T.$\,$ Kato, K.$\,$Masuda and other authors). A number of related new results of clear interest to the theory of Leray's solutions are also given here. <br />In Part II, which is independent of Part I and can be read separately, we introduce an important new collection of problems concerning global existence results and blow-up phenomena for solutions of conservative advection-diffusion equations in $ \mathbb{R}^{n} $ where heterogeneities in the lower order terms tend to destabilize the solution (everywhere or in certain regions), strongly competing with the viscous dissipation effects to determine the overall solution behavior. Here, we consider the case of superlinear advection (and arbitrary dimension), which may cause finite-time blow-up in several important spaces. We then point out a new kind of phenomena --- one that may be properly named "anti-Fujita" for its vivid contrast to the type of blow-up behavior discovered by Fujita in the 1960s, and which has been investigated ever since --- that has apparently been completely overlooked in the literature.;math.AP
1801.04363;Design of accurate formulas for approximating functions in weighted Hardy spaces by discrete energy minimization;We propose a simple and effective method for designing approximation formulas for weighted analytic functions. We consider spaces of such functions according to weight functions expressing the decay properties of the functions. Then, we adopt the minimum worst error of the $n$-point approximation formulas in each space for characterizing the optimal sampling points for the approximation. In order to obtain approximately optimal sampling points, we consider minimization of a discrete energy related to the minimum worst error. Consequently, we obtain an approximation formula and its theoretical error estimate in each space. In addition, from some numerical experiments, we observe that the formula generated by the proposed method outperforms the corresponding formula derived with sinc approximation, which is near optimal in each space.;math.NA
1801.04366;Estimation in the group action channel;We analyze the problem of estimating a signal from multiple measurements on a $\mbox{group action channel}$ that linearly transforms a signal by a random group action followed by a fixed projection and additive Gaussian noise. This channel is motivated by applications such as multi-reference alignment and cryo-electron microscopy. We focus on the large noise regime prevalent in these applications. We give a lower bound on the mean square error (MSE) of any asymptotically unbiased estimator of the signal's orbit in terms of the signal's moment tensors, which implies that the MSE is bounded away from 0 when $N/\sigma^{2d}$ is bounded from above, where $N$ is the number of observations, $\sigma$ is the noise standard deviation, and $d$ is the so-called $\mbox{moment order cutoff}$. In contrast, the maximum likelihood estimator is shown to be consistent if $N /\sigma^{2d}$ diverges.;cs.IT
1801.04369;Is profile likelihood a true likelihood? An argument in favor;Profile likelihood is the key tool for dealing with nuisance parameters in likelihood theory. It is often asserted, however, that profile likelihood is not a 'true' likelihood. One implication is that likelihood theory lacks the generality of e.g. Bayesian inference, wherein marginalization is the universal tool for dealing with nuisance parameters. Here we argue that profile likelihood has as much claim to being a true likelihood as a marginal probability has to being a true probability distribution. The crucial point we argue is that a likelihood function is naturally interpreted as a maxitive possibility measure: given this, the associated theory of integration with respect to maxitive measures delivers profile likelihood as the direct analogue of marginal probability in additive measure theory. Thus, given a background likelihood function, we argue that profiling over the likelihood function is as natural (or as unnatural, as the case may be) as marginalizing over a background probability measure. The connections to Bayesian inference can also be further clarified with the introduction of a suitable logarithmic distance function, in which case the present theory can be naturally described as 'Tropical Bayes' in the sense of tropical algebra.;math.ST
1801.04383;Cohomology rings of compactifications of toric arrangements;Some projective wonderful models for the complement of a toric arrangement in a n-dimensional algebraic torus T were constructed in [3]. In this paper we describe their integer cohomology rings by generators and relations.;math.AT
1801.04384;Distributed Multi-User Secret Sharing;We consider a distributed secret sharing system that consists of a dealer, $n$ storage nodes, and $m$ users. Each user is given access to a certain subset of storage nodes, where it can download the stored data. The dealer wants to securely convey a specific secret $s_j$ to user $j$ via storage nodes, for $j=1,2,\dots,m$, in such a way that no user gets any information about other users' secrets in an information-theoretic sense. To this end, the dealer encodes secrets into several secret shares and loads them into the storage nodes. Given a certain number of storage nodes we find the maximum number of users that can be served in such systems and construct schemes that achieve this. We further define two major properties for such distributed secret sharing systems, \emph{communication complexity} is defined as the total amount of data that users need to download in order to reconstruct their secrets, and \emph{storage overhead} is defined as the total size of data loaded by the dealer into the storage nodes normalized by the total size of secrets. Lower bounds on minimum communication complexity and storage overhead are characterized given any $n$ and $m$. Furthermore, we construct distributed secret sharing protocols, under certain conditions on the system parameters, that simultaneously attain these lower bounds, thereby providing schemes that are optimal in terms of both the communication complexity and the storage overhead. It is shown how to modify the proposed protocols in order to construct schemes with \emph{balanced} storage load and communication complexity.;cs.IT
1801.04392;Certain quaternary quadratic forms of level 48 and their representation numbers;In this paper, we find a basis for the space of modular forms of weight $2$ on $\Gamma_1(48)$. We use this basis to find formulas for the number of representations of a positive integer $n$ by certain quaternary quadratic forms of the form $\sum_{i=1}^4 a_i x_i^2$, $\sum_{i=1}^2 b_i(x_{2i-1}^2 + x_{2i-1}x_{2i}+x_{2i}^2)$ and $a_1x_1^2 + a_2 x_2^2 + b_1(x_3^2+x_3x_4+x_4^2)$, where $a_i$'s belong to $\{1,2,3,4,6,12\}$ and $b_i$'s belong to $\{1,2,4,8,16\}$.;math.NT
1801.04397;A Context-free Grammar for Peaks and Double Descents of Permutations;This paper is concerned with the joint distribution of the number of exterior peaks and the number of proper double descents over permutations on $[n] =\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. The notion of exterior peaks of a permutation was introduced by Aguiar, Bergeron and Nyman in their study of the peak algebra. Gessel obtained the generating function of the number of permutations on $[n]$ with a given number of exterior peaks. On the other hand, by establishing differential equations, Elizalde and Noy derived the generating function for the number of permutations on $[n]$ with a given number of proper double descents. Barry and Basset independently deduced the generating function of the number of permutations on $[n]$ with no proper double descents. We find a context-free grammar which can be used to compute the number of permutations on $[n]$ with a given number of exterior peaks and a given number of proper double descents. Based on the grammar, the recurrence relation of the number of permutations on $[n]$ with a given number of exterior peaks can be easily obtained. Moreover, we use the grammatical calculus to derive the generating function without solving differential equations. Our formula reduces to the formulas of Gessel, Elizalde-Noy, Barry, and Basset. Finally, from the grammar we establish a relationship between our generating function and the generating function of the joint distribution of the number of peaks and the number of double descent derived by Carlitz and Scoville.;math.CO
1801.04398;Ricci solitons in almost $f$-cosymplectic manifolds;In this article we study an almost $f$-cosymplectic manifold admitting a Ricci soliton. We first prove that there do not exist Ricci solitons on an almost cosymplectic $(\kappa,\mu)$-manifold. Further, we consider an almost $f$-cosymplectic manifold admitting a Ricci soliton whose potential vector field is the Reeb vector field and show that a three dimesional almost $f$-cosymplectic is a cosymplectic manifold. Finally we classify a three dimensional $\eta$-Einstein almost $f$-cosymplectic manifold admitting a Ricci soliton.;math.DG
1801.04402;A comparison of two mathematical models of the cerebrospinal fluid dynamics;In this paper we provide the numerical simulations of two cerebrospinal fluid dynamics models by comparing our results with the real data available in literature. The models describe different processes in the cerebrospinal fluid dynamics: the cerebrospinal flow in the ventricles of the brain and the reabsorption of the fluid. In the appendix we show in detail the mathematical analysis of both models and we identify the set of initial conditions for which the solutions of the systems of equations do not exhibit blow up. We investigate step by step the accuracy of these theoretical outcomes with respect to the real cerebrospinal physiology and dynamics.;math.AP
1801.04404;Convexification of a 3-D coefficient inverse scattering problem;A version of the so-called "convexification" numerical method for a coefficient inverse scattering problem for the 3D Hemholtz equation is developed analytically and tested numerically. Backscattering data are used, which result from a single direction of the propagation of the incident plane wave on an interval of frequencies. The method converges globally. The idea is to construct a weighted Tikhonov-like functional. The key element of this functional is the presence of the so-called Carleman Weight Function (CWF). This is the function which is involved in the Carleman estimate for the Laplace operator. This functional is strictly convex on any appropriate ball in a Hilbert space for an appropriate choice of the parameters of the CWF. Thus, both the absence of local minima and convergence of minimizers to the exact solution are guaranteed. Numerical tests demonstrate a good performance of the resulting algorithm. Unlikeprevious the so-called tail functions globally convergent method, we neither do not impose the smallness assumption of the interval of wavenumbers, nor we do not iterate with respect to the so-called tail functions.;math.NA
1801.04409;On semisimplification of tensor categories;We develop the theory of semisimplifications of tensor categories defined by Barrett and Westbury. In particular, we compute the semisimplification of the category of representations of a finite group in characteristic $p$ in terms of representations of the normnalizer of its Sylow $p$-subgroup. This allows us to compute the semisimplification of the representation category of the symmetric group $S_{n+p}$ in characteristic $p$, where $0\le n\le p-1$, and of the Deligne category $\underline{\rm Rep}^{\rm ab}S_t$, where $t\in \Bbb N$. We also compute the semisimplification of the category of representations of the Kac-De Concini quantum group of the Borel subalgebra of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$. We also study tensor functors between Verlinde categories of semisimple algebraic groups arising from the semisimplification construction, and objects of finite type in categories of modular representations of finite groups (i.e., objects generating a fusion category in the semisimplification). Finally, we determine the semisimplifications of the tilting categories of $GL(n)$, $SL(n)$ and $PGL(n)$ in characteristic $2$. In the appendix, we classify categorifications of the Grothendieck ring of representations of $SO(3)$ and its truncations.;math.RT
1801.04410;Reduction of wide subcategories and recollements;In this paper, we prove that if an abelian category $\mathcal{A}$ admits a recollement relative to abelian categories $\mathcal{A}'$ and $\mathcal{A}''$, there is a bijection between wide subcategories in $\mathcal{A}$ containing $i_{*}(\mathcal{A}')$ and wide subcategories in $\mathcal{A}''$ similar to silting reduction and $\tau$-tilting reduction. Moreover, the wide subcategory $\mathcal{C}$ of $\mathcal{A}$ containing $i_{*}(\mathcal{A}')$ admits a new recollement relative to wide subcategories $\mathcal{A}'$ and $j^{*}(\mathcal{C})$ which induced from the original recollement.;math.RT
1801.04412;Energy bound for Kapustin-Witten solutions on $S^3\times\mathbb{R}^+$;We consider solutions of Kapustin-Witten equation with Nahm pole boundary on $S^3\times \mathbb{R}^+$. These solutions are usually called Nahm pole solutions. In this paper, we will prove that there exists a constant $C&gt,0$ such that $\|F_A\|_{L^2}\leq C$ for any Nahm pole solution $(A,\phi)$.;math.DG
1801.04420;LDPC Codes over Gaussian Multiple Access Wiretap Channel;We study the problem of two-user Gaussian multiple access channel (GMAC) in the presence of an external eavesdropper. In this problem, an eavesdropper receives a signal with a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to the legitimate receiver and all transmitted messages should be kept confidential against the eavesdropper. For this purpose, we propose a secure coding scheme on this channel which utilizes low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes by employing random bit insertion and puncturing techniques. At each encoder, the confidential message with some random bits as a random message are systematically encoded, and then the associated bits to the confidential message are punctured. Next, the encoders send their unpunctured bits over a Gaussian multiple access wiretap channel (GMAC-WT). The puncturing distribution applied to the LDPC code is considered in two cases: random and optimized. We utilize a modified extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart analysis to optimize the puncturing distribution for each encoder. The security gap is used as a measure of secrecy for the sent messages over GMAC-WT which should be made as small as possible. We compare the achieved secure rate pair with an achievable secrecy rate region of GMAC-WT to show the effective performance of the proposed scheme. In this paper, equal and unequal power conditions at the transmitters are investigated. For both cases, we attain a fairly small security gap which is equivalent to achieve the points near the secrecy rate region of GMAC-WT.;cs.IT
1801.04422;Asymptotic Distribution of Multilevel Channel Polarization for a Certain Class of Erasure Channels;This study examines multilevel channel polarization for a certain class of erasure channels that the input alphabet size is an arbitrary composite number. We derive limiting proportions of partially noiseless channels for such a class. The results of this study are proved by an argument of convergent sequences, inspired by Alsan and Telatar's simple proof of polarization, and without martingale convergence theorems for polarization process.;cs.IT
1801.04424;Prikry Forcing and Tree Prikry Forcing of Various Filters;In this paper, we answer a question asked in "A minimal Prikry type forcing for singularizing a measurable cardinal" regarding a Mathias criteria for Tree-Prikry forcing. Also we will investigate Prikry forcing using various filters. For completeness and self inclusion reasons, we will give proofs of many known theorems.;math.LO
1801.04427;Sparse NOMA: A Closed-Form Characterization;Understanding fundamental limits of the various technologies suggested for future 5G and beyond cellular systems is crucial for developing efficient state-of-the-art designs. A leading technology of major interest is non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA). In this paper, we derive an explicit rigorous closed-form analytical expression for the optimum spectral efficiency in the large-system limit of regular sparse NOMA, where only a fixed and finite number of orthogonal resources are allocated to any designated user, and vice versa. The basic Verd\'u-Shamai formula for (dense) randomly-spread code-division multiple-access (RS-CDMA) turns out to coincide with the limit of the derived expression, when the number of orthogonal resources per user grows large. Furthermore, regular sparse NOMA is rigorously shown to be spectrally more efficient than RS-CDMA across the entire system load range. It may therefore serve as an efficient means for reducing the throughput gap to orthogonal transmission in the underloaded regime, and to the ultimate Cover-Wyner bound in overloaded systems. The results analytically reinforce preliminary conclusions in [1], which mostly relied on heuristics and numerical observations. The spectral efficiency is also derived in closed form for the suboptimal linear minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE) receiver, which again extends the corresponding Verd\'u-Shamai LMMSE formula to regular sparse NOMA.;cs.IT
1801.04428;Bi-Lipschitz characteristic of quasiconformal self-mappings of the unit disk satisfying bi-harmonic equation;Suppose that $f$ is a $K$-quasiconformal self-mapping of the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$, which satisfies the following: $(1)$ the biharmonic equation $\Delta(\Delta f)=g$ $(g\in \mathcal{C}(\overline{\mathbb{D}}))$, (2) the boundary condition $\Delta f=\varphi$ ($\varphi\in\mathcal{C}(\mathbb{T})$ and $\mathbb{T}$ denotes the unit circle), and $(3)$ $f(0)=0$. The purpose of this paper is to prove that $f$ is Lipschitz continuos, and, further, it is bi-Lipschitz continuous when $\|g\|_{\infty}$ and $\|\varphi\|_{\infty}$ are small enough. Moreover, the estimates are asymptotically sharp as $K\to 1$, $\|g\|_{\infty}\to 0$ and $\|\varphi\|_{\infty}\to 0$, and thus, such a mapping $f$ behaves almost like a rotation for sufficiently small $K$, $\|g\|_{\infty}$ and $\|\varphi\|_{\infty}$.;math.CV
1801.04431;On behavior of a class of mappings in terms of prime ends;The paper is devoted to the study of mappings with finite distortion, actively studied recently. For mappings whose inverse satisfy the Poletsky inequality, the results on boundary behavior in terms of prime ends are obtained. In particular, it was proved that the families of the indicated mappings are equicontinuous at the points of the boundary if a certain function determining the distortion of the module under the mappings is integrable in a given domain.;math.CV
1801.04436;Aperiodic Sampled-Data Control via Explicit Transmission Mapping: A Set Invariance Approach;Event-triggered and self-triggered control have been proposed in recent years as promising control strategies to reduce communication resources in Networked Control Systems (NCSs). Based on the notion of set-invariance theory, this note presents new self-triggered control strategies for linear discrete-time systems subject to input and state constraints. The proposed schemes not only achieve communication reduction for NCSs, but also ensure both asymptotic stability of the origin and constraint satisfactions. A numerical simulation example validates the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.;math.OC
1801.04439;Variable-Length Resolvability for Mixed Sources and its Application to Variable-Length Source Coding;In the problem of variable-length $\delta$-channel resolvability, the channel output is approximated by encoding a variable-length uniform random number under the constraint that the variational distance between the target and approximated distributions should be within a given constant $\delta$ asymptotically. In this paper, we assume that the given channel input is a mixed source whose components may be general sources. To analyze the minimum achievable length rate of the uniform random number, called the $\delta$-resolvability, we introduce a variant problem of the variable-length $\delta$-channel resolvability. A general formula for the $\delta$-resolvability in this variant problem is established for a general channel. When the channel is an identity mapping, it is shown that the $\delta$-resolvability in the original and variant problems coincide. This relation leads to a direct derivation of a single-letter formula for the $\delta$-resolvability when the given source is a mixed memoryless source. We extend the result to the second-order case. As a byproduct, we obtain the first-order and second-order formulas for fixed-to-variable length source coding allowing error probability up to $\delta$.;cs.IT
1801.04441;Secure Communications in NOMA System: Subcarrier Assignment and Power Allocation;Secure communication is a promising technology for wireless networks because it ensures secure transmission of information. In this paper, we investigate the joint subcarrier (SC) assignment and power allocation problem for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) amplify-and-forward two-way relay wireless networks, in the presence of eavesdroppers. By exploiting cooperative jamming (CJ) to enhance the security of the communication link, we aim to maximize the achievable secrecy energy efficiency by jointly designing the SC assignment, user pair scheduling and power allocation. Assuming the perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) at the relay station, we propose a low-complexity subcarrier assignment scheme (SCAS-1), which is equivalent to many-to-many matching games, and then SCAS-2 is formulated as a secrecy energy efficiency maximization problem. The secure power allocation problem is modeled as a convex geometric programming problem, and then solved by interior point methods. Simulation results demonstrate that the effectiveness of the proposed SSPA algorithms under scenarios of using and not using CJ, respectively.;cs.IT
1801.04443;$L^{2}$ harmonic forms on complete special holonomy manifolds;In this article, we consider $L^{2}$ harmonic forms on a complete non-compact Riemannian manifold $X$ with a nonzero parallel form $\omega$. The main result is that if $(X,\omega)$ is a complete $G_{2}$- ( or $Spin(7)$-) manifold with a $d$(linear) $G_{2}$- (or $Spin(7)$-) structure form $\omega$, the $L^{2}$ harmonic $2$-forms on $X$ will be vanish. As an application, we prove that the instanton equation with square integrable curvature on $(X,\omega)$ only has trivial solution. We would also consider the Hodge theory on the principal $G$-bundle $E$ over $(X,\omega)$.;math.DG
1801.04444;Double Dirichlet series associated with arithmetic functions;We consider double Dirichlet series associated with arithmetic functions such as the von Mangoldt function, the M\"obius function, and so on. We show analytic continuations of them by use of the Mellin-Barnes integral. Furthermore we observe their reverse values at non-positive integer points.;math.NT
1801.04445;On distributional chaos in non-autonomous discrete systems;This paper studies distributional chaos in non-autonomous discrete systems generated by given sequences of maps in metric spaces. In the case that the metric space is compact, it is shown that a system is Li-Yorke{\delta}-chaotic if and only if it is distributionally{\delta}'-chaotic in a sequence, and three criteria of distributional {\delta}-chaos are established, which are caused by topologically weak mixing, asymptotic average shadowing property, and some expanding condition, respectively, where {\delta} and {\delta}' are positive constants. In a general case, a criterion of distributional chaos in a sequence induced by a Xiong chaotic set is established.;math.DS
1801.04447;The existence of horizontal envelopes in the 3D-Heisenberg group;By using the support function on the $xy$-plane, we show the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of envelopes of horizontal lines in the 3D-Heisenberg group. A method to construct horizontal envelopes from the given ones is also derived, and we classify the solutions satisfying the construction.;math.DG
1801.04449;Uniqueness and reconstruction for the fractional Calder&#xf3,n problem with a single measurement;We show global uniqueness in the fractional Calder\'on problem with a single measurement and with data on arbitrary, possibly disjoint subsets of the exterior. The previous work \cite{GhoshSaloUhlmann} considered the case of infinitely many measurements. The method is again based on the strong uniqueness properties for the fractional equation, this time combined with a unique continuation principle from sets of measure zero. We also give a constructive procedure for determining an unknown potential from a single exterior measurement, based on constructive versions of the unique continuation result that involve different regularization schemes.;math.AP
1801.04450;The mixed Tate property of reductive groups;This thesis is concerned with the mixed Tate property of reductive algebraic groups $G$, which in particular guarantees a Chow Kunneth property for the classifying space $BG$. Toward this goal, we first refine the construction of the compactly supported motive of a quotient stack. <br />In the first section, we construct the compactly supported motive $M^c(X)$ of an algebraic space $X$ and demonstrate that it satisfies expected properties, following closely Voevodsky's work in the case of schemes. <br />In the second section, we construct a functorial version of Totaro's definition of the compactly supported motive $M^c([X/G])$ for any quotient stack $[X/G]$ where $X$ is an algebraic space and $G$ is an affine group scheme acting on it. A consequence of functoriality is a localization triangle for these motives. <br />In the third section, we study the mixed Tate property for the classical groups as well as the exceptional group $G_2$. For these groups, we demonstrate that all split forms satisfy the mixed Tate property, while exhibiting non-split forms that do not. Finally, we prove that for any affine group scheme $G$ and normal split unipotent subgroup $J$ of $G$, the motives $M^c(BG)$ and $M^c(B(G/J))$ are isomorphic.;math.AG
1801.04459;Graph Laplace and Markov operators on a measure space;The main goal of this paper is to build a measurable analogue to the theory of weighted networks on infinite graphs. Our basic setting is an infinite $\sigma$-finite measure space $(V, \mathcal B, \mu)$ and a symmetric measure $\rho$ on $(V\times V, \mathcal B\times \mathcal B)$ supported by a measurable symmetric subset $E\subset V\times V$. This applies to such diverse areas as optimization, graphons (limits of finite graphs), symbolic dynamics, measurable equivalence relations, to determinantal processes, to jump-processes, and it extends earlier studies of infinite graphs $G = (V, E)$ which are endowed with a symmetric weight function $c_{xy}$ defined on the set of edges $E$. As in the theory of weighted networks, we consider the Hilbert spaces $L^2(\mu), L^2(c\mu)$ and define two other Hilbert spaces, the dissipation space $Diss$ and finite energy space $\mathcal H_E$. Our main results include a number of explicit spectral theoretic and potential theoretic theorems that apply to two realizations of Laplace operators, and the associated jump-diffusion semigroups, one in $L^2(\mu)$, and, the second, its counterpart in $\mathcal H_E$. We show in particular that it is the second setting (the energy-Hilbert space and the dissipation Hilbert space) which is needed in a detailed study of transient Markov processes.;math.FA
1801.04462;Boolean functions: noise stability, non-interactive correlation distillation, and mutual information;Let $T_{\epsilon}$ be the noise operator acting on Boolean functions $f:\{0, 1\}^n\to \{0, 1\}$, where $\epsilon\in[0, 1/2]$ is the noise parameter. Given $\alpha&gt,1$ and fixed mean $\mathbb{E} f$, which Boolean function $f$ has the largest $\alpha$-th moment $\mathbb{E}(T_\epsilon f)^\alpha$? This question has close connections with noise stability of Boolean functions, the problem of non-interactive correlation distillation, and Courtade-Kumar's conjecture on the most informative Boolean function. In this paper, we characterize maximizers in some extremal settings, such as low noise ($\epsilon=\epsilon(n)$ is close to 0), high noise ($\epsilon=\epsilon(n)$ is close to 1/2), as well as when $\alpha=\alpha(n)$ is large. Analogous results are also established in more general contexts, such as Boolean functions defined on discrete torus $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^n$ and the problem of noise stability in a tree model.;math.PR
1801.04463;A Belief Propagation Algorithm for Multipath-Based SLAM;We present a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm that is based on radio signals and the association of specular multipath components (MPCs) with geometric features. Especially in indoor scenarios, robust localization from radio signals is challenging due to diffuse multipath propagation, unknown MPC-feature association, and limited visibility of features. In our approach, specular reflections at flat surfaces are described in terms of virtual anchors (VAs) that are mirror images of the physical anchors (PAs). The positions of these VAs and possibly also of the PAs are unknown. We develop a Bayesian model of the SLAM problem and represent it by a factor graph, which enables the use of belief propagation (BP) for efficient marginalization of the joint posterior distribution. The resulting BP-based SLAM algorithm detects the VAs associated with the PAs and estimates jointly the time-varying position of the mobile agent and the positions of the VAs and possibly also of the PAs, thereby leveraging the MPCs in the radio signal for improved accuracy and robustness of agent localization. The algorithm has a low computational complexity and scales well in all relevant system parameters. Experimental results using both synthetic measurements and real ultra-wideband radio signals demonstrate the excellent performance of the algorithm in challenging indoor environments.;cs.IT
1801.04466;Lattice Erasure Codes of Low Rank with Noise Margins;We consider the following generalization of an $(n,k)$ MDS code for application to an erasure channel with additive noise. Like an MDS code, our code is required to be decodable from any $k$ received symbols, in the absence of noise. In addition, we require that the noise margin for every allowable erasure pattern be as large as possible and that the code satisfy a power constraint. In this paper we derive performance bounds and present a few designs for low rank lattice codes for an additive noise channel with erasures.;cs.IT
1801.04469;On the equivalence of the Mizoguchi-Takahashi locally contractive map to Nadler&#x27,s locally contractive map;In this article, we have proved the equivalence between the Mizoguchi-Takahashi uniformly~locally~contractive map to the multi-valued map satisfying the Nadler contractive condition uniformly~locally~on a metrically convex space.;math.FA
1801.04474;An invariant related to the existence of conformally compact Einstein fillings;We define an invariant for compact spin manifolds $X$ of dimension $4k$ equipped with a metric $h$ of positive Yamabe invariant on its boundary. The vanishing of this invariant is a necessary condition for the conformal class of $h$ to be the conformal infinity of a conformally compact Einstein metric on $X$.;math.DG
1801.04475;On fully residually-$\mathcal{R}$ groups;We consider the class $\mathcal{R}$ of finitely generated toral relatively hyperbolic groups. We show that groups from $\mathcal{R}$ are commutative transitive and generalize a theorem proved by Benjamin Baumslag to this class. We also discuss two definitions of (fully) residually-$\mathcal{C}$ groups and prove the equivalence of the two definitions for $\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{R}$. This is a generalization of the similar result obtained by Ol'shanskii for $\mathcal{C}$ being the class of torsion-free hyperbolic groups. Let $\Gamma\in\mathcal{R}$ be non-abelian and non-elementary. We prove that every finitely generated fully residually-$\Gamma$ group embeds into a group from $\mathcal{R}$. On the other hand, we give an example of a finitely generated torsion-free fully residually-$\mathcal{H}$ group that does not embed into a group from $\mathcal{R}$, $\mathcal{H}$ is the class of hyperbolic groups.;math.GR
1801.04476;Cosupports and minimal pure-injective resolutions of affine rings;We prove that any affine ring $R$ over a field $k$ has full cosupport, i.e., the cosupport of $R$ is equal to ${\rm Spec}\, R$. Using this fact, we give a complete description of all terms in a minimal pure-injective resolution of $R$, provided that $|k|=\aleph_1$ and ${\rm dim}\, R\geq 2$, or $|k|\geq \aleph_1$ and ${\rm dim}\, R=2$. As a corollary, we obtain a partial answer to a conjecture by Gruson.;math.AC
1801.04477;Dimension Reduction for the Landau-de Gennes Model: The Vanishing Nematic Correlation Length Limit;We study nematic liquid crystalline films within the framework of the Landau-de Gennes theory in the limit when both the thickness of the film and the nematic correlation length are vanishingly small compared to the lateral extent of the film. We prove $\Gamma$-convergence for a sequence of singularly perturbed functionals with a potential vanishing on a high-dimensional set and a Dirichlet condition imposed on admissible functions. This then allows us to prove the existence of local minimizers of the Landau-de Gennes energy in the spirit of a theorem due to Kohn and Sternberg despite the lack of compactness arising from the high-dimensional structure of the wells. The limiting energy consists of leading order perimeter terms, similar to Allen-Cahn models, and lower order terms arising from vortex structures reminiscent of Ginzburg-Landau models.;math.AP
1801.04481;Density of power-free values of polynomials;We establish asymptotic formulae for the number of $k$-free values of polynmilas $F(x_1,\cdots,x_n)\in\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\cdots,x_n]$ of degree $d\geq 2$ for any $n\geq 1$, including when the variables are prime, as long as $k\geq (3d+1)/4$. Thus we generalize a work of Browning, while we use a different sieveing technique for the middle range of primes.;math.NT
1801.04483;Waring&#x27,s Theorem for Binary Powers;A natural number is a binary $k$'th power if its binary representation consists of $k$ consecutive identical blocks. We prove an analogue of Waring's theorem for sums of binary $k$'th powers. More precisely, we show that for each integer $k \geq 2$, there exists a positive integer $W(k)$ such that every sufficiently large multiple of $E_k := \gcd(2^k - 1, k)$ is the sum of at most $W(k)$ binary $k$'th powers. (The hypothesis of being a multiple of $E_k$ cannot be omitted, since we show that the $\gcd$ of the binary $k$'th powers is $E_k$.) Also, we explain how our results can be extended to arbitrary integer bases $b &gt, 2$.;math.NT
1801.04484;2D problems in groups;We investigate a conjecture about stabilisation of deficiency in finite index subgroups and relate it to the D2 Problem of C.T.C. Wall and the Relation Gap problem. We verify the pro-$p$ version of the conjecture, as well as its higher dimensional abstract analogues.;math.GR
1801.04485;Persistence of one-dimensional AR(1)-sequences;For a class of one-dimensional autoregressive processes $(X_n)$ we consider the tail behaviour of the stopping time $T_0=\min \lbrace n\geq 1: X_n\leq 0 \rbrace$. We discuss existing general analytical approaches to this and related problems and propose a new one, which is based on a renewal-type decomposition for the moment generating function of $T_0$ and on the analytical Fredholm alternative. Using this method, we show that $\mathbb{P}_x(T_0=n)\sim V(x)R_0^n$ for some $0&lt,R_0&lt,1$ and a positive $R^{-1}_0$-harmonic function $V$. Further we prove that our conditions on the tail behaviour of the innovations are sharp in the sense that fatter tails produce non-exponential decay factors.;math.PR
1801.04488;An asymptotically compatible meshfree quadrature rule for non-local problems with applications to peridynamics;We present a meshfree quadrature rule for compactly supported non-local integro-differential equations (IDEs) with radial kernels. We apply this rule to develop a strong-form meshfree discretization of a peridynamic solid mechanics model that requires no background mesh. Existing discretizations of peridynamic models have been shown to exhibit a lack of asymptotic compatibility to the corresponding linearly elastic local solution. By posing the quadrature rule as an equality constrained least squares problem, we obtain asymptotically compatible convergence via reproducability constraints. Our approach naturally handles traction-free conditions, surface effects, and damage modeling for both static and dynamic problems. We demonstrate high-order convergence to the local theory by comparing to manufactured solutions and to cases with crack singularities for which an analytic solution is available. Finally, we verify the applicability of the approach to realistic problems by reproducing high-velocity impact results from the Kalthoff-Winkler experiments.;math.NA
1801.04489;A Stochastic Singular Vector Based MIMO Channel Model for MAC Layer Tracking;A novel stochastic technique is presented to directly model singular vectors and singular values of a multiple input multiple output channel. Thus the component smodeled directly in the eigen domain can be adapted to exhibit realistic physical domain behavior when assembled. The model exploites natural paths of eigenmodes, such that a simple Doppler filter generator process can be used. Furthermore it is possible to directly manipulate the singular vector dynamics in a way that an unrealistic "stress channel" can be modeled in the eigen domain. This is particularly useful for testing the eigenmode channel tracking ability internal to a communication device such as a modem, where impairments in tracking will cause interference between eigenmodes. The model can also facilitate mode tracking testing as it directly produces tracked ungtangled eigenmodes, providing the narrowest possible singular vector Doppler spectra and consequently lowest required update rates of each eigenmode. The singular vector based model targets testing of the eigen domain functionality of MIMO modems/devices, an apparatus focus, without the need for including the decomposition stages.;cs.IT
1801.04491;Irreversible investment with fixed adjustment costs: a stochastic impulse control approach;We consider an optimal stochastic impulse control problem over an infinite time horizon motivated by a model of irreversible investment choices with fixed adjustment costs. By employing techniques of viscosity solutions and relying on semiconvexity arguments, we prove that the value function is a classical solution to the associated quasi-variational inequality. This enables us to characterize the structure of the continuation and action regions and construct an optimal control. Finally, we focus on the linear case, discussing, by a numerical analysis, the sensitivity of the solution with respect to the relevant parameters of the problem.;math.OC
1801.04492;An Explicit Convergence Rate for Nesterov&#x27,s Method from SDP;The framework of Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQC) introduced by Lessard et al. (2014) reduces the computation of upper bounds on the convergence rate of several optimization algorithms to semi-definite programming (SDP). In particular, this technique was applied to Nesterov's accelerated method (NAM). For quadratic functions, this SDP was explicitly solved leading to a new bound on the convergence rate of NAM, and for arbitrary strongly convex functions it was shown numerically that IQC can improve bounds from Nesterov (2004). Unfortunately, an explicit analytic solution to the SDP was not provided. In this paper, we provide such an analytical solution, obtaining a new general and explicit upper bound on the convergence rate of NAM, which we further optimize over its parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best, and explicit, upper bound on the convergence rate of NAM for strongly convex functions.;math.OC
1801.04495;Model Predictive Control in Spacecraft Rendezvous and Soft Docking;This paper discusses translation and attitude control in spacecraft rendezvous and soft docking. The target spacecraft orbit can be either circular or elliptic. The high fidelity model for this problem is intrinsically a nonlinear system but can be viewed as a linear time varying system (LTV). Therefore, a model predictive control (MPC) based design is proposed to deal with the time-varying feature of the problem. A robust pole assignment method is used in the MPC-based design because of the following merits and/or considerations: (a) no overshoot of the relative position and attitude between the target and the chaser to achieve soft docking by placing all closed-loop poles in the negative real axis of the complex plan, which avoids oscillation of the relative position and attitude, in particular, in the final stage, (b) fast on-line computation, (c) modeling error tolerance, and (d) disturbance rejection. We will discuss these considerations and merits, and use a design simulation to demonstrate that the desired performance is indeed achieved.;math.OC
1801.04500;A forcing relation of braids from Nielsen fixed point theory;In this paper, we focus our attention on the connections between the braid group and the Nielsen fixed point theory.

1801.04501;Extinction and coming down from infinity of CB-processes with competition in a L&#xe9,vy environment;In this note, we are interested on the event of extinction and the property of coming down from infinity of continuous state branching (or CB for short) processes with competition in a L\'evy environment whose branching mechanism satisfies the so-called Grey's condition. In particular, we deduce, under the assumption that the L\'evy environment does not drift towards infinity, that for any starting point the process becomes extinct in finite time a.s. Moreover if we impose an integrability condition on the competition mechanism, then the process comes down from infinity regardless the long term behaviour of the environment.;math.PR
1801.04502;Saturated configuration and new large construction of equiangular lines;A set of lines through the origin in Euclidean space is called equiangular when any pair of lines from the set intersects with each other at a common angle. We study the maximum size of equiangular lines in Euclidean space and use graph theoretic approach to prove that all the currently known construction for maximum equiangular lines in $\mathbb R^d$ cannot add another line to form a larger equiangular set of lines if $14 \leq d \leq 20$ and $d \neq 15$. We give new constructions of large equiangular lines which are 248 equiangular lines in $\mathbb R^{42}$, 200 equiangular lines in $\mathbb{R}^{41}$, 168 equiangular lines in $\mathbb{R}^{40}$, 152 equiangular lines in $\mathbb R^{39}$ with angle $1/7$, and 56 equiangular lines in $\mathbb R^{18}$ with angle $1/5$.;math.CO
1801.04504;Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for mmWave Drone Networks with Limited Feedback;Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) base stations (BSs) can be a promising solution to provide connectivity and quality of service (QoS) guarantees during temporary events and after disasters. In this paper, we consider a scenario where UAV-BSs are serving large number of mobile users in a hot spot area (e.g., in a stadium). We introduce non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission at UAV-BSs to serve more users simultaneously considering user distances as the available feedback for user ordering during NOMA formulation. With millimeter-wave (mmWave) transmission and multi-antenna techniques, we assume UAV-BS generates directional beams and multiple users are served simultaneously within the same beam. However, due to the limitations of physical vertical beamwidth of the UAV-BS beam, it may not be possible to cover the entire user region at UAV altitudes of practical relevance. During such situations, a beam scanning approach is proposed to maximize the achievable sum rates. We develop a comprehensive framework over which outage probabilities and respective sum rates are derived rigorously and we investigate the optimal operational altitude of UAV-BS to maximize the sum rates using our analytical framework. Our analysis shows that NOMA with distance feedback can provide better outage sum rates compared to orthogonal multiple access.;cs.IT
1801.04507;Schwarz type lemma, Landau type theorem and Lipschitz type space of solutions to biharmonic equations;The purpose of this paper is to study the properties of the solutions to the biharmonic equations: $\Delta(\Delta f)=g$, where $g:$ $\overline{\mathbb{D}}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ is a continuous function and $\overline{\mathbb{D}}$ denotes the closure of the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$ in the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$. In fact, we establish the following properties for those solutions: Firstly, we establish the Schwarz type lemma. Secondly, by using the obtained results, we get a Landau type theorem. Thirdly, we discuss their Lipschitz type property.;math.CV
1801.04509;Admissible sequences for positive operators;A sequence of scalars is said to be admissible for a positive operator A on a Hilbert space if it is the diagonal of VAV* for some partial isometry V having as domain the closure of the range of A. When A is a projection, the celebrated Kadison's carpenter theorem provides a sufficient condition for a sequence to be admissible for A. We prove that the same condition is sufficient for the sequence to be admissible for A when A is a sum of projections (converging in the SOT). This provides an independent proof of Kadison's carpenter theorem.;math.OA
1801.04511;Regularity of Desingularised Models for Vortex Filaments in Incompressible Viscous Flows: A Geometrical Approach;We establish the regularity of weak solutions for the vorticity equation associated to a family of desingularised models for vortex filament dynamics in 3D incompressible viscous flows. These include and generalise the classical model "of an allowance for the thickness of the vortices" due to Louis Rosenhead in 1930. Our approach is based on an interplay between the geometry of vorticity and analytic inequalities in Sobolev spaces.;math.AP
1801.04512;Boundary Regularity for Asymptotically Hyperbolic Metrics with Smooth Weyl Curvature;In this paper, we study the regularity of asymptotically hyperbolic metrics with Einstein condition near boundary and Weyl curvature smooth enough in arbitrary dimension. Following Michael Anderson's method, we show that $C^{m,\alpha}$ conformally compact Riemannian metrics with Einstein equation vanishing to finite order near boundary have conformal compactifications that are $C^{m+2,\alpha}$ up to the boundary when Weyl curvature is in $C^{m,\alpha}$ and the boundary metric is in $C^{m+2,\alpha}$ where $m\geq 3.$;math.DG
1801.04517;Polynomial stability of exact solution and a numerical method for stochastic differential equations with time-dependent delay;Polynomial stability of exact solution and modified truncated Euler-Maruyama method for stochastic differential equations with time-dependent delay are investigated in this paper. By using the well known discrete semimartingale convergence theorem, sufficient conditions are obtained for both bounded and unbounded delay $\delta$ to ensure the polynomial stability of the corresponding numerical approximation. Examples are presented to illustrate the conclusion.;math.PR
1801.04519;Linear maps preserve the covariance sets;Let $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$\ are $C^{{\huge \ast}}% $-algebras\textbf{.} A\textbf{ }linear map $\phi:\mathcal{A\rightarrow B}$ is $C^{\ast}$-Jordan homomorphism if it is a Jordan homomorphism which preserves the adjoint operation.

1801.04525;Covariance in the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism and the Maurer-Cartan equation for curved Lie algebras;We express covariance of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism in classical mechanics by means of the Maurer-Cartan equation in a curved Lie superalgebra, defined using the formal variational calculus and Sullivan's Thom-Whitney construction. We use this framework to construct a Batalin-Vilkovisky canonical transformation identifying the Batalin-Vilkovisky formulation of the spinning particle with an AKSZ field theory.;math-ph
1801.04527;The maximum diam theorem on Finsler manifolds;We prove that, for a Finsler space, if the weighted Ricci curvature is bounded below by a positive number and the diam attains its maximal value, then it is isometric to a standard Finsler sphere. As an application, we show that the first eigenvalue of the Finsler-Laplacian attains its lower bound if and only if the Finsler manifold is isometric to a standard Finsler sphere, and moreover, we obtain an explicit 1-st eigenfunction on the sphere.;math.DG
1801.04531;Regularity of stochastic nonlocal diffusion equations;In this paper, we are concerned with regularity of nonlocal stochastic partial differential equations of parabolic type. By using Companato estimates and Sobolev embedding theorem, we first show the H\"{o}lder continuity (locally in the whole state space $\mathbb{R}^d$) for mild solutions of stochastic nonlocal diffusion equations in the sense that the solutions $u$ belong to the space $C^{\gamma}(D_T,L^p(\Omega))$ with the optimal H\"{o}lder continuity index $\gamma$ (which is given explicitly), where $D_T:=[0,T]\times D$ for $T&gt,0$, and $D\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ being a bounded domain. Then, by utilising tail estimates, we are able to obtain the estimates of mild solutions in $L^p(\Omega,C^{\gamma^*}(D_T))$. What's more, we give an explicit formula between the two index $\gamma$ and $\gamma^*$. Moreover, we prove H\"{o}lder continuity for mild solutions on bounded domains. Finally, we present a new criteria to justify H\"{o}lder continuity for the solutions on bounded domains. The novelty of this paper is that our method are suitable to the case of time-space white noise.;math.PR
1801.04537;Compressed Neighbour Discovery using Sparse Kerdock Matrices;We study the network-wide neighbour discovery problem in wireless networks in which each node in a network must discovery the network interface addresses (NIAs) of its neighbours. We work within the rapid on-off division duplex framework proposed by Guo and Zhang (2010) in which all nodes are assigned different on-off signatures which allow them listen to the transmissions of neighbouring nodes during their off slots, leading to a compressed sensing problem at each node with a collapsed codebook determined by a given node's transmission signature. We propose sparse Kerdock matrices as codebooks for the neighbour discovery problem. These matrices share the same row space as certain Delsarte-Goethals frames based upon Reed Muller codes, whilst at the same time being extremely sparse. We present numerical experiments using two different compressed sensing recovery algorithms, One Step Thresholding (OST) and Normalised Iterative Hard Thresholding (NIHT). For both algorithms, a higher proportion of neighbours are successfully identified using sparse Kerdock matrices compared to codebooks based on Reed Muller codes with random erasures as proposed by Zhang and Guo (2011). We argue that the improvement is due to the better interference cancellation properties of sparse Kerdock matrices when collapsed according to a given node's transmission signature. We show by explicit calculation that the coherence of the collapsed codebooks resulting from sparse Kerdock matrices remains near-optimal.;cs.IT
1801.04545;Throughput Maximization for UAV-Enabled Wireless Powered Communication Networks;This paper studies an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless powered communication network (WPCN), in which a UAV is dispatched as a mobile access point (AP) to serve a set of ground users periodically. The UAV employs the radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) to charge the users in the downlink, and the users use the harvested RF energy to send independent information to the UAV in the uplink. Unlike the conventional WPCN with fixed APs, the UAV-enabled WPCN can exploit the mobility of the UAV via trajectory design, jointly with the wireless resource allocation optimization, to maximize the system throughput. In particular, we aim to maximize the uplink common (minimum) throughput among all ground users over a finite UAV's flight period, subject to its maximum speed constraint and the users' energy neutrality constraints. The resulted problem is non-convex and thus difficult to be solved optimally. To tackle this challenge, we first consider an ideal case without the UAV's maximum speed constraint, and obtain the optimal solution to the relaxed problem. The optimal solution shows that the UAV should successively hover above a finite number of ground locations for downlink WPT, as well as above each of the ground users for uplink communication. Next, we consider the general problem with the UAV's maximum speed constraint. Based on the above multi-location-hovering solution, we first propose an efficient successive hover-and-fly trajectory design, jointly with the downlink and uplink wireless resource allocation, and then propose a locally optimal solution by applying the techniques of alternating optimization and successive convex programming (SCP). Numerical results show that the proposed UAV-enabled WPCN achieves significant throughput gains over the conventional WPCN with fixed-location AP.;cs.IT
1801.04548;Frame Moments and Welch Bound with Erasures;The Welch Bound is a lower bound on the root mean square cross correlation between $n$ unit-norm vectors $f_1,...,f_n$ in the $m$ dimensional space ($\mathbb{R} ^m$ or $\mathbb{C} ^m$), for $n\geq m$. Letting $F = [f_1|...|f_n]$ denote the $m$-by-$n$ frame matrix, the Welch bound can be viewed as a lower bound on the second moment of $F$, namely on the trace of the squared Gram matrix $(F'F)^2$. We consider an erasure setting, in which a reduced frame, composed of a random subset of Bernoulli selected vectors, is of interest. We extend the Welch bound to this setting and present the {\em erasure Welch bound} on the expected value of the Gram matrix of the reduced frame. Interestingly, this bound generalizes to the $d$-th order moment of $F$. We provide simple, explicit formulae for the generalized bound for $d=2,3,4$, which is the sum of the $d$-th moment of Wachter's classical MANOVA distribution and a vanishing term (as $n$ goes to infinity with $\frac{m}{n}$ held constant). The bound holds with equality if (and for $d = 4$ only if) $F$ is an Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF). Our results offer a novel perspective on the superiority of ETFs over other frames in a variety of applications, including spread spectrum communications, compressed sensing and analog coding.;cs.IT
1801.04549;Divergent Trajectories in Arithmetic Homogeneous Spaces of Rational Rank Two;Let $G$ be a real algebraic group defined over $\mathbb{Q}$, $\Gamma$ be an arithmetic subgroup of $G$, and $T$ be a maximal $\mathbb{R}$-split torus. A trajectory in $G/\Gamma$ is divergent if eventually it leaves every compact subset. In some cases there is a finite collection of explicit algebraic data which account for the divergence. If this is the case, the divergent trajectory is called obvious. Given a closed cone in $T$, we study the existence of non-obvious divergent trajectories under its action in $G/\Gamma$. We get a sufficient condition for the existence of a non-obvious divergence trajectory in the general case, and a full classification under the assumption that $\mbox{rank}_{\mathbb{Q}}G=\mbox{rank}_{\mathbb{R}}G=2$.;math.DS
1801.04550;Properties of non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials at $q=1$ and $q=0$;We examine the non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials $E_\lambda(x,q,t)$ at $q=1$, as well as the more general permuted-basement Macdonald polynomials. When $q=1$, we show that $E_\lambda(x,1,t)$ is symmetric and independent of $t$ whenever $\lambda$ is a partition. Furthermore, we show that for general $\lambda$, this expression factors into a symmetric and a non-symmetric part, where the symmetric part is independent of $t$, while the non-symmetric part only depends on the relative order of the entries in $\lambda$. <br />We also examine the case $q=0$, which give rise to so called permuted-basement $t$-atoms. We prove expansion-properties of these, and as a corollary, prove that Demazure characters (key polynomials) expand positively into permuted-basement atoms. This complements the result that permuted-basement atoms are atom-positive. Finally, we show that a product of a permuted-basement atom and a Schur polynomial is again positive in the same permuted-basement atom basis, and thus interpolates between two results by Haglund, Luoto, Mason and van Willigenburg. <br />The common theme in this project is the application of basement-permuting operators as well as combinatorics on fillings, by applying results in a previous article by the first author.;math.CO
1801.04551;On Congruence Permutable $G$-sets;An algebraic structure is said to be congruence permutable if its arbitrary congruences $\alpha$ and $\beta$ satisfy the equation $\alpha \circ \beta =\beta \circ \alpha$, where $\circ$ denotes the usual composition of binary relations. For an arbitrary $G$-set $X$ with $G\cap X=\emptyset$, we define a semigroup $(G,X,0)$ with a zero $0$ ($0\notin G\cup X$), and give necessary and sufficient conditions for the congruence permutability of the $G$-set $X$ by the help of the semigroup $(G,X,0)$.;math.GR
1801.04552;Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation in NOMA Heterogeneous Networks;Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has attracted much recent attention owing to its capability for improving the system spectral efficiency in wireless communications. Deploying NOMA in heterogeneous network can satisfy users' explosive data traffic requirements, and NOMA will likely play an important role in the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication networks. However, NOMA brings new technical challenges on resource allocation due to the mutual cross-tier interference in heterogeneous networks. In this article, to study the tradeoff between data rate performance and energy consumption in NOMA, we examine the problem of energy-efficient user scheduling and power optimization in 5G NOMA heterogeneous networks. The energy-efficient user scheduling and power allocation schemes are introduced for the downlink 5G NOMA heterogeneous network for perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) respectively. Simulation results show that the resource allocation schemes can significantly increase the energy efficiency of 5G NOMA heterogeneous network for both cases of perfect CSI and imperfect CSI.;cs.IT
1801.04555;Remarks on Graphons;The notion of the graphon (a symmetric measurable fuzzy set of $[0, 1]^2$) was introduced by L. Lov\'asz and B. Szegedy in 2006 to describe limit objects of convergent sequences of dense graphs. In their investigation the integral \[t(F,W)=\int _{[0, 1]^k}\prod _{ij\in E(F)}W(x_i,x_j)dx_1dx_2\cdots dx_k\] plays an important role in which $W$ is a graphon and $E(F)$ denotes the set of all edges of a $k$-labelled simple graph $F$. In our present paper we show that the set of all fuzzy sets of $[0, 1]^2$ is a right regular band with respect to the operation $\circ$ defined by \[(f\circ g)(s,t)=\vee _{(x,y)\in [0, 1]^2}(f(x,y)\wedge g(s,t)),\quad (s, t)\in [0, 1]^2,\] and the set of all graphons is a left ideal of this band. We prove that, if $W$ is an arbitrary graphon and $f$ is a fuzzy set of $[0, 1]^2$, then \[|t(F, W)-t(F, f\circ W)|\leq |E(F)|(\sup(W)-\sup(f))\Delta (\{W&gt, \sup(f)\} )\] for arbitrary finite simple graphs $F$, where $\Delta (\{W&gt, \sup(f)\})$ denotes the area of the set $\{W&gt,\sup(f)\}$ of all $(x, y)\in [0, 1]^2$ satisfying $W(x,y)&gt,\sup(f)$.;math.CO
1801.04556;Poisson Cox Point Processes for Vehicular Networks;This paper analyzes statistical properties of the Poisson line Cox point process useful in the modeling of vehicular networks. The point process is created by a two-stage construction: a Poisson line process to model road infrastructure and independent Poisson point processes, conditionally on the Poisson lines, to model vehicles on the roads. We derive basic properties of the point process, including the general quadratic position of the points, the nearest distance distribution, the Laplace functional, the densities of facets of the Cox-Voronoi tessellation, and the asymptotic behavior of the typical Voronoi cell under vehicular densification. These properties are closely linked to features that are important in vehicular networks.;cs.IT
1801.04558;On the effect of blockage objects in dense MIMO SWIPT networks;Simultaneous information and power transfer (SWIPT) is characterised by the ambiguous role of multi-user interference. In short, the beneficial effect of multi-user interference on RF energy harvesting is obtained at the price of a reduced link capacity, thus originating nontrivial trade-offs between the achievable information rate and the harvestable energy. Arguably, in indoor environments, this trade-off might be affected by the propagation loss due to blockage objects like walls. Hence, a couple of fundamental questions arise. How much must the network elements be densified to counteract the blockage attenuation? Is blockage always detrimental on the achievable rate-energy trade-off? In this paper, we analyse the performance of an indoor multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) SWIPT-enabled network in the attempt to shed a light of those questions. The effects of the obstacles are examined with the help of a stochastic approach in which energy transmitters (also referred to as power heads) are located by using a Poisson Point Process and walls are generated through a Manhattan Poisson Line Process. The stochastic behaviour of the signal attenuation and the multi-user interference is studied to obtain the Joint Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (J-CCDF) of information rate and harvested power. Theoretical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Eventually, the rate-energy trade-off is presented as a function of the frequency of walls to emphasise the cross-dependences between the deployment of the network elements and the topology of the venue.;cs.IT
1801.04559;Asymptotic Enumeration of Graph Classes with Many Components;We consider graph classes $\mathcal G$ in which every graph has components in a class $\mathcal{C}$ of connected graphs. We provide a framework for the asymptotic study of $\lvert\mathcal{G}_{n,N}\rvert$, the number of graphs in $\mathcal{G}$ with $n$ vertices and $N:=\lfloor\lambda n\rfloor$ components, where $\lambda\in(0,1)$. Assuming that the number of graphs with $n$ vertices in $\mathcal{C}$ satisfies \begin{align*} \lvert \mathcal{C}_n\rvert\sim b n^{-(1+\alpha)}\rho^{-n}n!, \quad n\to \infty \end{align*} for some $b,\rho&gt,0$ and $\alpha&gt,1$ -- a property commonly encountered in graph enumeration -- we show that \begin{align*} \lvert\mathcal{G}_{n,N}\rvert\sim c(\lambda) n^{f(\lambda)} (\log n)^{g(\lambda)} \rho^{-n}h(\lambda)^{N}\frac{n!}{N!}, \quad n\to \infty \end{align*} for explicitly given $c(\lambda),f(\lambda),g(\lambda)$ and $h(\lambda)$. These functions are piecewise continuous with a discontinuity at a critical value $\lambda^{*}$, which we also determine. The central idea in our approach is to sample objects of $\cal G$ randomly by so-called Boltzmann generators in order to translate enumerative problems to the analysis of iid random variables. By that we are able to exploit local limit theorems and large deviation results well-known from probability theory to prove our claims. The main results are formulated for generic combinatorial classes satisfying the SET-construction.;math.CO

1801.04561;Regular orbits of sporadic simple groups;Given a finite group $G$ and a faithful irreducible $FG$-module $V$ where $F$ has prime order, does $G$ have a regular orbit on $V$? This problem is equivalent to determining which primitive permutation groups of affine type have a base of size 2. Let $G$ be a covering group of an almost simple group whose socle $T$ is sporadic, and let $V$ be a faithful irreducible $FG$-module where $F$ has prime order dividing $|G|$. We classify the pairs $(G,V)$ for which $G$ has no regular orbit on $V$, and determine the minimal base size of $G$ in its action on $V$. To obtain this classification, for each non-trivial $g\in G/Z(G)$, we compute the minimal number of $T$-conjugates of $g$ generating $\langle T,g\rangle$.;math.RT

For symmetric banded matrices these novel approximations provide a computable reconstruction of the associated matrix function which exhibits decaying properties comparable to the best existing theoretical bounds. Numerical examples show the benefits of the proposed rational approximations w.r.t. the classical Taylor polynomials.;math.NA

1801.04578;Fixed angle scattering: recovery of singularities and its limitations;We prove that in dimension $n \ge 2$ the main singularities of a complex potential $q$ having a certain a priori regularity are contained in the Born approximation $q_\theta$ constructed from fixed angle scattering data. Moreover, ${q-q_\theta}$ can be up to one derivative more regular than $q$ in the Sobolev scale. In fact, this result is optimal, we construct a family of compactly supported and radial potentials for which it is not possible to have more than one derivative gain. Also, these functions show that for $n&gt,3$, the maximum derivative gain can be very small for potentials in the Sobolev scale not having a certain a priori level of regularity which grows with the dimension.;math.AP
1801.04579;Hadamard Star Configurations;Bocci, Carlini, and Kileel have shown that the square-free Hadamard product of a finite set of points $Z$ that all lie on a line $\ell$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$ produces a star configuration of codimension $n$. In this paper we introduce a construction using the Hadamard product to construct star configurations of codimension $c$. In the case that $c = n= 2$, our construction produces the star configurations of Bocci, Carlini, and Kileel. We will call any star configuration that can be constructed using our approach a Hadamard star configuration. Our main result is a classification of Hadamard star configurations.;math.AG

1801.04584;The method of hypergraph containers;In this survey we describe a recently-developed technique for bounding the number (and controlling the typical structure) of finite objects with forbidden substructures. This technique exploits a subtle clustering phenomenon exhibited by the independent sets of uniform hypergraphs whose edges are sufficiently evenly distributed, more precisely, it provides a relatively small family of 'containers' for the independent sets, each of which contains few edges. We attempt to convey to the reader a general high-level overview of the method, focusing on a small number of illustrative applications in areas such as extremal graph theory, Ramsey theory, additive combinatorics, and discrete geometry, and avoiding technical details as much as possible.;math.CO

Brezis and H.-M. Nguyen in a recent paper. These functionals Gamma-converge to a multiple of the Sobolev norm or the total variation, depending on a summability exponent, but the exact values of the constants are unknown in many cases. <br />We describe a new approach to the Gamma-convergence result that leads in some special cases to the exact value of the constants, and to the existence of smooth recovery families.;math.FA
1801.04593;On Identifying a Massive Number of Distributions;Finding the underlying probability distributions of a set of observed sequences under the constraint that each sequence is generated i.i.d by a distinct distribution is considered. The number of distributions, and hence the number of observed sequences, are let to grow with the observation blocklength $n$. Asymptotically matching upper and lower bounds on the probability of error are derived.;cs.IT
1801.04595;Engel elements in some fractal groups;Let $p$ be a prime and let $G$ be a subgroup of a Sylow pro-$p$ subgroup of the group of automorphisms of the $p$-adic tree. We prove that if $G$ is fractal and $|G':\mathrm{st}_G(1)'|=\infty$, then the set $L(G)$ of left Engel elements of $G$ is trivial. This result applies to fractal nonabelian groups with torsion-free abelianization, for example the Basilica group, the Brunner-Sidki-Vieira group, and also to the GGS-group with constant defining vector. <br />We further provide two examples showing that neither of the requirements $|G':\mathrm{st}_G(1)'|=\infty$ and being fractal can be dropped.;math.GR
1801.04596;Stochastic quantization of an Abelian gauge theory;We study the Langevin dynamics of a U(1) lattice gauge theory on the torus, and prove that they converge for short time in a suitable gauge to a system of stochastic PDEs driven by space-time white noises. This also yields convergence of some gauge invariant observables on a short time interval. We fix gauge via a DeTurck trick, and prove a version of Ward identity which results in cancellation of renormalization constants that would otherwise break gauge symmetry. The proof relies on a discrete version of the theory of regularity structures.;math.PR
1801.04599;The modal logic of arithmetic potentialism and the universal algorithm;I investigate the modal commitments of various conceptions of the philosophy of arithmetic potentialism. Specifically, I consider the natural potentialist systems arising from the models of arithmetic under their natural extension concepts, such as end-extensions, arbitrary extensions, conservative extensions and more. In these potentialist systems, I show, the propositional modal assertions that are valid with respect to all arithmetic assertions with parameters are exactly the assertions of S4. With respect to sentences, however, the validities of a model lie between S4 and S5, and these bounds are sharp in that there are models realizing both endpoints. For a model of arithmetic to validate S5 is precisely to fulfill the arithmetic maximality principle, which asserts that every possibly necessary statement is already true, and these models are equivalently characterized as those satisfying a maximal $\Sigma_1$ theory. The main S4 analysis makes fundamental use of the universal algorithm, of which this article provides a simplified, self-contained account. The paper concludes with a discussion of how the philosophical differences of several fundamentally different potentialist attitudes---linear inevitability, convergent potentialism and radical branching possibility---are expressed by their corresponding potentialist modal validities.;math.LO
1801.04605;Tribonacci numbers and primes of the form $p=x^2+11y^2$;In this paper we show that for any prime number $p$ not equal to $11$ or $19$, the Tribonacci number $T_{p-1}$ is divisible by $p$ if and only if $p$ is of the form $x^2+11y^2$. We first use class field theory on the Galois closure of the number field corresponding to the polynomial $x^3-x^2-x-1$ to give the splitting behavior of primes in this number field. After that, we apply these results to the explicit exponential formula for $T_{p-1}$. We also give a connection between the Tribonacci numbers and the Fourier coefficients of the unique newform of weight $2$ and level $11$.;math.NT
1801.04606;A functional limit theorem for the profile of random recursive trees;Let $X_n(k)$ be the number of vertices at level $k$ in a random recursive tree with $n+1$ vertices. We prove a functional limit theorem for the vector-valued process $(X_{[n^t]}(1),\ldots, X_{[n^t]}(k))_{t\geq 0}$, for each $k\in\mathbb N$. We show that after proper centering and normalization, this process converges weakly to a vector-valued Gaussian process whose components are integrated Brownian motions. This result is deduced from a functional limit theorem for Crump-Mode-Jagers branching processes generated by increasing random walks with increments that have finite second moment.;math.PR
1801.04611;On Newton-Okounkov bodies of Graded Linear Series;We generalize the theory of Newton-Okounkov bodies of big divisors to the case of graded linear series. One of the results is the generalization of slice formulas and the existence of generic Newton-Okounkov bodies for birational graded linear series. We also give a characterization of graded linear series which have full volume in terms of their base locus.;math.AG
1801.04612;The inverse spectral problem for periodic conservative multi-peakon solutions of the Camassa-Holm equation;We solve the inverse spectral problem associated with periodic conservative multi-peakon solutions of the Camassa-Holm equation. The corresponding isospectral sets can be identified with finite dimensional tori.;math.SP
1801.04614;Some Generalizations of Good Integers and Their Applications in the Study of Self-Dual Negacyclic Codes;Good integers introduced in 1997 form an interesting family of integers that has been continuously studied due to their rich number theoretical properties and wide applications. In this paper, we have focused on classes of $2^\beta$-good integers, $2^\beta$-oddly-good integers, and $2^\beta$-evenly-good integers which are generalizations of good integers. Properties of such integers have been given as well as their applications in characterizing and enumerating self-dual negacyclic codes over finite fields. An alternative proof for the characterization of the existence of a self-dual negacyclic code over finite fields has been given in terms of such generalized good integers. A general enumeration formula for the number of self-dual negacyclic codes of length $n$ over finite fields has been established. For some specific lengths, explicit formulas have been provided as well. Some known results on self-dual negacyclic codes over finite fields can be formalized and viewed as special cases of this work.;cs.IT
1801.04617;Some remarks on biased recursive trees;The purpose of this paper is to analyze certain statistics of a recently introduced non-uniform random tree model, biased recursive trees. This model is based on constructing a random tree by establishing a correspondence with non-uniform permutations, biased riffle shuffles. The statistics that are treated include the number of nodes with a given number of descendants, the depth of the tree, and the number of branches. The model yields the uniform recursive trees as a certain limit, some new results for the uniform case are obtained as well.;math.PR
1801.04621;Computing Shape DNA using the closest point method;We demonstrate an application of the closest point method where the truncated spectrum of the Laplace--Beltrami operator of an object is used to identify the object. The effectiveness of the method is analyzed as well as the default algorithm, `eigs', in MATLAB which computes the eigenvalues of a given matrix. We also cluster "similar" objects via multi-dimensional scaling algorithm and empirically measure its effectiveness.;math.NA
1801.04625;On difference operators for symmetric Krall-Hahn polynomials;The problem of finding measures whose orthogonal polynomials are also eigenfunctions of higher-order difference operators have been recently solved by multiplying the classical discrete measures by suitable polynomials. This problem was raised by Richard Askey in 1991. The case of the Hahn family is specially rich due to the number of parameters involved. These suitable polynomials are in the Hahn case generated from a quartet $F_1,F_2,F_3$ and $F_4$ of finite sets of positive integers. In this paper, we show that the order of the corresponding difference operators can be reduced by assuming certain symmetries on both, the parameters of the Krall-Hahn family and the associated quartet $F_1,F_2,F_3$ and $F_4$.;math.CA
1801.04626;On a discriminant knot group problem of Brieskorn;Quite some time ago, at the singularity conference at Carg\`ese 1972 Brieskorn asked the following question: <br />Is the local fundamental group $\pi_1^{s}(S-D)$ of the discriminant complement inside the semi-universal unfolding $S$ of an isolated hypersurface singularity constant for $s$ in the $\mu$-constant stratum $\Sigma_E$? <br />We review this question and give an affirmative answer in case of singular plane curve germs of multiplicity at most $3$.;math.AG
1801.04632;On symmetric matrices associated with oriented link diagrams;Let $D$ be an oriented link diagram with the set of regions $\operatorname{r}_{D}$. We define a symmetric map (or matrix) $\operatorname{\tau}_{D}\colon\operatorname{r}_{D}\times \operatorname{r}_{D} \to \mathbb{Z}[x]$ that gives rise to an invariant of oriented links, based on a slightly modified $S$-equivalence of Trotter and Murasugi in the space of symmetric matrices. In particular, for real $x$, the negative signature of $\operatorname{\tau}_{D}$ corrected by the writhe is conjecturally twice the Tristram--Levine signature function, where $2x=\sqrt{t}+\frac1{\sqrt{t}}$ with $t$ being the indeterminate of the Alexander polynomial.;math.GT
1801.04633;Chain level loop bracket and pseudo-holomorphic disks;Let $L$ be a Lagrangian submanifold in a symplectic vector space which is closed, oriented and spin. Using virtual fundamental chains of moduli spaces of nonconstant pseudo-holomorphic disks with boundaries on $L$, one can define a Maurer-Cartan element of a Lie bracket operation in string topology (the loop bracket) defined at chain level. This observation is due to Fukaya, who also pointed out its important consequences in symplectic topology. The goal of this paper is to work out details of this observation. Our argument is based on a string topology chain model previously introduced by the author, and the theory of Kuranishi structures on moduli spaces of pseudo-holomorphic disks, which has been developed by Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono.;math.SG
1801.04634;Integration Order Replacement Technique for Iterated Ito Stochastic Integrals and Iterated Stochastic Integrals With Respect to Martingales;The article is devoted to the integration order replacement technique for iterated Ito stochastic integrals and iterated stochastic integrals with respect to martingales. We consider the class of iterated Ito stochastic integrals, for which with probability 1 the formulas of integration order replacement corresponding to the rules of classical integral calculus are reasonable. The theorems on integration order replacement for the class of iterated Ito stochastic integrals is proven. Many examples of this theorems usage have been considered. These results are generalized for the class of iterated stochastic integrals with respect to martingales.;math.PR
1801.04636;Phase Transitions on the Markov and Lagrange Dynamical Spectra;The Markov and Lagrange dynamical spectra, was introduced by Moreira and share several geometric and topological aspects with the classical ones. However, some features of generic dynamical spectra associated to hyperbolic sets can be proved in the dynamical case and we do not know if they are true in classical case. They can be a good source of natural conjectures about the classical spectra: it is natural to conjecture that some properties which hold for generic dynamical spectra associated to hyperbolic maps also holds for the classical Markov and Lagrange spectra. In this paper, we show that, for generic dynamical spectra associated to horseshoes, there is a transition point a in the spectra such that for any $\delta &gt, 0$, the intersection of the spectra with $(a-\delta, a)$ is a countable union of Cantor sets with Hausdorff dimension smaller than 1, while the intersection of the spectra with $(a, a + \delta)$ have non-empty interior. This is still open for the classical Markov and Lagrange spectra.;math.DS
1801.04638;Pointlike sets for varieties determined by groups;For a variety of finite groups $\mathbf H$, let $\overline{\mathbf H}$ denote the variety of finite semigroups all of whose subgroups lie in $\mathbf H$. We give a characterization of the subsets of a finite semigroup that are pointlike with respect to $\overline{\mathbf H}$. Our characterization is effective whenever $\mathbf H$ has a decidable membership problem. In particular, the separation problem for $\overline{\mathbf H}$-languages is decidable for any decidable variety of finite groups $\mathbf H$. This generalizes Henckell's theorem on decidability of aperiodic pointlikes.;math.GR
1801.04639;An Elementary Dyadic Riemann Hypothesis;The connection zeta function of a finite abstract simplicial complex G is defined as zeta_L(s)=sum_x 1/lambda_x^s, where lambda_x are the eigenvalues of the connection Laplacian L defined by L(x,y)=1 if x and y intersect and 0 else. (I) As a consequence of the spectral formula chi(G)=sum_x (-1)^dim(x) = p(G)-n(G), where p(G) is the number of positive eigenvalues and n(G) is the number of negative eigenvalues of L, both the Euler characteristic chi(G)=zeta(0)-2 i zeta'(0)/pi as well as determinant det(L)=e^zeta'(0)/pi can be written in terms of zeta. (II) As a consequence of the generalized Cauchy-Binet formula for the coefficients of the characteristic polynomials of a product of matrices we show that for every one-dimensional simplicial complex G, the functional equation zeta(s)=zeta(-s) holds, where zeta(s) is the Zeta function of the positive definite squared connection operator L^2 of G. Equivalently, the spectrum sigma of the integer matrix L^2 for a 1-dimensional complex always satisfies the symmetry sigma = 1/sigma and the characteristic polynomial of L^2 is palindromic. The functional equation extends to products of one-dimensional complexes. (III) Explicit expressions for the spectrum of circular connection Laplacian lead to an explicit entire zeta function in the Barycentric limit. The situation is simpler than in the Hodge Laplacian H=D^2 case where no functional equation was available. In the connection Laplacian case, the limiting zeta function is a generalized hypergeometric function which for an integer s is given by an elliptic integral over the real elliptic curve w^2=(1+z)(1-z)(z^2-4z-1), which has the analytic involutive symmetry (z,w) to (1/z,w/z^2).;math.CO
1801.04643;Generalized Lambert Series Identities and Applications in Rank Differences;In this article, we prove two identities of generalized Lambert series. By introducing what we call $\mathcal{S}$-series, we establish relationships between multiple generalized Lambert series and multiple infinite products. Compared with Chan's work, these new identities are useful in generating various formulas for generalized Lambert series with the same poles. Using these formulas, we study the 3-dissection properties of ranks for overpartitions modulo 6. In this case, $-1$ appears as a unit root, so that double poles occur. We also relate these ranks to the third order mock theta functions $\omega(q)$ and $\rho(q)$;math.CO
1801.04645;Renewal in Hawkes processes with self-excitation and inhibition;This paper investigates Hawkes processes on the positive real line exhibiting both self-excitation and inhibition. Each point of this point process impacts its future intensity by the addition of a signed reproduction function. The case of a nonnegative reproduction function corresponds to self-excitation, and has been widely investigated in the literature. In particular, there exists a cluster representation of the Hawkes process which allows to apply results known for Galton-Watson trees. In the present paper, we establish limit theorems for Hawkes process with signed reproduction functions by using renewal techniques. We notably prove exponential concentration inequalities, and thus extend results of Reynaud-Bouret and Roy (2007) which were proved for nonnegative reproduction functions using this cluster representation which is no longer valid in our case. An important step for this is to establish the existence of exponential moments for renewal times of M/G/infinity queues that appear naturally in our problem. These results have their own interest, independently of the original problem for the Hawkes processes.;math.PR
1801.04650;Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access For Cooperative Communications: Challenges, Opportunities, And Trends;Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising radio access technique for next-generation wireless networks. In this article, we investigate the NOMA-based cooperative relay network. We begin with an introduction of the existing relay-assisted NOMA systems by classifying them into three categories: uplink, downlink, and composite architectures. Then, we discuss their principles and key features, and provide a comprehensive comparison from the perspective of spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and total transmit power. A novel strategy termed hybrid power allocation is further discussed for the composite architecture, which can reduce the computational complexity and signaling overhead at the expense of marginal sum rate degradation. Finally, major challenges, opportunities, and future research trends for the design of NOMA-based cooperative relay systems with other techniques are also highlighted to provide insights for researchers in this field.;cs.IT
1801.04653;Dimension reduction for slow-fast, piecewise-smooth, continuous systems of ODEs;The limiting slow dynamics of slow-fast, piecewise-linear, continuous systems of ODEs occurs on critical manifolds that are piecewise-linear. At points of non-differentiability, such manifolds are not normally hyperbolic and so the fundamental results of geometric singular perturbation theory do not apply. In this paper it is shown that if the critical manifold is globally stable then the system is forward invariant in a neighbourhood of the critical manifold. It follows that in this neighbourhood the dynamics is given by a regular perturbation of the dynamics on the critical manifold and so dimension reduction can be achieved. If the attraction is instead non-global, additional dynamics involving canards may be generated. For boundary equilibrium bifurcations of piecewise-smooth, continuous systems, the results are used to establish a general methodology by which such bifurcations can be analysed. This approach is illustrated with a three-dimensional model of ocean circulation.;math.DS
1801.04658;Information Geometric Approach to Bayesian Lower Error Bounds;Information geometry describes a framework where probability densities can be viewed as differential geometry structures. This approach has shown that the geometry in the space of probability distributions that are parameterized by their covariance matrix is linked to the fundamentals concepts of estimation theory. In particular, prior work proposes a Riemannian metric - the distance between the parameterized probability distributions - that is equivalent to the Fisher Information Matrix, and helpful in obtaining the deterministic Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Recent work in this framework has led to establishing links with several practical applications. However, classical CRLB is useful only for unbiased estimators and inaccurately predicts the mean square error in low signal-to-noise (SNR) scenarios. In this paper, we propose a general Riemannian metric that, at once, is used to obtain both Bayesian CRLB and deterministic CRLB along with their vector parameter extensions. We also extend our results to the Barankin bound, thereby enhancing their applicability to low SNR situations.;cs.IT
1801.04659;The Circular Law for Random Matrices with Intra-row Dependence;We consider the problem of determining the limiting spectral distribution for random matrices whose row distributions are permitted to have limited dependence. We assume mild moment conditions and give an extension of the Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur theorem for this context. The main new feature here are geometric conditions on the distributions which allow us to extend the circular law to this setting.;math.PR
1801.04665;A nonlocal shallow-water model arising from the full water waves with the Coriolis effect;In the present study a mathematical model of long-crested water waves propagating mainly in one direction with the effect of Earth's rotation is derived by following the formal asymptotic procedures. Such a model equation is analogous to the Camassa-Holm approximation of the two-dimensional incompressible and irrotational Euler equations and has a formal bi-Hamiltonian structure. Its solution corresponding to physically relevant initial perturbations is more accurate on a much longer time scale. It is shown that the deviation of the free surface can be determined by the horizontal velocity at a certain depth in the second-order approximation. The effects of the Coriolis force caused by the Earth rotation and nonlocal higher nonlinearities on blow-up criteria and wave-breaking phenomena are also investigated. Our refined analysis is approached by applying the method of characteristics and conserved quantities to the Riccati-type differential inequality.;math.AP
1801.04666;On a shallow-water approximation to the Green-Naghdi equations with the Coriolis effect;We consider an asymptotic 1D (in space) rotation-Camassa-Holm (R-CH) model, which could be used to describe the propagation of long-crested shallow-water waves in the equatorial ocean regions with allowance for the weak Coriolis effect due to the Earth's rotation. This model equation has similar wave-breaking phenomena as the Camassa-Holm equation. It is analogous to the rotation-Green-Naghdi (R-GN) equations with the weak Earth's rotation effect, modeling the propagation of wave allowing large amplitude in shallow water. We provide here a rigorous justification showing that solutions of the R-GN equations tend to associated solution of the R-CH model equation in the Camassa-Holm regime with the small amplitude and the larger wavelength. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the R-GN model equations are locally well-posed in a Sobolev space by the refined energy estimates.;math.AP
1801.04668;The decoding failure probability of MDPC codes;Moderate Density Parity Check (MDPC) codes are defined here as codes which have a parity-check matrix whose row weight is $O(\sqrt{n})$ where $n$ is the length $n$ of the code. They can be decoded like LDPC codes but they decode much less errors than LDPC codes: the number of errors they can decode in this case is of order $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$. Despite this fact they have been proved very useful in cryptography for devising key exchange mechanisms. They have also been proposed in McEliece type cryptosystems. However in this case, the parameters that have been proposed in \cite{MTSB13} were broken in \cite{GJS16}. This attack exploits the fact that the decoding failure probability is non-negligible. We show here that this attack can be thwarted by choosing the parameters in a more conservative way. We first show that such codes can decode with a simple bit-flipping decoder any pattern of $O\left(\frac{\sqrt{n} \log \log n}{\log n}\right)$ errors. This avoids the previous attack at the cost of significantly increasing the key size of the scheme. We then show that under a very reasonable assumption the decoding failure probability decays almost exponentially with the codelength with just two iterations of bit-flipping. With an additional assumption it has even been proved that it decays exponentially with an unbounded number of iterations and we show that in this case the increase of the key size which is required for resisting to the attack of \cite{GJS16} is only moderate.;cs.IT
1801.04673;Partial geodesics on symmetric groups endowed with breakpoint distance;The notion of partial geodesic was introduced by Jamshidpey et al. in "Sets of medians in the non-geodesic pseudometric space of unsigned genomes with breakpoints", 2014. In this paper, we study the density of points on non-trivial partial geodesics between two permutations $\xi_1^{(n)}$ and $\xi_2^{(n)}$ chosen uniformly and independently at random from the symmetric group $S_n$, where $S_n$ is endowed with the breakpoint distance. For a permutation $\pi := \pi_1 \ ... \ \pi_n$, any unordered pair $\{\pi_i , \pi_{i+1}\}$, for $i=1, ..., n-1$, is called an adjacency of $\pi$. The set of all adjacencies of $\pi$ is denoted by $\mathcal{A}_\pi$. Denote by $id^{(n)}$ the identity permutation, and let $I_n$ be an arbitrary subset of $\mathcal A_{id^{(n)}}$. We classify the set of all adjacencies of a permutation $\pi \in S_n$ into four types, with respect to $I_n$. Then for a permutation $\xi^{(n)}$ chosen uniformly at random from $S_n$, we derive a convergence theorem for the normalized number (after dividing by $n$) of adjacencies of each type in $\xi^{(n)}$ with respect to $I_n$ (for some random or deterministic choices of $I_n$), as $n\rightarrow \infty$. We also see an application of this convergence theorem to find the appropriate choices of $I_n$. A geodesic point of $u$ and $v$ in a pseudometric space $(S,\rho)$ is a point $w$ of the space that $\rho(u,w)+\rho(w,v)=\rho(u,v)$. We find an upper bound for the number of permutations $x\in S_n$ for which there exists at least one non-trivial geodesic point between $id^{(n)}$ and $x$, far from both. This partially verifies the conjecture of Haghighi and Sankoff stated in "Medians seek the corners, and other conjectures", 2012, namely we prove that, with high probability, there is no breakpoint median of two permutations $\xi_1^{(n)}$ and $\xi_2^{(n)}$ chosen uniformly and independently at random from $S_n$, far from both of them.;math.CO
1801.04674;Approximation of Excessive Backlog Probabilities of Two Tandem Queues;Let $X$ be the constrained random walk on ${\mathbb Z}_+^2$ taking the steps $(1,0)$, $(-1,1)$ and $(0,-1)$ with probabilities $\lambda &lt, (\mu_1\neq \mu_2)$, in particular, $X$ is assumed stable. Let $\tau_n$ be the first time $X$ hits $\partial A_n = \{x:x(1)+x(2) = n \}$ For $x \in {\mathbb Z}_+^2, x(1) + x(2) &lt, n$, the probability $p_n(x)= P_x( \tau_n &lt, \tau_0)$ is a key performance measure for the queueing system represented by $X$. Let $Y$ be the constrained random walk on ${\mathbb Z} \times {\mathbb Z}_+$ with increments $(-1,0)$, $(1,1)$ and $(0,-1)$. Let $\tau$ be the first time that the components of $Y$ equal each other. We derive the following explicit formula for $P_y(\tau &lt, \infty)$: \[ P_y(\tau &lt, \infty) = W(y)= \rho_2^{y(1)-y(2)} + \frac{\mu_2 - \lambda}{\mu_2 - \mu_1} \rho_1^{ y(1)-y(2)} \rho_1^{y(2)} + \frac{\mu_2-\lambda}{\mu_1 -\mu_2} \rho_2^{y(1)-y(2)} \rho_1^{y(2)}, \] where, $\rho_i = \lambda/\mu_i$, $i=1,2$, $y \in {\mathbb Z}\times{ \mathbb Z}_+$, $y(1) &gt, y(2)$, and show that $W(n-x_n(1),x_n(2))$ approximates $p_n(x_n)$ with relative error {\em exponentially decaying} in $n$ for $x_n = \lfloor nx \rfloor$, $x \in {\mathbb R}_+^2$, $0 &lt, x(1) + x(2) &lt, 1$. The steps of our analysis: 1) with an affine transformation, move the origin $(0,0)$ to $(n,0)$ on $\partial A_n$, let $n\nearrow \infty$ to remove the constraint on the $x(2)$ axis, this step gives the limit {\em unstable} /{\em transient} constrained random walk $Y$ and reduces $P_{x}(\tau_n &lt, \tau_0)$ to $P_y(\tau &lt, \infty)$, 2) construct a basis of harmonic functions of $Y$ and use it to apply the superposition principle to compute $P_y(\tau &lt, \infty).$ The construction involves the use of conjugate points on a characteristic surface associated with the walk $X$. The proof that the relative error decays exponentially uses a sequence of subsolutions of a related HJB equation on a manifold.;math.PR
1801.04675;Efficient arithmetic regularity and removal lemmas for induced bipartite patterns;Let $G$ be an abelian group of bounded exponent and $A \subseteq G$. We show that if the collection of translates of $A$ has VC dimension at most $d$, then for every $\epsilon&gt,0$ there is a subgroup $H$ of $G$ of index at most $\epsilon^{-d-o(1)}$ such that one can add or delete at most $\epsilon|G|$ elements to/from $A$ to make it a union of $H$-cosets. <br />We also establish a removal lemma with polynomial bounds, with applications to property testing, for induced bipartite patterns in a finite abelian group with bounded exponent.;math.CO
1801.04682;Primes dividing invariants of CM Picard curves;We give a bound on the primes dividing the denominators of invariants of Picard curves of genus 3 with complex multiplication. Unlike earlier bounds in genus 2 and 3, our bound is based not on bad reduction of curves, but on a very explicit type of good reduction. This approach simultaneously yields a simplification of the proof, and much sharper bounds. In fact, unlike all previous bounds for genus 3, our bound is sharp enough for use in explicit constructions of Picard curves.;math.NT
1801.04683;The global Cauchy problem for compressible Euler equations with a nonlocal dissipation;This paper studies the global existence and uniqueness of strong solutions and its large-time behavior for the compressible isothermal Euler equations with a nonlocal dissipation. The system is rigorously derived from the kinetic Cucker-Smale flocking equation with strong local alignment forces and diffusions through the hydrodynamic limit based on the relative entropy argument. In a perturbation framework, we establish the global existence of a unique strong solution for the system under suitable smallness and regularity assumptions on the initial data. We also provide the large-time behavior of solutions showing the fluid density and the velocity converge to its averages exponentially fast as time goes to infinity.;math.AP
1801.04691;Asymptotic Correlation Structure of Discounted Incurred But Not Reported Claims under Fractional Poisson Arrival Process;This paper studies the joint moments of a compound discounted renewal process observed at different times with each arrival removed from the system after a random delay. This process can be used to describe the aggregate (discounted) Incurred But Not Reported claims in insurance and also the total number of customers in an infinite server queue. It is shown that the joint moments can be obtained recursively in terms of the renewal density, from which the covariance and correlation structures are derived. In particular, the fractional Poisson process defined via the renewal approach is also considered. Furthermore, the asymptotic behaviour of covariance and correlation coefficient of the aforementioned quantities is analyzed as the time horizon goes to infinity. Special attention is paid to the cases of exponential and Pareto delays.;math.PR
1801.04694;Incompressible inviscid resistive MHD surface waves in 2D;We consider the dynamics of a layer of an incompressible electrically conducting fluid interacting with the magnetic field in a two-dimensional horizontally periodic setting. The upper boundary is in contact with the atmosphere, and the lower boundary is a rigid flat bottom. We prove the global well-posedness of the inviscid and resistive problem with surface tension around a non-horizontal uniform magnetic field, moreover, the solution decays to the equilibrium almost exponentially. One of the key observations here is an induced damping structure for the fluid vorticity due to the resistivity and transversal magnetic field.;math.AP
1801.04696;Robust capacitated trees and networks with uniform demands;We are interested in the design of robust (or resilient) capacitated rooted Steiner networks in case of terminals with uniform demands. Formally, we are given a graph, capacity and cost functions on the edges, a root, a subset of nodes called terminals, and a bound k on the number of edge failures. We first study the problem where k = 1 and the network that we want to design must be a tree covering the root and the terminals: we give complexity results and propose models to optimize both the cost of the tree and the number of terminals disconnected from the root in the worst case of an edge failure, while respecting the capacity constraints on the edges. Second, we consider the problem of computing a minimum-cost survivable network, i.e., a network that covers the root and terminals even after the removal of any k edges, while still respecting the capacity constraints on the edges. We also consider the possibility of protecting a given number of edges. We propose three different formulations: a cut-set based formulation, a flow based one, and a bilevel one (with an attacker and a defender). We propose algorithms to solve each formulation and compare their efficiency.;math.OC
1801.04706;Inclusion-exclusion by ordering-free cancellation;Whitney's broken circuit theorem gives a graphical example to reduce the number of the terms in the sum of the inclusion-exclusion formula by a predicted cancellation. So far, the known cancellations for the formula strongly depend on the prescribed (linear or partial) ordering on the index set. We give a new cancellation method, which does not require any ordering on the index set. Our method extends all the `ordering-based' methods known in the literatures and in general reduces more terms. As examples, we use our method to improve some relevant results on graph polynomials.;math.CO
1801.04707;Preconditioning of a hybridized discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for the Stokes equations;We present optimal preconditioners for a recently introduced hybridized discontinuous Galerkin finite element discretization of the Stokes equations. Typical of hybridized discontinuous Galerkin methods, the method has degrees-of-freedom that can be eliminated locally (cell-wise), thereby significantly reducing the size of the global problem. Although the linear system becomes more complex to analyze after static condensation of these element degrees-of-freedom, the pressure Schur complement of the original and reduced problem are the same. Using this fact, we prove spectral equivalence of this Schur complement to two simple matrices, which is then used to formulate optimal preconditioners for the statically condensed problem. Numerical simulations in two and three spatial dimensions demonstrate the good performance of the proposed preconditioners.;math.NA
1801.04708;Sensitivity analysis for multiscale stochastic reaction networks using hybrid approximations;We consider the problem of estimating parameter sensitivities for stochastic models of multiscale reaction networks. These sensitivity values are important for model analysis, and, the methods that currently exist for sensitivity estimation mostly rely on simulations of the stochastic dynamics. This is problematic because these simulations become computationally infeasible for multiscale networks due to reactions firing at several different timescales. However it is often possible to exploit the multiscale property to derive a "model reduction" and approximate the dynamics as a Piecewise Deterministic Markov process (PDMP), which is a hybrid process consisting of both discrete and continuous components. The aim of this paper is to show that such PDMP approximations can be used to accurately and efficiently estimate the parameter sensitivity for the original multiscale stochastic model. We prove the convergence of the original sensitivity to the corresponding PDMP sensitivity, in the limit where the PDMP approximation becomes exact. Moreover we establish a representation of the PDMP parameter sensitivity that separates the contributions of discrete and continuous components in the dynamics, and allows one to efficiently estimate both contributions.;math.PR
1801.04711;A note on the zeros of the zeta-function of Riemann;It is shown explicitly how the sign of Hardy's function $Z(t)$ depends on the parity of the zero-counting function $N(T)$. Two existing definitions of this function are analyzed, and some related problems are discussed.;math.NT
1801.04713;Comparison of two notions of subharmonicity on non-archimedean curves;We show that a continuous function on the analytification of a smooth proper algebraic curve over a non-archimedean field is subharmonic in the sense of Thuillier if and only if it is psh, i.e. subharmonic in the sense of Chambert-Loir and Ducros. This equivalence implies that the property psh for continuous functions is stable under pullback with respect to morphisms of curves. Furthermore, we prove an analogue of the monotone regularization theorem on the analytification of the projective line and Mumford curves using this equivalence.;math.AG
1801.04717;A Note On the Exponential Diophantine Equation (a^n-1)(b^n-1)=x^2;In 2002, F. Luca and G. Walsh solved the Diophantine equation in the title for all pairs (a,b) such that 1&lt,a&lt,b&lt,101 with some exceptions. There are sixty nine exceptions. In this paper, we give some new results concerning the equation in the title. It is proved that the equation (a^n-1)(b^n-1)=x^2 has no solutions if a,b have opposite parity and n&gt,4 with 2|n. Also, we solved (a^n-1)(b^n-1)=x^2 for the pairs (a,b)=(2,50),(4,49),(12,45),(13,76),(20,77),(28,49), and (45,100). Lastly, we show that when b is even, the equation (a^n-1)(b^(2n)a^n-1)=x^2 has no solutions n,x.;math.NT
1801.04719;Parallel weight 2 points on Hilbert modular eigenvarieties and the parity conjecture;Let F be a totally real field of degree d and let p be an odd prime which is totally split in F. We define and study one-dimensional partial eigenvarieties interpolating Hilbert modular forms over F with weight varying only at a single place v above p. For these eigenvarieties, we show that methods developed by Liu, Wan and Xiao apply and deduce that, over a boundary annulus in weight space of sufficiently small radius, the partial eigenvarieties decompose as a disjoint union of components which are finite over weight space. We apply this result to prove the parity version of the Bloch--Kato conjecture for finite slope Hilbert modular forms with trivial central character (under some assumptions), by reducing to the case of parallel weight 2. As another consequence of our results on partial eigenvarieties, we show, still under the assumption that p is totally split in F, that the full (dimension 1 + d) cuspidal Hilbert modular eigenvariety has the property that many (all, if d is even) irreducible components contain a classical point with non-critical slopes and parallel weight 2 (with some character at p whose conductor can be explicitly bounded), or any other algebraic weight.;math.NT
1801.04735;Secure Adaptive Group Testing;Group Testing (GT) addresses the problem of identifying a small subset of defective items from a large population, by grouping items into as few test pools as possible. In Adaptive GT (AGT), outcomes of previous tests can influence the makeup of future tests. This scenario has been studied from an information theoretic point of view. Aldridge $2012$ showed that in the regime of a few defectives, adaptivity does not help much, as the number of tests required for identification of the set of defectives is essentially the same as for non-adaptive GT. <br />Secure GT considers a scenario where there is an eavesdropper who may observe a fraction $\delta$ of the outcomes, and should not be able to infer the status of the items. In the non-adaptive scenario, the number of tests required is $1/(1-\delta)$ times the number of tests without the secrecy constraint. <br />In this paper, we consider Secure Adaptive GT. Specifically, when an adaptive algorithm has access to a private feedback link of rate $R_f$, we prove that the number of tests required for both correct reconstruction at the legitimate user, with high probability, and negligible mutual information at the eavesdropper is $1/min\{1,1-\delta+R_f\}$ times the number of tests required with no secrecy constraint. Thus, unlike non-secure GT, where an adaptive algorithm has only a mild impact, under a security constraint it can significantly boost performance. A key insight is that not only the adaptive link should disregard test results and send keys, these keys should be enhanced through a "secret sharing" scheme before usage.;cs.IT
1801.04738;Tilting modules over Auslander-Gorenstein Algebras;For a finite dimensional algebra $\Lambda$ and a non-negative integer $n$, we characterize when the set $\tilt_n\Lambda$ of additive equivalence classes of tilting modules with projective dimension at most $n$ has a minimal (or equivalently, minimum) element. This generalize results of Happel-Unger. Moreover, for an $n$-Gorenstein algebra $\Lambda$ with $n\geq 1$, we construct a minimal element in $\tilt_{n}\Lambda$. <br />As a result, we give equivalent conditions for a $k$-Gorenstein algebra to be Iwanaga-Gorenstein. Moreover, for an $1$-Gorenstein algebra $\Lambda$ and its factor algebra $\Gamma=\Lambda/(e)$, we show that there is a bijection between $\tilt_1\Lambda$ and the set $\sttilt\Gamma$ of isomorphism classes of basic support $\tau$-tilting $\Gamma$-modules, where $e$ is an idempotent such that $e\Lambda $ is the additive generator of projective-injective $\Lambda$-modules.;math.RT
1801.04740;Interior and boundary gradient estimates for Neumann problem of fully nonlinear Hessian equations;In this paper we study the {\it a priori} gradient estimates for admissible solutions to Neumann boundary value problem of fully nonlinear Hessian equations on Riemannian manifolds.

1801.04742;Hilbert&#x27,s Error?;It is well known that a center of a given circle cannot be constructed using only a straightedge and that this was proven by David Hilbert. Still it is not so clear what kind of object is proven to be non-existing. We analyze different attempts to define a geometric construction appearing in the literature and observe that none of them is really satisfactory and that Hilbert's proof needs to be corrected (as noted by Akopyan and Fedorov);math.HO
1801.04746;A frequency approach for stabilization of one-dimensional degenerate wave equation;In this paper, we are concerned with the study of stabilization problem for the following strongly degenerate wave equation in one space dimension $$w_{tt}(x,t)-\left(x^\alpha w_x(x,t)\right)_x=0$$ where ${\bf\alpha\in [1,2)}$. Thus, using a frequency domain method inspired from \cite{BT}, we prove the polynomial decays of its total energy with $t^{-\nicefrac{1}{2}}$ decay rate.;math.AP
1801.04748;Directed Strongly Regular Cayley Graphs on Dihedral groups;In this paper,we construct some directed strongly regular Cayley graphs on dihedral groups,these generalizes some earlier constructions.We also characterize some certain directed strongly regular Cayley graphs on dihedral groups $D_{p^\alpha}$,where $p$ is a prime and $\alpha\geqslant 1$ is a positive integer.;math.CO
1801.04750;The visual boundary of hyperbolic free-by-cyclic groups;Let $\phi$ be an atoroidal outer automorphism of the free group $F_n$. We study the Gromov boundary of the hyperbolic group $G_{\phi} = F_n \rtimes_{\phi} \mathbb{Z}$. We explicitly describe a family of embeddings of the complete bipartite graph $K_{3,3}$ into $\partial G_\phi$. To do so, we define the directional Whitehead graph and prove that an indecomposable $F_n$-tree is Levitt type if and only if one of its directional Whitehead graphs contains more than one edge. As an application, we obtain a direct proof of Kapovich-Kleiner's theorem that $\partial G_\phi$ is homeomorphic to the Menger curve if the automorphism is atoroidal and fully irreducible.;math.GT
1801.04757;On the Distribution of Random Geometric Graphs;Random geometric graphs (RGGs) are commonly used to model networked systems that depend on the underlying spatial embedding. We concern ourselves with the probability distribution of an RGG, which is crucial for studying its random topology, properties (e.g., connectedness), or Shannon entropy as a measure of the graph's topological uncertainty (or information content). Moreover, the distribution is also relevant for determining average network performance or designing protocols. However, a major impediment in deducing the graph distribution is that it requires the joint probability distribution of the $n(n-1)/2$ distances between $n$ nodes randomly distributed in a bounded domain. As no such result exists in the literature, we make progress by obtaining the joint distribution of the distances between three nodes confined in a disk in $\mathbb{R}^2$. This enables the calculation of the probability distribution and entropy of a three-node graph. For arbitrary $n$, we derive a series of upper bounds on the graph entropy, in particular, the bound involving the entropy of a three-node graph is tighter than the existing bound which assumes distances are independent. Finally, we provide numerical results on graph connectedness and the tightness of the derived entropy bounds.;cs.IT
1801.04759;Hessian-information geometric formulation of Hamiltonian systems and generalized Toda&#x27,s dual transform;In this paper a class of classical Hamiltonian systems is geometrically formulated. This class is such that a Hamiltonian can be written as the sum of a kinetic energy function and a potential energy function. In addition, these energy functions are assumed strictly convex. For this class of Hamiltonian systems Hessian and information geometric formulation is given. With this formulation, a generalized Toda's dual transform is proposed, where his original transform was used in deriving his integrable lattice system. Then a relation between the generalized Toda's dual transform and the Legendre transform of a class of potential energy functions is shown. As an extension of this formulation, dissipation-less electric circuit models are also discussed in the geometric viewpoint above.;math-ph
1801.04761;A Tight Converse to the Spectral Resolution Limit via Convex Programming;It is now well understood that convex programming can be used to estimate the frequency components of a spectrally sparse signal from $2m+1$ uniform temporal measurements. It is conjectured that a phase transition on the success of the total-variation regularization occurs when the distance between the spectral components of the signal to estimate crosses $1/m$. We prove the necessity part of this conjecture by demonstrating that this regularization can fail whenever the spectral distance of the signal of interest is asymptotically equal to $1/m$.;cs.IT
1801.04765;Recent results on the Kobayashi and Green-Griffiths-Lang conjectures;The study of entire holomorphic curves contained in projective algebraic varieties is intimately related to fascinating questions of geometry and number theory -- especially through the concepts of curvature and positivity which are central themes in Kodaira's contributions to mathematics. The aim of these lectures is to present recent results concerning the geometric side of the problem. The Green-Griffiths-Lang conjecture stipulates that for every projective variety $X$ of general type over~${\mathbb C}$, there exists a proper algebraic subvariety $Y$ of $X$ containing all non constant entire curves $f:{\mathbb C}\to X$. Using the formalism of directed varieties and jet bundles, we show that this assertion holds true in case $X$ satisfies a strong general type condition that is related to a certain jet-semistability property of the tangent bundle $T\_X$. It is possible to exploit similar techniques to investigate a famous conjecture of Shoshichi Kobayashi (1970), according to which a generic algebraic hypersurface of dimension $n$ and of sufficiently large degree $d\ge d\_n$ in the complex projective space $\bP^{n+1}$ is hyperbolic: in the early 2000's, Yum-Tong Siu proposed a strategy that led in 2015 to a proof based on a clever use of slanted vector fields on jet spaces, combined with Nevanlinna theory arguments. In 2016, the conjecture has been settled in a different way by Damian Brotbek, making a more direct use of Wronskian differential operators and associated multiplier ideals, shortly afterwards, Ya Deng showed how the proof could be modified to yield an explicit value of $d\_n$. We give here a short proof based on a drastic simplification of their ideas, along with a further improvement of Deng's bound, namely $d\_n=\lfloor\frac{1}{5}(en)^{2n+2}\rfloor$.;math.AG
1801.04766;A Markov theorem for generalized plat decomposition;We prove a Markov theorem for tame links in a connected closed orientable 3-manifold $M$ with respect to a plat-like representation. More precisely, given a genus $g$ Heegaard surface $\Sigma_g$ for $M$ we represent each link in $M$ as the plat closure of a braid in the surface braid group $B_{g,2n}=\pi_1(C_{2n}(\Sigma_g))$ and analyze how to translate the equivalence of links in $M$ under ambient isotopy into an algebraic equivalence in $B_{g,2n}$. First, we study the equivalence problem in $\Sigma_g\times [0,1]$, and then, to obtain the equivalence in $M$, we investigate how isotopies corresponding to "sliding" along meridian discs change the braid representative. At the end we provide explicit constructions for Heegaard genus 1 manifolds, i.e. lens spaces and $S^2\times S^1$.;math.GT
1801.04767;The k-almost Ricci solitons and contact geometry;The aim of this article is to study the k-almost Ricci soliton and k-almost gradient Ricci soliton on contact metric manifold. First, we prove that if a compact K-contact metric is a k-almost gradient Ricci soliton then it is isometric to a unit sphere S2n+1. Next, we extend this result on a compact k-almost Ricci soliton when the flow vector field X is contact. Finally, we study some special types of k-almost Ricci soliton where the potential vector field X is point wise collinear with the Reeb vector field {\xi} of the contact metric structure.;math.DG
1801.04769;Nonlocal Representation of the $sl(2,R)$ Algebra for the Chazy equation;A demonstration of how the point symmetries of the Chazy Equation become nonlocal symmetries for the reduced equation is discussed. Moreover we construct an equivalent third-order differential equation which is related to the Chazy Equation under a generalized transformation, and find the point symmetries of the Chazy Equation are generalized symmetries for the new equation. With the use of singularity analysis and a simple coordinate transformation we construct a solution for the Chazy Equation which is given by a Right Painlev\'e Series. The singularity analysis is applied to the new third-order equation and we find that it admits two solutions, one given by a Left Painlev\'e Series and one given by a Right Painlev\'e Series where the leading-order behaviors and the resonances are explicitly those of the Chazy Equation.;math.CA
1801.04770;On the Exponential Diophantine Equation $(a^2-2)(b^2-2)=x^2$;In this paper, we consider the equation $(a^n-2^{m})(b^n-2^{m})=x^2$. By assuming the abc conjecture is true, in [8], Luca and Walsh gave a theorem, which implies that the above equation has only finitely many solutions $n,x$ if a and b are different fixed positive integers. We solve the above equation when $m=1$ and $(a,b)=(2,10),(4,100),(10,58),(3,45)$. Moreover, we show that $(a^2-2)(b^2-2)=x^2$ has no solution n,x if 2|n and gcd$(a,b)=1$. We also give a conjecture which says that the equation $(2^2-2)((2P_k)^n-2)=x^2$ has only the solution $(n,x)=(2,Q_k)$, where $k&gt,3$ is odd and $P_k,Q_k$ are Pell and Pell Lucas numbers, respectively. We also conjecture that if the equation $(a^2-2)(b^2-2)=x^2$ has a solution $n,x$, then $n&lt,7$, where $2&lt,a&lt,b$.;math.NT
1801.04773;Mergelyan&#x27,s and Arakelian&#x27,s theorems for manifold-valued maps;In this paper we show that Mergelyan's theorem holds for maps from open Riemann surfaces to Oka manifolds. This is used to prove the analogue of Arakelian's theorem on uniform approximation of holomorphic maps from closed subsets of the plane $\mathbb C$ to any compact complex homogeneous manifold.;math.CV
1801.04775;Two High-performance Schemes of Transmit Antenna Selection for Secure Spatial Modulation;In this paper, a secure spatial modulation (SM) system with artificial noise (AN)-aided is investigated. To achieve higher secrecy rate (SR) in such a system, two high-performance schemes of transmit antenna selection (TAS), leakage-based and maximum secrecy rate (Max-SR), are proposed and a generalized Euclidean distance-optimized antenna selection (EDAS) method is designed. From simulation results and analysis, the four TAS schemes have an decreasing order: Max-SR, leakage-based, generalized EDAS, and random (conventional), in terms of SR performance. However, the proposed Max-SR method requires the exhaustive search to achieve the optimal SR performance, thus its complexity is extremely high as the number of antennas tends to medium and large scale. The proposed leakage-based method approaches the Max-SR method with much lower complexity. Thus, it achieves a good balance between complexity and SR performance. In terms of bit error rate (BER), their performances are in an increasing order: random, leakage-based, Max-SR, and generalized EDAS.;cs.IT
1801.04776;The adic tame site;For every adic space $Z$ we construct a site $Z_t$, the tame site of $Z$. For a scheme $X$ over a base scheme $S$ we obtain a tame site by associating with $X/S$ an adic space $\textit{Spa}(X,S)$ and considering the tame site $\textit{Spa}(X,S)_t$. We examine the connection of the cohomology of the tame site with \'etale cohomology and compare its fundamental group with the conventional tame fundamental group. Finally, assuming resolution of singularities, for a regular scheme $X$ over a base scheme $S$ of characteristic $p &gt, 0$ we prove a cohomological purity theorem for the constant sheaf $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ on $\textit{Spa}(X,S)_t$. As a corollary we obtain homotopy invariance for the tame cohomology groups of $\textit{Spa}(X,S)$.;math.AG
1801.04782;Block-coordinate primal-dual method for the nonsmooth minimization over linear constraints;We consider the problem of minimizing a convex, separable, nonsmooth function subject to linear constraints. The numerical method we propose is a block-coordinate extension of the Chambolle-Pock primal-dual algorithm. We prove convergence of the method without resorting to assumptions like smoothness or strong convexity of the objective, full-rank condition on the matrix, strong duality or even consistency of the linear system. Freedom from imposing the latter assumption permits convergence guarantees for misspecified or noisy systems.;math.OC
1801.04783;Subpolynomial trace reconstruction for random strings and arbitrary deletion probability;The insertion-deletion channel takes as input a bit string ${\bf x}\in\{0,1\}^{n}$, and outputs a string where bits have been deleted and inserted independently at random. The trace reconstruction problem is to recover $\bf x$ from many independent outputs (called "traces") of the insertion-deletion channel applied to $\bf x$. We show that if $\bf x$ is chosen uniformly at random, then $\exp(O(\log^{1/3} n))$ traces suffice to reconstruct $\bf x$ with high probability. For the deletion channel with deletion probability $q &lt, 1/2$ the earlier upper bound was $\exp(O(\log^{1/2} n))$. The case of $q\geq 1/2$ or the case where insertions are allowed has not been previously analyzed, and therefore the earlier upper bound was as for worst-case strings, i.e., $\exp(O( n^{1/3}))$. We also show that our reconstruction algorithm runs in $n^{1+o(1)}$ time. <br />A key ingredient in our proof is a delicate two-step alignment procedure where we estimate the location in each trace corresponding to a given bit of $\bf x$. The alignment is done by viewing the strings as random walks and comparing the increments in the walk associated with the input string and the trace, respectively.;math.PR
1801.04784;Triviality properties of principal bundles on singular curves-II;For $G$ a split semi-simple group scheme and $P$ a principal $G$-bundle on a relative curve $X\to S$, we study a natural obstruction for the triviality of $P$ on the complement of a relatively ample Cartier divisor $D \subset X$. We show, by constructing explicit examples, that the obstruction is nontrivial if $G$ is not simply connected but it can be made to vanish, if $S$ is the spectrum of a dvr (and some other hypotheses), by a faithfully flat base change. The vanishing of this obstruction is shown to be a sufficient condition for etale local triviality if $S$ is a smooth curve, and the singular locus of $X-D$ is finite over $S$.;math.AG
1801.04790;A new relationship between the dilatation of pseudo-Anosov braids and fixed point theory;A relation between the dilatation of pseudo-Anosov braids and fixed point theory was studied by Ivanov. In this paper we reveal a new relationship between the above two subjects by showing a formula for the dilatation of pseudo-Anosov braids by means of the representations of braid groups due to B. Jiang and H. Zheng.;math.GT
1801.04791;Stability of transonic jets with strong rarefaction waves for two-dimensional steady compressible Euler system;We study supersonic flow past a convex corner which is surrounded by quiescent gas. When the pressure of the upstream supersonic flow is larger than that of the quiescent gas, there appears a strong rarefaction wave to rarefy the supersonic gas. Meanwhile, a transonic characteristic discontinuity appears to separate the supersonic flow behind the rarefaction wave from the static gas. In this paper, we employ a wave front tracking method to establish structural stability of such a flow pattern under non-smooth perturbations of the upcoming supersonic flow. It is an initial-value/free-boundary problem for the two-dimensional steady non-isentropic compressible Euler system. The main ingredients are careful analysis of wave interactions and construction of suitable Glimm functional, to overcome the difficulty that the strong rarefaction wave has a large total variation.;math.AP
1801.04793;A note for the global non-existence of semirelativistic equations with non-gauge invariant power type nonlinearity;The non-existence of global solutions for semirelativistic equations with non-gauge invariant power type nonlinearity is revisited by a relatively direct way with a pointwise estimate of fractional derivative of some test functions.;math.AP
1801.04797;A Simplicial Approach to Stratified Homotopy Theory;In this article we consider the homotopy theory of stratified spaces through a simplicial point of view. We first consider a model category of filtered simplicial sets over some fixed poset $P$, and show that it is a simplicial combinatorial model category. We then define a generalization of the homotopy groups for any fibrant filtered simplicial set $X$ : the filtered homotopy groups $s\pi_n(X)$. They are diagrams of groups built from the homotopy groups of the different pieces of $X$. We then show that the weak equivalences are exactly the morphisms that induce isomorphisms on those filtered homotopy groups. <br />Then, using filtered versions of the topological realisation of a simplicial set and of the simplicial set of singular simplices, we transfer those results to a category whose objects are topological spaces stratified over $P$. In particular, we get a stratified version of Whitehead's theorem. Specializing to the case of conically stratified spaces, a wide class of topological stratified spaces, we recover a theorem of Miller saying that to understand the homotopy type of conically stratified spaces, one only has to understand the homotopy type of strata and holinks. We then provide a family of examples of conically stratified spaces and of computations of their filtered homotopy groups.;math.AT
1801.04799;Derivation of the time dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation for a class of non purely positive potentials;We present a microscopic derivation of the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation starting from an interacting N-particle system of Bosons. We prove convergence of the reduced density matrix corresponding to the exact time evolution to the projector onto the solution of the respective Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Our work extends a previous result by one of us (P.P.[44]) to interaction potentials which need not to be nonnegative, but may have a sufficiently small negative part. One key estimate in our proof is an operator inequality which was first proven by Jun Yin, see [49].;math-ph

1801.04809;A partial order on Motzkin paths;The Tamari lattice, defined on Catalan objects such as binary trees and Dyck paths, is a well-studied poset in combinatorics. It is thus natural to try to extend it to other families of lattice paths. In this article, we fathom such a possibility by defining and studying an analogy of the Tamari lattice on Motzkin paths. While our generalization is not a lattice, each of its connected components is isomorphic to an interval in the classical Tamari lattice. With this structural result, we proceed to the enumeration of components and intervals in the poset of Motzkin paths we defined. We also extend the structural and enumerative results to Schr\"oder paths. We conclude by a discussion on the relation between our work and that of Baril and Pallo (2014).;math.CO
1801.04814;Well-posedness for scalar conservation laws with moving flux constraints;We consider a strongly coupled ODE-PDE system representing moving bottlenecks immersed in vehicular traffic. The PDE consists of a scalar conservation law modeling the traffic flow evolution and the ODE models the trajectory of a slow moving vehicle. The moving bottleneck influences the bulk traffic flow via a point flux constraint, which is given by an inequality on the flux at the slow vehicle position. We prove uniqueness and continuous dependence of solutions with respect to initial data of bounded variation. The proof is based on a new backward in time method established to capture the values of the norm of generalized tangent vectors at every time.;math.AP
1801.04817;Distributions and Euler systems for the general linear group;The main aim is to give a rigorous statement and proof of the slogan "the d-fold tensor product of distributions is an Euler system for GL_d". Of the few known examples of Euler systems, we look at those of cyclotomic units and of Beilinson-Kato elements. The cyclotomic units satisfy distribution property, and this is the key to the proof of the norm relation property for GL_1. For the Beilinson-Kato elements, the Siegel units satisfy distribution property, and the 2-fold tensor product, giving rise to elements in the K_2 of modular curves, satisfies the norm relation for GL_2. We make this common property clear, generalizing everything to GL_d. <br />As an application (our main arithmetic result), we construct elements in the motivic cohomology of Drinfeld modular schemes with integral coefficient and show that the norm relation common to Euler systems (i.e., the norm of one element is described using the local L-factor times another element) hold. This improves the older result which was done for Drinfeld modular varieties (over the function field as opposed to the ring of integers) and with coefficients in the rationals. <br />We use the language of Y-sites (<a href="/abs/1506.08023">arXiv:1506.08023</a>) which is introduced in order to simplify the computation common to the theory of automorphic forms. Instead of double cosets, we work more systematically with torsion modules and Q-morphisms between them. The idea is that torsion modules are level structures, and Q-morphisms induce morphisms between some moduli spaces. Chapters 1 and 3 serve as a sequel: further generalities on Y-sites, more examples of Y-sites, and proofs of some statements in loc.cit are given. An application is also given: we provide a group theoretic formulation of a conjecture of Tamagawa on affine curves over an algebraic closure of a finite field.;math.NT
1801.04820;$S$-almost perfect commutative rings;Given a multiplicative subset $S$ in a commutative ring $R$, we consider $S$-weakly cotorsion and $S$-strongly flat $R$-modules, and show that all $R$-modules have $S$-strongly flat covers if and only if all flat $R$-modules are $S$-strongly flat. These equivalent conditions hold if and only if the localization $R_S$ is a perfect ring and, for every element $s\in S$, the quotient ring $R/sR$ is a perfect ring, too. The multiplicative subset $S\subset R$ is allowed to contain zero-divisors.;math.AC
1801.04827;Notes on the Frobenius test exponents;In this paper we show that the Frobenius test exponent for parameter ideals of a local ring of prime characteristic is always bigger than or equal to its Hartshorne-Speiser-Lyubeznik number. Our argument is based on an isomorphism of Nagel and Schenzel on local cohomology that we will provide an elementary proof.;math.AC
1801.04836;The number of representations by a ternary sum of triangular numbers;For positive integers $a,b,c$, and an integer $n$, the number of integer solutions $(x,y,z) \in \mathbb Z^3$ of $a \frac{x(x-1)}{2} + b \frac{y(y-1)}{2} + c \frac{z(z-1)}{2} = n$ is denoted by $t(a,b,c,n)$. In this article, we prove some relations between $t(a,b,c,n)$ and the numbers of representations of integers by some ternary quadratic forms. In particular, we prove various conjectures given by Z. H. Sun in \cite{s}.;math.NT
1801.04840;Pressure Reconstruction for Weak Solutions of the Two-Phase Incompressible Navier--Stokes Equations with Surface Tension;For the two-phase incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with surface tension, we derive an appropriate weak formulation incorporating a variational formulation using divergence-free test functions. We prove a consistency result to justify our definition and, under reasonable regularity assumptions, we reconstruct the pressure function from the weak formulation.;math.AP
1801.04843;Relation between the Resonance and the Scattering Matrix in the massless Spin-Boson Model;We establish the precise relation between the integral kernel of the scattering matrix and the resonance in the massless Spin-Boson model which describes the interaction of a two-level quantum system with a second-quantized scalar field. For this purpose, we derive an explicit formula for the two-body scattering matrix. We impose an ultraviolet cut-off and assume a slightly less singular behavior of the boson form factor of the relativistic scalar field but no infrared cut-off. The purpose of this work is to bring together scattering and resonance theory and arrive at a similar result as provided by Simon in [38], where it was shown that the singularities of the meromorphic continuation of the integral kernel of the scattering matrix are located precisely at the resonance energies. The corresponding problem has been open in quantum field theory ever since. To the best of our knowledge, the presented formula provides the first rigorous connection between resonance and scattering theory in the sense of [38] in a model of quantum field theory.;math-ph
1801.04844;Quantization of Noncompact Coverings and Strong Morita Equivalence;Any finite algebraic Galois covering corresponds to an algebraic Morita equivalence. Here the $C^*$-algebraic analog of this fact is proven, i.e. any noncommutative finite-fold covering corresponds to a strong Morita equivalence.;math.OA
1801.04845;GIT versus Baily-Borel compactification for $K3$&#x27,s which are double covers of $\mathbb P^1\times\mathbb P^1$;In previous work, we have introduced a program aimed at studying the birational geometry of locally symmetric varieties of Type IV associated to moduli of certain projective varieties of K3 type. In particular, a concrete goal of our program is to understand the relationship between GIT and Baily-Borel compactifications for quartic K3 surfaces, K3's which are double covers of a smooth quadric surface, and double EPW sextics. In our first paper (<a href="/abs/1607.01324">arXiv:1607.01324</a>), based on arithmetic considerations, we have given conjectural decompositions into simple birational transformations of the period maps from the GIT moduli spaces mentioned above to the corresponding Baily-Borel compactifications. In our second paper (<a href="/abs/1612.07432">arXiv:1612.07432</a>) we studied the case of quartic K3's, we have given geometric meaning to this decomposition and we have partially verified our conjectures. Here, we give a full proof of our conjectures for the moduli space of K3's which are double covers of a smooth quadric surface. The main new tool here is VGIT for (2,4) complete intersection curves.;math.AG
1801.04848;Empirical $L^2$-distance test statistics for ergodic diffusions;The aim of this paper is to introduce a new type of test statistic for simple null hypothesis on one-dimensional ergodic diffusion processes sampled at discrete times. We deal with a quasi-likelihood approach for stochastic differential equations (i.e. local gaussian approximation of the transition functions) and define a test statistic by means of the empirical $L^2$-distance between quasi-likelihoods. We prove that the introduced test statistic is asymptotically distribution free, namely it weakly converges to a $\chi^2$ random variable. Furthermore, we study the power under local alternatives of the parametric test. We show by the Monte Carlo analysis that, in the small sample case, the introduced test seems to perform better than other tests proposed in literature.;math.PR
1801.04852;Border rank is not multiplicative under the tensor product;It has recently been shown that the tensor rank can be strictly submultiplicative under the tensor product, where the tensor product of two tensors is a tensor whose order is the sum of the orders of the two factors. The necessary upper bounds were obtained with help of border rank. It was left open whether border rank itself can be strictly submultiplicative. We answer this question in the affirmative. In order to do so, we construct lines in projective space along which the border rank drops multiple times and use this result in conjunction with a previous construction for a tensor rank drop. Our results also imply strict submultiplicativity for cactus rank and border cactus rank.;math.AG
1801.04853;System-Aware Compression;Many information systems employ lossy compression as a crucial intermediate stage among other processing components. While the important distortion is defined by the system's input and output signals, the compression usually ignores the system structure, therefore, leading to an overall sub-optimal rate-distortion performance. In this paper we propose a compression methodology for an operational rate-distortion optimization considering a known system layout, modeled using linear operators and noise. Using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) technique, we show that the design of the new globally-optimized compression reduces to a standard compression of a "system adjusted" signal. Essentially, the proposed framework leverages standard compression techniques to address practical settings of the noisy source coding problem. We further explain the main ideas of our method by theoretically studying the case of a cyclo-stationary Gaussian signal. We present experimental results for coding of one-dimensional signals and for video compression using the HEVC standard, showing significant gains by the adjustment to an acquisition-rendering system.;cs.IT
1801.04862;On matrix-valued log-concavity and related Prekopa and Brascamp-Lieb inequalities;We propose a new, self-contained, approach to H. Raufi's extension of Prekopa's theorem for matrix-valued log-concave functions. Along the way, new related inequalities are established, in particular a Brascamp-Lieb variance inequality for matrix weights.;math.FA
1801.04866;An inverse problem for the relativistic Schr&#xf6,dinger equation with partial boundary data;We study the inverse problem of determining the vector and scalar potentials $\mathcal{A}(t,x)=\left(A_{0},A_{1},\cdots,A_{n}\right)$ and $q(t,x)$, respectively, in the relativistic Schr\"odinger equation <br />\begin{equation*} <br />\Big{(}\left(\partial_{t}+A_{0}(t,x)\right)^{2}-\sum_{j=1}^{n}\left(\partial_{j}+A_{j}(t,x)\right)^{2}+q(t,x)\Big{)}u(t,x)=0 <br />\end{equation*} <br />in the region $Q=(0,T)\times\Omega$, where $\Omega$ is a $C^{2}$ bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n\geq 3$ and $T&gt,\mbox{diam}(\Omega)$ from partial data on the boundary $\partial Q$. We prove the unique determination of these potentials modulo a natural gauge invariance for the vector field term.;math.AP
1801.04867;Hierarchically hyperbolic groups are determined by their Morse boundaries;We generalize a result of Paulin on the Gromov boundary of hyperbolic groups to the Morse boundary of proper, maximal hierarchically hyperbolic spaces admitting cocompact group actions by isometries. Namely we show that if the Morse boundaries of two such spaces each contain at least three points, then the spaces are quasi-isometric if and only if there exists a 2-stable, quasi-m\"obius homeomorphism between their Morse boundaries. Our result extends a recent result of Charney-Murray, who prove such a classification for CAT(0) groups, and is new for mapping class groups and the fundamental groups of $3$-manifolds without Nil or Sol components.;math.GT
1801.04873;Randomized projection methods for convex feasibility problems: conditioning and convergence rates;Finding a point in the intersection of a collection of closed convex sets, that is the convex feasibility problem, represents the main modeling strategy for many computational problems. In this paper we analyze new stochastic reformulations of the convex feasibility problem in order to facilitate the development of new algorithmic schemes. We also analyze the conditioning problem parameters using certain (linear) regularity assumptions on the individual convex sets. Then, we introduce a general random projection algorithmic framework, which extends to the random settings many existing projection schemes, designed for the general convex feasibility problem. Our general random projection algorithm allows to project simultaneously on several sets, thus providing great flexibility in matching the implementation of the algorithm on the parallel architecture at hand. Based on the conditioning parameters, besides the asymptotic convergence results, we also derive explicit sublinear and linear convergence rates for this general algorithmic framework.;math.OC
1801.04882;Coding over Sets for DNA Storage;In this paper, we study error-correcting codes for the storage of data in synthetic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). We investigate a storage model where data is represented by an unordered set of $M$ sequences, each of length $L$. Errors within that model are losses of whole sequences and point errors inside the sequences, such as substitutions, insertions and deletions. We propose code constructions which can correct these errors with efficient encoders and decoders. By deriving upper bounds on the cardinalities of these codes using sphere packing arguments, we show that many of our codes are close to optimal.;cs.IT
1801.04884;Chern Simons invariants in $KK$ theory;For a unitary representation $\phi$ of the fundamental group of a compact smooth manifold, Atiyah, Patodi, Singer defined the so called $\alpha$-invariant of $\phi$ using the Chern-Simons invariants. In this article using traces on $C^*$-algebras, we give an intrinsically(i.e without using Chern character) define an element in $KK$ with real coefficients theory whose pullback by the representation $\phi$ is the $\alpha$-invariant.;math.KT
1801.04888;Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for Mobile VLC Networks with Random Receiver Orientation;We consider a downlink multiuser visible light communications (VLC) network where users randomly change their location and vertical orientation. The non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) strategy is adopted to serve multiple users simultaneously, and, hence, to improve spectral efficiency. We propose two novel user scheduling schemes for NOMA, which are referred to as individual and group-based. In order to further reduce the computational complexity and link overhead, novel limited-feedback schemes (on channel quality) are also proposed, which basically involve mean vertical angle (instead of its instantaneous value). Moreover, a two-bit feedback scheme is proposed for group-based user scheduling, which relies on not only distance but also vertical angle (in contrast to conventional one-bit feedback with distance only). The outage probability and sum-rate expressions are derived analytically, which show a very good match with the simulation data. Numerical results verify that the practical feedback scheme with the mean vertical angle achieves a near-optimal sum-rate performance, and the two-bit feedback significantly outperforms the one-bit feedback.;cs.IT
1801.04889;On non-amenable embeddable spaces in relation with free products;In this paper we give sufficient conditions for a free product of residually finite groups to admit an embeddable box space. This generalizes the constructions of Arzhantseva, Guentner and Spakula in <a href="/abs/1101.1993">arXiv:1101.1993v2</a> and gives a new class of non-amenable metric spaces with bounded geometry which coarsely embeds into Hilbert space.;math.GR
1801.04893;On the level of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface;Boix-De Stefani-Vanzo defined the notion of level for a smooth projective hypersurface over a finite field in terms of the stabilisation of a chain of ideals previously considered by \`Alvarez-Montaner-Blickle-Lyubeznik, and showed that in the case of an elliptic curve the level is 1 if and only if it is ordinary and 2 otherwise. Here we extend their theorem to the case of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces by relating their level to the $F$-jumping exponents of Blickle-Musta\c{t}\u{a}-Smith and the Hartshorne-Speiser-Lyubeznik numbers of Musta\c{t}\u{a}-Zhang.;math.AG
1801.04896;Magnetic helicity and subsolutions in ideal MHD;We show that ideal 2D MHD does not possess weak solutions (or even subsolutions) with compact support in time and non-trivial magnetic field. We also show that the $\Lambda$-convex hull of ideal MHD has empty interior in both 2D and 3D, this is seen by finding suitable $\Lambda$-convex functions. As a consequence we show that mean-square magnetic potential is conserved in 2D by subsolutions and weak limits of solutions in the physically natural energy space $L^\infty_t L^2_x$, and in 3D we show the conservation of magnetic helicity by $L^3$-integrable subsolutions and weak limits of solutions. However, in 3D the $\Lambda$-convex hull is shown to be large enough that nontrivial smooth, compactly supported strict subsolutions exist.;math.AP
1801.04902;A spectral method for nonlocal diffusion operators on the sphere;We present algorithms for solving spatially nonlocal diffusion models on the unit sphere with spectral accuracy in space. Our algorithms are based on the diagonalizability of nonlocal diffusion operators in the basis of spherical harmonics, the computation of their eigenvalues to high relative accuracy using quadrature and asymptotic formulas, and a fast spherical harmonic transform. These techniques also lead to an efficient implementation of high-order exponential integrators for time-dependent models. We apply our method to the nonlocal Poisson, Allen--Cahn and Brusselator equations.;math.NA
1801.04904;On classification of higher rank Anosov actions on compact manifold;We prove global smooth classification results for TNS totally Anosov Z^k actions on general compact manifolds, under each one of the following conditions: joint integrability, resonance-free or Lyapunov pinching condition. Unlike the previous results, we do not require any uniform quasiconformality or pinching condition of action elements on coarse Lyapunov distributions, nor do we have any restriction on the dimension of coarse Lyapunov distributions. The main novelty is in proving a new standard form of the derivative cocycle for any TNS totally Anosov Z^k action on general manifold. A main idea is to create a new mechanism called a non-uniform redefining argument to prove continuity of general dynamically-defined object, which should apply to more general rigidity problems in dynamical systems.;math.DS
1801.04905;Corrigendum to the paper &quot,A flexible affine $M$-sextic which is algebraically unrealizable&quot,;We prove the algebraic unrealizability of certain isotopy type of plane affine real algebraic M-sextic which is pseudoholomorphically realizable. This result completes the classification up to isotopy of real algebraic affine M-sextics. The proof of this result given in a previous paper by the first two authors was incorrect.;math.AG
1801.04907;Sending Information Through Status Updates;We consider an energy harvesting transmitter sending status updates regarding a physical phenomenon it observes to a receiver. Different from the existing literature, we consider a scenario where the status updates carry information about an independent message. The transmitter encodes this message into the timings of the status updates. The receiver needs to extract this encoded information, as well as update the status of the observed phenomenon. The timings of the status updates, therefore, determine both the age of information (AoI) and the message rate (rate). We study the tradeoff between the achievable message rate and the achievable average AoI. We propose several achievable schemes and compare their rate-AoI performances.;cs.IT
1801.04915;Phillips symmetric operators and their extensions;Let $S$ be a symmetric operator with equal defect numbers and let $\mathfrak{U}$ be a set of unitary operators in a Hilbert space $\mathfrak{H}$. The operator $S$ is called $\mathfrak{U}$-invariant if $US=SU$ for all $U\in\mathfrak{U}$. Phillips \cite{PH} constructed an example of $\mathfrak{U}$-invariant symmetric operator $S$ which has no $\mathfrak{U}$-invariant self-adjoint extensions. It was discovered that such symmetric operator has a constant characteristic function \cite{KO}. For this reason, each symmetric operator $S$ with constant characteristic function is called a \emph{Phillips symmetric operator}.;math.FA
1801.04920;Secrecy Amplification for Distributed Encrypted Sources with Correlated Keys using Affine Encoders;This paper proposed the application of post-encryption-compression (PEC) to strengthen the secrecy in the case of distributed encryption where the encryption keys are correlated to each other. We derive the universal code construction for the compression and the rate region where codes with achievability and secrecy are obtainable. Our main technique is to use affine encoders which are constructed from certain linear encoders to encode the ciphertexts before sending them to public communication channels. We show that if the rates of linear codes are within a certain rate region:(1) information leakage on the original sources from the encoded ciphertexts without the keys is negligible, while (2) one who has legitimate keys is able to retrieve the original source data with negligible error probability.;cs.IT
1801.04923;An MDS-PIR Capacity-Achieving Protocol for Distributed Storage Using Non-MDS Linear Codes;We propose a private information retrieval (PIR) protocol for distributed storage systems with noncolluding nodes where data is stored using an arbitrary linear code. An expression for the PIR rate, i.e., the ratio of the amount of retrieved data per unit of downloaded data, is derived, and a necessary and a sufficient condition for codes to achieve the maximum distance separable (MDS) PIR capacity are given. The necessary condition is based on the generalized Hamming weights of the storage code, while the sufficient condition is based on code automorphisms. We show that cyclic codes and Reed-Muller codes satisfy the sufficient condition and are thus MDS-PIR capacity-achieving.;cs.IT
1801.04947;A Matrix Positivstellensatz with lifting polynomials;Given the projections of two semialgebraic sets defined by polynomial matrix inequalities, it is in general difficult to determine whether one is contained in the other. To address this issue we propose a new matrix Positivstellensatz that uses lifting polynomials. Under the classical archimedean condition and some mild natural assumptions, we prove that such a containment holds if and only if the proposed matrix Positivstellensatz is satisfied. The corresponding certificate can be searched for by solving a semidefinite program. An important application is to certify when a spectrahedrop (i.e., the projection of a spectrahedron) is contained in another one.;math.OC
1801.04953;Fast Uplink Grant for Machine Type Communications: Challenges and Opportunities;The notion of a fast uplink grant is emerging as a promising solution for enabling massive machine type communications (MTCs) in the Internet of Things over cellular networks. By using the fast uplink grant, machine type devices (MTD) will no longer require random access (RA) channels to send scheduling requests. Instead, uplink resources can be actively allocated to MTDs by the base station. In this paper, the challenges and opportunities for adopting the fast uplink grant to support MTCs are investigated. First, the fundamentals of fast uplink grant and its advantages over conventional access schemes: i) fully scheduled with RA process and ii) uncoordinated access, are presented. Then, the key challenges that include the prediction of set of MTDs with data to transmit, as well as the optimal scheduling of MTDs, are exposed. To overcome these challenges, a two-stage approach that includes traffic prediction and optimized scheduling is proposed. For this approach, various solutions for source traffic prediction for periodic MTD traffic are reviewed and novel methods for event-driven traffic prediction are proposed. For optimal allocation of uplink grants, new solutions based on advanced machine learning methods are presented. By using the proposed solutions, the fast uplink grant has the potential to enable cellular networks to support massive MTCs and effectively reduce the signaling overhead and overcome the delay and congestion challenges of conventional RA schemes.;cs.IT
1801.04955;Tame tori in p-adic groups and good semisimple elements;Let G be a reductive group over a non-archimedean local field k. We provide necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for all tori of G to split over a tamely ramified extension of k. We then show the existence of good semisimple elements in every Moy-Prasad filtration coset of the group G(k) and its Lie algebra, assuming the above sufficient conditions are met.;math.RT
1801.04956;Minimal Free Resolutions of the Tangent Cones of Gorenstein Monomial Curves;The aim of the article is to study the minimal free resolution of the tangent cone of Gorenstein monomial curves in affine 4-space. If C is a non-complete intersection Gorenstein monomial curve that the minimal number of generators of its tangent cone is five, we give the explicit minimal free resolution of the tangent cone of these families of curves and show that the possible Betti sequences are (1,5,6,2) and (1,5,5,1). Also, we give the minimal graded free resolution and compute the Hilbert function of the tangent cone of these families as a result.;math.AC
1801.04960;Emergent Planarity in two-dimensional Ising Models with finite-range Interactions;The known Pfaffian structure of the boundary spin correlations, and more generally order-disorder correlation functions, is given a new explanation through simple topological considerations within the model's random current representation. This perspective is then employed in the proof that the Pfaffian structure of boundary correlations emerges asymptotically at criticality in Ising models on $\mathbb Z^2$ with finite-range interactions. The analysis is enabled by new results on the stochastic geometry of the corresponding random currents. The proven statement establishes an aspect of universality, seen here in the emergence of fermionic structures in two dimensions beyond the solvable cases.;math-ph
1801.04963;Accurate estimates of (1+x)^{1/x} Involved in Carleman Inequality and Keller Limit;In this paper, using the Maclaurin series of the functions $(1+x)^{1/x}$, some inequalities from papers Bicheng Debnath [1998] and Mortici Jang [2015] are generalized. For arbitrary Maclaurin series some general limits of Keller's type are defined and applying for generalization of some well known results.;math.CA
1801.04965;Changing and unchanging of the domination number of a graph: Path addition numbers;Given a graph $G = (V,E)$ and two its distinct vertices $u$ and $v$. The $(u,v)$-$P_k$-{\em addition graph} of $G$ is the graph $G_{u,v,k-2}$ obtained from disjoint union of $G$ and a path $P_k: x_0,x_1,..,x_{k-1}$, $k \geq 2$, by identifying the vertices $u$ and $x_0$, and identifying the vertices $v$ and $x_{k-1}$. We prove that (a) $ \gamma(G)-1 \leq \gamma(G_{u,v,k})$ for all $k \geq 1$, and (b) $\gamma(G_{u,v,k}) &gt, \gamma(G)$ when $k \geq 5$. We also provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the equality $\gamma(G_{u,v,k}) = \gamma(G)$ to be valid for each pair $u,v \in V(G)$. pair $u,v \in V(G)$.;math.CO
1801.04968;On Goodman realizability;Goodman's theorem (1976) states that intuitionistic finite-type arithmetic plus the axiom of choice plus the axiom of relativized dependent choice is conservative over Heyting arithmetic. The same result applies to the extensional variant. This is due to Beeson (1979). In this paper we modify Goodman realizability (1978) and provide a new proof of the extensional case.;math.LO
1801.04970;Product Gauges for Product Domains;In generalized Riemann integration (or Henstock-Kurzweil integration), the formation of the partitions used in Riemann sum construction is regulated by rules known as gauges. This article examines gauges for multi-dimensional Cartesian product domains.;math.CA
1801.04973;Two-Stage LASSO ADMM Signal Detection Algorithm For Large Scale MIMO;This paper explores the benefit of using some of the machine learning techniques and Big data optimization tools in approximating maximum likelihood (ML) detection of Large Scale MIMO systems. First, large scale MIMO detection problem is formulated as a LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) optimization problem. Then, Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is considered in solving this problem. The choice of ADMM is motivated by its ability of solving convex optimization problems by breaking them into smaller sub-problems, each of which are then easier to handle. Further improvement is obtained using two stages of LASSO with interference cancellation from the first stage. The proposed algorithm is investigated at various modulation techniques with different number of antennas. It is also compared with widely used algorithms in this field. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm for both uncoded and coded cases.;cs.IT
1801.04976;Topological K-Theory for Hilbert Scheme Analogs;In geometric representation theory, it is common to compute equivariant $K$ theory of schemes like $Hilb^n ( \mathbb{A}^2 )$ or $Hilb^n (X)$ for an ALE resolution $X \to \mathbb{A}^2 / \Gamma$. If we abandon the algebraic nature and just look at this homotopically we see close relatives of $BS_n$ and $B(\Gamma \wr S_n)$. Therefore we compute the topological K theory of these classifying spaces to fill in a small gap in the literature.;math.AT
1801.04977;Spectra of Tridiagonal Matrices;We characterize the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a class of complex valued tridiagonal $n$ by $n$ matrices subject to arbitrary boundary conditions, i.e. with arbitrary elements on the first and last rows of the matrix. %By boundary conditions, we mean the first and last row of the matrix. For large $n$, we show there are up to $4$ eigenvalues, the so-called \emph{special eigenvalues}, whose behavior depends sensitively on the boundary conditions. The other eigenvalues, the so-called \emph{regular eigenvalues} vary very little as function of the boundary conditions. For large $n$, we determine the regular eigenvalues up to ${\cal O}(n^{-2})$, and the special eigenvalues up to ${\cal O}(\kappa^n)$, for some $\kappa\in (0,1)$. The components of the eigenvectors are determined up to ${\cal O}(n^{-1})$. <br />The matrices we study have important applications throughout the sciences. Among the most common ones are arrays of linear dynamical systems with nearest neighbor coupling, and discretizations of second order linear partial differential equations. In both cases, we give examples where specific choices of boundary conditions substantially influence leading eigenvalues, and therefore the global dynamics of the system.;math.NA
1801.04982;Computing effectively stabilizing controllers for a class of $n$D systems;In this paper, we study the internal stabilizability and internal stabilization problems for multidimensional (nD) systems. Within the fractional representation approach, a multidimen-sional system can be studied by means of matrices with entries in the integral domain of structurally stable rational fractions, namely the ring of rational functions which have no poles in the closed unit polydisc U n = {z = (z 1 ,. .. , z n) $\in$ C n | |z 1 | 1,. .. , |z n | 1}. It is known that the internal stabilizability of a multidimensional system can be investigated by studying a certain polynomial ideal I = p 1 ,. .. , p r that can be explicitly described in terms of the transfer matrix of the plant. More precisely the system is stabilizable if and only if V (I) = {z $\in$ C n | p 1 (z) = $\times$ $\times$ $\times$ = p r (z) = 0} $\cap$ U n = $\emptyset$. In the present article, we consider the specific class of linear nD systems (which includes the class of 2D systems) for which the ideal I is zero-dimensional, i.e., the p i 's have only a finite number of common complex zeros. We propose effective symbolic-numeric algorithms for testing if V (I) $\cap$ U n = $\emptyset$, as well as for computing, if it exists, a stable polynomial p $\in$ I which allows the effective computation of a stabilizing controller. We illustrate our algorithms through an example and finally provide running times of prototype implementations for 2D and 3D systems.;math.NA
1801.04984;Space-Time-Parallel Poroelasticity Simulation;The accurate, reliable and efficient numerical approximation of multi-physics processes in heterogeneous porous media with varying media coefficients that include fluid flow and structure interactions is of fundamental importance in energy, environmental, petroleum and biomedical engineering applications fields for instance. Important applications include subsurface compaction drive, carbon sequestration, hydraulic and thermal fracturing and oil recovery. Biomedical applications include the simulation of vibration therapy for osteoporosis processes of trabeculae bones, estimating stress levels induced by tumour growth within the brain or next-generation spinal disc prostheses. <br />Variational space-time methods offers some appreciable advantages such as the flexibility of the triangulation for complex geometries in space and natural local time stepping, the straightforward construction of higher-order approximations and the application of efficient goal-oriented (duality-based) adaptivity concepts. In addition to that, uniform space-time variational methods appear to be advantageous for stability and a priori error analyses of the discrete schemes. Especially (high-order) discontinuous in time approaches appear to have favourable properties due to the weak application of the initial conditions. <br />The development of monolithic multi-physics schemes, instead of iterative coupling methods between the physical problems, is a key component of the research to reduce the modeling error. Special emphasis is on the development of efficient multi-physics and multigrid preconditioning technologies and their implementation. <br />The simulation software DTM++ is a modularised framework written in C++11 and builds on top of deal.II toolchains. The implementation allows parallel simulations from notebooks up to cluster scale.;math.NA
1801.04985;Routeing properties in a Gibbsian model for highly dense multihop networks;We investigate a probabilistic model for routeing in a multihop ad-hoc communication network, where each user sends a message to the base station. Messages travel in hops via other users, used as relays. Their trajectories are chosen at random according to a Gibbs distribution, which favours trajectories with low interference, measured in terms of signal-to-interference ratio. This model was introduced in our earlier paper [KT18], where we expressed, in the limit of a high density of users, the typical distribution of the family of trajectories in terms of a law of large numbers. In the present work, we derive its qualitative properties. We analytically identify the emerging typical scenarios in three extreme regimes. We analyse the typical number of hops and the typical length of a hop, and the deviation of the trajectory from the straight line, (1) in the limit of a large communication area and large distances, and (2) in the limit of a strong interference weight. In both regimes, the typical trajectory approaches a straight line quickly, in regime (1) with equal hop lengths. Interestingly, in regime (1), the typical length of a hop diverges logarithmically in the distance of the transmitter to the base station. We further analyse (3) local and global repulsive effects of a densely populated subarea on the trajectories.;math.OC
1801.04986;Simulation of thin film flows with a moving mesh mixed finite element method;We present an efficient mixed finite element method to solve the fourth-order thin film flow equations using moving mesh refinement. The moving mesh strategy is based on harmonic mappings developed by Li et al. [J. Comput. Phys., 170 (2001), pp. 562-588, and 177 (2002), pp. 365-393]. To achieve a high quality mesh, we adopt an adaptive monitor function and smooth it based on a diffusive mechanism. A variety of numerical tests are performed to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the method. The moving mesh refinement accurately resolves the overshoot and downshoot structures and reduces the computational cost in comparison to numerical simulations using a fixed mesh.;math.NA
1801.04988;Weighted Energy-Dissipation principle for gradient flows in metric spaces;This paper develops the so-called Weighted Energy-Dissipation (WED) variational approach for the analysis of gradient flows in metric spaces. This focuses on the minimization of the parameter-dependent global-in-time functional of trajectories \[ \mathcal{I}_\varepsilon[u] = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-t/\varepsilon}\left( \frac12 |u'|^2(t) + \frac1{\varepsilon}\phi(u(t)) \right) \dd t, \] featuring the weighted sum of energetic and dissipative terms. As the parameter $\varepsilon$ is sent to~$0$, the minimizers $u_\varepsilon$ of such functionals converge, up to subsequences, to curves of maximal slope driven by the functional $\phi$. This delivers a new and general variational approximation procedure, hence a new existence proof, for metric gradient flows. In addition, it provides a novel perspective towards relaxation.;math.AP
1801.04989;$m$-cluster tilted algebras of euclidean type;We consider $m$-cluster tilted algebras arising from quivers of Euclidean type and we give necessary and sufficient conditions for those algebras to be representation finite. For the case $\widetilde{A}$, using the geometric realization, we get a description of representation finite type in terms of $(m+2)$-angulations. We establish which $m$-cluster tilted algebras arise at the same time from quivers of type $A$ and $\widetilde{A}$. Finally, we characterize representation infinite $m$-cluster tilted algebras arising from a quiver of type $\widetilde{A}$ as $m$-relations extensions of some iterated tilted algebra of type $\widetilde{A}$.;math.RT
1801.04995;Extended Mittag-Leffler Function and truncated $&#x3bd,$-fractional derivatives;The main objective of this article is to present $\nu$-fractional derivative $\mu$-differentiable functions by considering 4-parameters extended Mittag-Leffler function (MLF). We investigate that the new $\nu$-fractional derivative satisfies various properties of order calculus such as chain rule, product rule, Rolle's and mean-value theorems for $\mu$-differentiable function and its extension. Moreover, we define the generalized form of inverse property and the fundamental theorem of calculus and the mean-value theorem for integrals. Also, we establish a relationship with fractional integral through truncated $\nu$-fractional integral.;math.CA
1801.04996;Energy-preserving Variational Integrators for Forced Lagrangian Systems;The goal of this paper is to develop energy-preserving variational integrators for time-dependent mechanical systems with forcing. We first present the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle in the extended Lagrangian mechanics framework and derive the extended forced Euler-Lagrange equations in continuous-time. We then obtain the extended forced discrete Euler-Lagrange equations using the extended discrete mechanics framework and derive adaptive time step variational integrators for time-dependent Lagrangian systems with forcing. We consider two numerical examples to study the numerical performance of energy-preserving variational integrators. First, we consider the example of a nonlinear conservative system to illustrate the advantages of using adaptive time-stepping in variational integrators. We show a trade-off between energy-preserving performance and accurate discrete trajectories while choosing an initial time step. In addition, we demonstrate how the implicit equations become more ill-conditioned as the adaptive time step increases through a condition number analysis. As a second example, we numerically simulate a damped harmonic oscillator using the adaptive time step variational integrator framework. The adaptive time step increases monotonically for the dissipative system leading to unexpected energy behavior.;math.NA
1801.04997;Boundedness and compactness characterizations of Cauchy integral commutators on Morrey spaces;Let $C_\Gamma$ be the Cauchy integral operator on a Lipschitz curve $\Gamma$. In this article, the authors show that the commutator $[b,C_\Gamma]$ is bounded (resp., compact) on the Morrey space $L^{p,\,\lambda}(\mathbb R)$ for any (or some) $p\in(1, \infty)$ and $\lambda\in(0, 1)$ if and only if $b\in {\rm BMO}(\mathbb R)$ (resp., ${\rm CMO}(\mathbb R)$). As an application, a factorization of the classical Hardy space $H^1(\mathbb R)$ in terms of $C_\Gamma$ and its adjoint operator is obtained.;math.CA

1801.04999;A fast ADI algorithm for nonlinear Poisson equation in heterogeneous dielectric media;Recently, a nonlinear Poisson equation has been introduced to model nonlinear and nonlocal hyperpolarization effects in electrostatic solute-solvent interaction for biomolecular solvation analysis. Due to a strong nonlinearity associated with the heterogeneous dielectric media, this Poisson model is difficult to solve numerically, particularly for large protein systems. A new pseudo-transient continuation approach is proposed in this paper to efficiently and stably solve the nonlinear Poisson equation. A Douglas type alternating direction implicit (ADI) method is developed for solving the pseudo-time dependent Poisson equation. Different approximations to the dielectric profile in heterogeneous media are considered in the standard finite difference discretization. The proposed ADI scheme is validated by considering benchmark examples with exact solutions and by solvation analysis of real biomolecules with various sizes. Numerical results are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction, experimental measurements, and those obtained from the boundary value problem approach. Since the time stability of the proposed ADI scheme can be maintained even using very large time increments, it is efficient for electrostatic analysis involving hyperpolarization effects.;math.NA
1801.05001;On a certain extension of the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative operator;The main aim of this present paper is to present a new extension of the fractional derivative operator by using the extension of Beta function recently defined by Shadab et al.[19]. Moreover, we establish some results related to the newly defined modified fractional derivative operator such as Mellin transform and relations to extended hypergeometric and Appell's function via generating functions.;math.CA
1801.05002;The self-justifying Elo rating system;We suggest an improvement of the Elo rating system. Whereas Elo's theoretical background remains unaffected, we significantly change the way in which rating values are adjusted. It turns out that the modified system behaves much more naturally, and that it offers several advantages over the classical one. The key idea is a fixed point approach to the definition of the rating values. We provide an algorithm for the purpose of their computation.;math.CA
1801.05003;Bounds for some entropies and special functions;We consider a family of probability distributions depending on a real parameter and including the binomial, Poisson and negative binomial distributions. The corresponding index of coincidence satisfies a Heun differential equation and is a logarithmically convex function. Combining these facts we get bounds for the index of coincidence, and consequently for R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis entropies of order $2$.;math.CA
1801.05004;Heun functions related to entropies;We consider the indices of coincidence for the binomial, Poisson, and negative binomial distributions. They are related in a simple manner to the R\'{e}nyi entropy and Tsallis entropy. We investigate some families of Heun functions containing these indices of coincidence. For the involved Heun functions we obtain closed forms, explicit expressions, or representations in terms of hypergeometric functions.;math.CA
1801.05005;Two-stack-sorting with pop stacks;We consider the set of permutations that are sorted after two passes through a pop stack. We characterize these permutations in terms of forbidden patterns (classical and barred) and enumerate them according to the ascent statistic. Then we show these permutations to be in bijection with a special family of polyominoes. As a consequence, the permutations sortable by this machine are shown to have the same enumeration as three classical permutation classes.;math.CO
1801.05006;Means of iterates;We determine continuous bijections $f$, acting on a real interval into itself, whose $k$-fold iterate is the quasi-arithmetic mean of all its subsequent iterates from $f^0$ up to $f^n$ (where $0\le k\le n$). Namely, we prove that if at most one of the numbers $k,n$ is odd, then such functions consist of at most three affine pieces.;math.CA
1801.05008;Extremal Polynomials and Entire Functions of Exponential Type;In this paper, we discuss asymptotic relations for the approximation of $\left\vert x\right\vert ^{\alpha},\alpha&gt,0$ in $L_{\infty}\left[ -1,1\right] $ by Lagrange interpolation polynomials based on the zeros of the Chebyshev polynomials of first kind. The limiting process reveals an entire function of exponential type for which we can present an explicit formula. As a consequence, we further deduce an asymptotic relation for the Approximation error when $\alpha\rightarrow\infty$. Finally, we present connections of our results together with some recent work of Ganzburg [5] and Lubinsky [10], by presenting numerical results, indicating a possible constructive way towards a representation for the Bernstein constants.;math.CA
1801.05018;Robust port-Hamiltonian representations of passive systems;We discuss the problem of robust representations of stable and passive transfer functions in particular coordinate systems, and focus in particular on the so-called port-Hamiltonian representations. Such representations are typically far from unique and the degrees of freedom are related to the solution set of the so-called Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov linear matrix inequality (LMI). In this paper we analyze robustness measures for the different possible representations and relate it to quality functions defined in terms of the eigenvalues of the matrix associated with the LMI. In particular, we look at the analytic center of this LMI. From this, we then derive inequalities for the passivity radius of the given model representation.;math.OC
1801.05021;Real-time imaging of interfacial damage in layered composites;A theoretical platform is developed for active elastic-wave sensing of (stationary and advancing) fractures along bi-material interfaces in layered composites. Damaged contact surfaces are characterized by a heterogeneous distribution of (elastic) stiffness $\boldsymbol{K}$ which is a-priori unknown. The proposed imaging functional takes advantage of sequential wavefield measurements for non-iterative and concurrent reconstruction of multiple fractures in heterogeneous domains, with an exceptional spatial resolution and with minimal sensitivity to measurement errors and uncertain elasticity of damage zones. This is accomplished through adaptation of the $F_\sharp$-factorization method (FM) applied to elastodynamic wavefields in a sensing sequence i.e. a measurement campaign performed before and after the formation (or evolution) of interfacial fractures. The direct scattering problem is formulated in the frequency domain where the damage support is illuminated by a set of incident P- and S-waves, and thus-induced scattered waves are monitored at the far field. In this setting, the germane mixed reciprocity principle is introduced, and $F_\sharp$-factorization of the differential scattering operator is rigorously established for composite backgrounds. These results lead to the development of an FM-based fracture indicator whose affiliated cost functional is inherently convex, thus, its minimizer can be computed without iterations. This attribute coupled with the reduced sampling space, proposed in this work, remarkably expedite the data inversion process. The performance of proposed imaging functional is demonstrated by a set of numerical experiments.;math.NA
1801.05034;The Perron-Frobenius theorem for multi-homogeneous mappings;The Perron-Frobenius theory for nonnegative matrices has been generalized to order-preserving homogeneous mappings on a cone and more recently to nonnegative multilinear forms. <br />We unify both approaches by introducing the concept of order-preserving multi-homogeneous mappings, their associated nonlinear spectral problems and spectral radii. We show several Perron-Frobenius type results for these mappings addressing existence, uniqueness and maximality of nonnegative and positive eigenpairs. We prove a Collatz-Wielandt principle and other characterizations of the spectral radius and analyze the convergence of iterates of these mappings towards their unique positive eigenvectors. On top of providing a remarkable extension of the nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory to the multi-dimensional case, our contribution poses the basis for several improvements and a deeper understanding of the current spectral theory for nonnegative tensors. In fact, in recent years, important results have been obtained by recasting certain spectral equations for multilinear forms in terms of homogeneous maps, however as our approach is more adapted to such problems, these results can be further refined and improved by employing our new multi-homogeneous setting.;math.SP
1801.05035;Homogenization of the first initial boundary-value problem for parabolic systems: operator error estimates;Let $\mathcal{O}\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ be a bounded domain of class $C^{1,1}$. In $L_2(\mathcal{O},\mathbb{C}^n)$, we consider a selfadjoint matrix second order elliptic differential operator $B_{D,\varepsilon}$, $0&lt,\varepsilon\leqslant1$, with the Dirichlet boundary condition. The principal part of the operator is given in a factorized form. The operator involves first and zero order terms. The operator $B_{D,\varepsilon}$ is positive definite, its coefficients are periodic and depend on $\mathbf{x}/\varepsilon$. We study the behavior of the operator exponential $e^{-B_{D,\varepsilon}t}$, $t&gt,0$, as $\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$. We obtain approximations for the exponential $e^{-B_{D,\varepsilon}t}$ in the operator norm on $L_2(\mathcal{O},\mathbb{C}^n)$ and in the norm of operators acting from $L_2(\mathcal{O},\mathbb{C}^n)$ to the Sobolev space $H^1(\mathcal{O},\mathbb{C}^n)$. The results are applied to homogenization of solutions of the first initial boundary-value problem for parabolic systems.;math.AP
1801.05036;Configurations of points with sum 0;We compute the virtual Poincar\'e polynomials of the configuration space of $n$ ordered points on an elliptic curve with sum 0.;math.CO
1801.05037;A fast new algorithm for weak graph regularity;We provide a deterministic algorithm that finds, in $\epsilon^{-O(1)} n^2$ time, an $\epsilon$-regular Frieze-Kannan partition of a graph on $n$ vertices. The algorithm outputs an approximation of a given graph as a weighted sum of $\epsilon^{-O(1)}$ many complete bipartite graphs. <br />As a corollary, we give a deterministic algorithm for estimating the number of copies of $H$ in an $n$-vertex graph $G$ up to an additive error of at most $\epsilon n^{v(H)}$, in time $\epsilon^{-O_H(1)}n^2$.;math.CO
1801.05043;Resistance growth of branching random networks;Consider a rooted infinite Galton-Watson tree with mean offspring number $m&gt,1$, and a collection of i.i.d. positive random variables $\xi_e$ indexed by all the edges in the tree. We assign the resistance $m^d \xi_e$ to each edge $e$ at distance $d$ from the root. In this random electric network, we study the asymptotic behavior of the effective resistance and conductance between the root and the vertices at depth $n$. Our results generalize an existing work of Addario-Berry, Broutin and Lugosi on the binary tree to random branching networks.;math.PR
1801.05048;Latent nested nonparametric priors;Discrete random structures are important tools in Bayesian nonparametrics and the resulting models have proven effective in density estimation, clustering, topic modeling and prediction, among others. In this paper, we consider nested processes and study the dependence structures they induce. Dependence ranges between homogeneity, corresponding to full exchangeability, and maximum heterogeneity, corresponding to (unconditional) independence across samples. The popular nested Dirichlet process is shown to degenerate to the fully exchangeable case when there are ties across samples at the observed or latent level. To overcome this drawback, inherent to nesting general discrete random measures, we introduce a novel class of latent nested processes. These are obtained by adding common and group-specific completely random measures and, then, normalising to yield dependent random probability measures. We provide results on the partition distributions induced by latent nested processes, and develop an Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler for Bayesian inferences. A test for distributional homogeneity across groups is obtained as a by product. The results and their inferential implications are showcased on synthetic and real data.;math.ST
1801.05054;Heun functions and combinatorial identities;We give closed forms for several families of Heun functions related to classical entropies. By comparing two expressions of the same Heun function, we get several combinatorial identities generalizing some classical ones.;math.CA
1801.05065;Comonad Cohomology of Track Categories;We define a comonad cohomology of track categories and we show it is linked by a long exact sequence to its Dwyer-Kan-Smith cohomology . Under mild hypothesis on the track category, we show that its comonad cohomology coincides, up to dimension shift, with its Dwyer-Kan-Smith cohomology, therefore obtaining an algebraic formulation of the latter. We also specialize our results to the case where the track category is a $2$-groupoid.;math.AT
1801.05067;Gradient estimates for oblique derivative problems via the maximum principle;We prove gradient estimates for solutions of the oblique derivative problem for a large class of elliptic and parabolic quasilinear PDEs. In particular, we expand on previous work of the author using a maximum principle argument. In addition, we prove estimates for the parabolic problem of evolution via mean curvature with nonzero Neumann data, which seem to be new.;math.AP
1801.05069;Triangulations with few vertices of manifolds with non-free fundamental group;We study lower bounds for the number of vertices in a PL-triangulation of a given manifold $M$. While most of the previous estimates are based on the dimension and the connectivity of $M$, we show that further information can be extracted by studying the structure of the fundamental group of $M$ and applying techniques from the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category theory. In particular, we prove that every PL-triangulation of a $d$-dimensional manifold ($d\ge 3$) whose fundamental group is not free has at least $3d+1$ vertices. As a corollary, every $d$-dimensional ($\mathbb{Z}_p$-)homology sphere that admits a PL-triangulation with less than $3d$ vertices is homeomorphic to $S^d$. Another important consequence is that every triangulation with small links of $M$ is combinatorial.;math.GT
1801.05071;A Finite Block Length Achievability Bound for Low Probability of Detection Communication;Low probability of detection (or covert) communication refers to the scenario where information must be sent reliably to a receiver, but with low probability of detection by an adversary. Recent works on the fundamental limits of this communication problem have established achievability and converse bounds that are asymptotic in the block length of the code. This paper uses Gallager's random coding bound to derive a new achievability bound that is applicable to low probability of detection communication in the finite block length regime. Further insights are unveiled that are otherwise hidden in previous asymptotic analyses.;cs.IT

1801.05081;On uniqueness sets of additive eigenvalue problems and applications;In this paper, we provide a simple way to find uniqueness sets for additive eigenvalue problems of first and second order Hamilton--Jacobi equations by using a PDE approach. An application in finding the limiting profiles for large time behaviors of first order Hamilton--Jacobi equations is also obtained.;math.AP
1801.05083;The level set flow of a hypersurface in $\mathbb R^4$ of low entropy does not disconnect;We show that if $\Sigma\subset \mathbb R^4$ is a closed, connected hypersurface with entropy $\lambda(\Sigma)\leq \lambda(\mathbb{S}^2\times \mathbb R)$, then the level set flow of $\Sigma$ never disconnects. We also obtain a sharp version of the forward clearing out lemma for non-fattening flows in $\mathbb R^4$ of low entropy.;math.DG
1801.05089;Reed-Muller Sequences for 5G Grant-free Massive Access;We propose to use second order Reed-Muller (RM) sequence for user identification in 5G grant-free access. The benefits of RM sequences mainly lie in two folds, (i) support of much larger user space, hence lower collision probability and (ii) lower detection complexity. These two features are essential to meet the massive connectivity ($10^7$ links/km$^2$), ultra-reliable and low-latency requirements in 5G, e.g., one-shot transmission ($\leq 1$ms) with $\leq 10^{-4}$ packet error rate. However, the non-orthogonality introduced during sequence space expansion leads to worse detection performance. In this paper, we propose a noise-resilient detection algorithm along with a layered sequence construction to meet the harsh requirements. Link-level simulations in both narrow-band and OFDM-based scenarios show that RM sequences are suitable for 5G.;cs.IT
1801.05095;On the Analysis of Puncturing for Finite-Length Polar Codes: Boolean Function Approach;This paper investigates the impact of puncturing on finite-length polar codes in which a puncturing pattern $\pv^{N}=(p_0,...,p_N)$ is applied to a length-$N$ polar code.. We first introduce two virtual channels to stochastically model the punctured (untransmitted) bits, which are respectively called {\em useless channel model} (UCM) and {\em deterministic channel model} (DCM). Under each model, we derive boolean functions in variables $p_0,...,p_{N-1}$ that can indicate which polarized channels should carry frozen bits. Based on this, we present an efficient method to jointly optimize a puncturing pattern and an information set. Focusing on a fixed information set, we show that there exist the so-called {\em catastrophic} puncturing patterns that will surely lead to a block error and derive their weight distributions recursively. We then propose the two construction methods of a rate-compatible (RC) polar code which ensures that each puncturing pattern in the family is non-catastrophic. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RC polar code outperform the RC Turbo code adopted in LTE.;cs.IT
1801.05097;Boolean Function Analogs of Covering Systems;Bob Hough recently disproved a long-standing conjecture of Paul Erd\H{o}s regarding covering systems. Inspired by his seminal paper, we describe analogs of covering systems to Boolean functions, and more generally, the problem of covering discrete hyper-boxes by non-parallel lower dimensional hyper-subboxes. We point out that very often primes are red herrings. This is definitely the case for covering system, and who knows, perhaps also for the Riemann Hypothesis.;math.CO
1801.05101;On the I/O Costs of Some Repair Schemes for Full-Length Reed-Solomon Codes;Network transfer and disk read are the most time consuming operations in the repair process for node failures in erasure-code-based distributed storage systems. Recent developments on Reed-Solomon codes, the most widely used erasure codes in practical storage systems, have shown that efficient repair schemes specifically tailored to these codes can significantly reduce the network bandwidth spent to recover single failures. However, the I/O cost, that is, the number of disk reads performed in these repair schemes remains largely unknown. We take the first step to address this gap in the literature by investigating the I/O costs of some existing repair schemes for full-length Reed-Solomon codes.;cs.IT
1801.05104;Throughput Maximization in Cloud Radio Access Networks using Network Coding;This paper is interested in maximizing the total throughput of cloud radio access networks (CRANs) in which multiple radio remote heads (RRHs) are connected to a central computing unit known as the cloud. The transmit frame of each RRH consists of multiple radio resources blocks (RRBs), and the cloud is responsible for synchronizing these RRBS and scheduling them to users. Unlike previous works that consider allocating each RRB to only a single user at each time instance, this paper proposes to mix the flows of multiple users in each RRB using instantly decodable network coding (IDNC). The proposed scheme is thus designed to jointly schedule the users to different RRBs, choose the encoded file sent in each of them, and the rate at which each of them is transmitted. Hence, the paper maximizes the throughput which is defined as the number of correctly received bits. To jointly fulfill this objective, we design a graph in which each vertex represents a possible user-RRB association, encoded file, and transmission rate. By appropriately choosing the weights of vertices, the scheduling problem is shown to be equivalent to a maximum weight clique problem over the newly introduced graph. Simulation results illustrate the significant gains of the proposed scheme compared to classical coding and uncoded solutions.;cs.IT
1801.05105;Second Order Spiral Splines;Second order spiral splines are $C^2$ unit-speed planar curves that can be used to interpolate a list $Y$ of $n+1$ points in $\R ^2$ at times specified in some list $T$, where $n\geq 2$. Asymptotic methods are used to develop a fast algorithm, based on a pair of tridiagonal linear systems and standard software. The algorithm constructs a second order spiral spline interpolant for data that is convex and sufficiently finely sampled.;math.NA
1801.05106;A discretized Severi-type theorem with applications to harmonic analysis;In 1901, Severi proved that if $Z$ is an irreducible hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}^4(\mathbb{C})$ that contains a three dimensional set of lines, then $Z$ is either a quadratic hypersurface or a scroll of planes. We prove a discretized version of this result for hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{R}^4$. As an application, we prove that at most $\delta^{-2-\varepsilon}$ direction-separated $\delta$-tubes can be contained in the $\delta$-neighborhood of a low-degree hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^4$. <br />This result leads to improved bounds on the restriction and Kakeya problems in $\mathbb{R}^4$. Combined with previous work of Guth and the author, this result implies a Kakeya maximal function estimate at dimension $3+1/28$, which is an improvement over the previous bound of $3$ due to Wolff. As a consequence, we prove that every Besicovitch set in $\mathbb{R}^4$ must have Hausdorff dimension at least $3+1/28$. Recently, Demeter showed that any improvement over Wolff's bound for the Kakeya maximal function yields new bounds on the restriction problem for the paraboloid in $\mathbb{R}^4$.;math.CA
1801.05112;Exact Error and Erasure Exponents for the Asymmetric Broadcast Channel;Consider the asymmetric broadcast channel with a random superposition codebook, which may be comprised of constant composition or \iid codewords. By applying Forney's optimal decoder for individual messages and the message pair for the receiver that decodes both messages, exact (ensemble-tight) error and erasure exponents are derived. It is shown that the optimal decoder designed to decode the pair of messages achieves the optimal trade-off between the total and undetected exponents associated with the optimal decoder for the private message. Convex optimization-based procedures to evaluate the exponents efficiently are proposed. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the results.;cs.IT
1801.05114;Generalized Reed-Muller codes over Galois rings;Recently, Bhaintwal and Wasan studied the Generalized Reed-Muller codes over the prime power integer residue ring. In this paper, we give a generalization of these codes to Generalized Reed-Muller codes over Galois rings.;cs.IT
1801.05121;Steady-state analysis of the Join the Shortest Queue model in the Halfin-Whitt regime;This paper studies the steady-state properties of the Join the Shortest Queue model in the Halfin-Whitt regime. We focus on the process tracking the number of idle servers, and the number of servers with non-empty buffers. Recently, Eschenfeldt &amp, Gamarnik (2015) proved that a scaled version of this process converges, over finite time intervals, to a two-dimensional diffusion limit as the number of servers goes to infinity. In this paper we prove that the diffusion limit is exponentially ergodic, and that the diffusion scaled sequence of the steady-state number of idle servers and non-empty buffers is tight. Our results mean that the process-level convergence proved in Eschenfeldt &amp, Gamarnik (2015) implies convergence of steady-state distributions. The methodology used is the generator expansion framework based on Stein's method, also referred to as the drift-based fluid limit Lyapunov function approach in Stolyar (2015). One technical contribution to the framework is to show that it can be used as a general tool to establish exponential ergodicity.;math.PR
1801.05126;Group algebra whose unit group is locally nilpotent;We present a complete list of groups $G$ and fields $F$ for which: (i) the group of normalized units V(FG) of the group algebra FG is locally nilpotent, (ii) the group algebra FG has a finite number of nilpotent elements and V(FG) is an Engel group.;math.RA
1801.05128;Free actions of some compact groups on Milnor manifolds;In this paper, we investigate free actions of some compact groups on cohomology real and complex Milnor manifolds. More precisely, we compute the mod 2 cohomology algebra of the orbit space of an arbitrary free $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{S}^1$-action on a compact Hausdorff space with mod 2 cohomology algebra of a real or a complex Milnor manifold. As applications, we deduce some Borsuk-Ulam type results for equivariant maps between spheres and these spaces. For the complex case, we obtain a lower bound on the Schwarz genus, which further establishes the existence of coincidence points for maps to the Euclidean plane.;math.AT
1801.05129;The relevance of Freiman&#x27,s theorem for combinatorial commutative algebra;Freiman's theorem gives a lower bound for the cardinality of the doubling of a finite set in $\RR^n$. In this paper we give an interpretation of his theorem for monomial ideals and their fiber cones. We call a quasi-equigenerated monomial ideal a Freiman ideal, if the set of its exponent vectors achieves Freiman's lower bound for its doubling. Algebraic characterizations of Freiman ideals are given, and finite simple graphs are classified whose edge ideals or matroidal ideals of its cycle matroids are Freiman ideals.;math.AC
1801.05130;Operator splitting for dispersion-generalized Benjamin-Ono equations;We consider the operator splitting for a class of nonlinear equation, which includes the KdV equation, the Benjamin-Ono equation, and the Burgers equation. We prove a first-order approxomation in $\Delta t$ in the Sobolev space for the Godunov splitting, and second-order approximation for the Strang splitting.;math.AP
1801.05137;Total dominator coloring of central graphs;A total dominator coloring of a graph $G$ is a proper coloring of $G$ in which each vertex of the graph is adjacent to every vertex of some color class. The total dominator chromatic number of a graph is the minimum number of color classes in a total dominator coloring of it. Here, we study the total dominator coloring on central graphs by giving some tight bounds for the total dominator chromatic number of the central of a graph, join of two graphs and Nordhaus-Gaddum-like relations. Also we will calculate the total dominator chromatic number of the central of a path, a cycle, a wheel, a complete graph and a complete multipartite graph.;math.CO
1801.05139;Non-commutative crepant resolutions of Hibi rings with small class group;In this paper, we study splitting (or toric) non-commutative crepant resolutions (= NCCRs) of some toric rings. In particular, we consider Hibi rings, which are toric rings arising from partially ordered sets, and show that Gorenstein Hibi rings with class group $\mathbb{Z}^2$ have a splitting NCCR. In the appendix, we also discuss Gorenstein toric rings with class group $\mathbb{Z}$, in which case the existence of splitting NCCRs is already known. We especially observe the mutations of modules giving splitting NCCRs for the three dimensional case, and show the connectedness of the exchange graph.;math.RT
1801.05140;The Dirichlet problem for Fully Nonlinear Equations Arising from Conformal Geometry;We study the Dirichlet problem for a class of curvature equations arising from conformal geometry on Riemannian manifolds $(M^n, g)$ with boundary where $n \geq 3$. We prove there exists a unique solution using the continuity method which is based on \emph{a priori} estimates for admissible solutions. In deriving the estimates, a crucial step is to derive a lower bound for the gradient on the boundary. This is overcome by constructing a cluster of subsolutions.;math.AP
1801.05145;Monoidal categorification of cluster algebras (merged version);We prove that the quantum cluster algebra structure of a unipotent quantum coordinate ring $A_q(\mathfrak{n}(w))$, associated with a symmetric Kac-Moody algebra and its Weyl group element $w$, admits a monoidal categorification via the representations of symmetric Khovanov-Lauda- Rouquier algebras. In order to achieve this goal, we give a formulation of monoidal categorifications of quantum cluster algebras and provide a criterion for a monoidal category of finite-dimensional graded $R$-modules to become a monoidal categorification, where $R$ is a symmetric Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebra. Roughly speaking, this criterion asserts that a quantum monoidal seed can be mutated successively in all the directions, once the first-step mutations are possible. Then, we show the existence of a quantum monoidal seed of $A_q(\mathfrak{n}(w))$ which admits the first-step mutations in all the directions. As a consequence, we prove the conjecture that any cluster monomial is a member of the upper global basis up to a power of $q^{1/2}$. In the course of our investigation, we also give a proof of a conjecture of Leclerc on the product of upper global basis elements.;math.RT
1801.05146;Algorithms for Computing Wiener Indices of Acyclic and Unicyclic Graphs;Let $G=(V(G),E(G))$ be a molecular graph, where $V(G)$ and $E(G)$ are the sets of vertices (atoms) and edges (bonds). A topological index of a molecular graph is a numerical quantity which helps to predict the chemical/physical properties of the molecules. The Wiener, Wiener polarity and the terminal Wiener indices are the distance based topological indices. In this paper, we described a linear time algorithm {\bf(LTA)} that computes the Wiener index for acyclic graphs and extended this algorithm for unicyclic graphs. The same algorithms are modified to compute the terminal Wiener index and the Wiener polarity index. All these algorithms compute the indices in time $O(n)$.;math.CO
1801.05152;Explicit expression of the microscopic renormalized energy for a pinned Ginzburg-Landau functional;We get a new expression of the microscopic renormalized energy for a pinned Ginzburg-Landau type energy modeling small impurities. This is done by obtaining a sharp decomposition for the minimal energy of a Dirichlet type functional with an L $\infty$-weight. In particular we get an explicit expression of the microscopic renormalized energy for a circular impurity. We proceed also to the minimization of this renormalized energy in some cases.;math.AP
1801.05154;On derived equivalences for categories of generalized intervals of a finite poset;We study two constructions related to the intervals of finite posets. The first one is a poset. The second one is more complicated. Loosely speaking it can be seen as a poset with some extra zero-relations. As main result, we show that these two constructions are equivalent at the level of derived categories.;math.CO

1801.05163;Large-scale sublinearly Lipschitz geometry of hyperbolic spaces;Large-scale sublinearly Lipschitz maps have been introduced by Yves Cornulier in order to precisely state his theorems about asymptotic cones of Lie groups. In particular, Sublinearly biLipschitz Equivalences (SBE) are a weak variant of quasiisometries, with the only requirement of still inducing biLipschitz maps at the level of asymptotic cones. We focus here on hyperbolic metric spaces and study properties of their boundary extensions, reminiscent of quasiM{\"o}bius mappings. We give a dimensional invariant on the boundary that allows to distinguish hyperbolic symmetric spaces up to SBE, answering a question of Dru\c{t}u.;math.MG
1801.05165;Scattering and blow-up criteria for 3D cubic focusing nonlinear inhomogeneous NLS with a potential;In this paper, we consider the 3d cubic focusing inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a potential <br />$$ <br />iu_{t}+\Delta u-Vu+|x|^{-b}|u|^{2}u=0,\,\,(t,x) \in {{\bf{R}}\times{\bf{R}}^{3}}, <br />$$ <br />where $0&lt,b&lt,1$. We first establish global well-posedness and scattering for the radial initial data $u_{0}$ in $H^{1}({\bf R}^{3})$ satisfying $M(u_{0})^{1-s_{c}}E(u_{0})^{s_{c}}&lt,\mathcal{E}$ and $\|u_{0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2(1-s_{c})}\|H^{\frac{1}{2}}u_{0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2s_{c}}&lt,\mathcal{K}$ provided that $V$ is repulsive, where $\mathcal{E}$ and $\mathcal{K}$ are the mass-energy and mass-kinetic of the ground states, respectively. Our result extends the results of Hong \cite{H} and Farah-Guzm$\acute{\rm a}$n \cite{FG1} with $b\in(0,\frac12)$ to the case $0&lt,b&lt,1$. We then obtain a blow-up result for initial data $u_{0}$ in $H^{1}({\bf R}^{3})$ satisfying $M(u_{0})^{1-s_{c}}E(u_{0})^{s_{c}}&lt,\mathcal{E}$ and $\|u_{0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2(1-s_{c})}\|H^{\frac{1}{2}}u_{0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2s_{c}}&gt,\mathcal{K}$ if $V$ satisfies some additional assumptions.0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2(1-s_{c})}\|H^{\frac{1}{2}}u_{0}\|_{L^{2}}^{2s_{c}}&gt,\mathcal{K}$ if $V$ satisfies some additional assumptions.;math.AP
1801.05166;On Hamiltonian and Hamilton-connected digraphs;C. Thomassen in \cite{[11]} suggested (see also \cite{[2]}, J. C.Bermond, C. Thomassen, Cycles in Digraphs - A survey, J. Graph Theory 5 (1981) 1-43, Conjectures 1.6.7 and 1.6.8) the following conjectures : <br />1. Every 3-strongly connected digraph of order $n$ and with minimum degree at least $n+1$ is strongly Hamiltonian-connected. <br />2. Let $D$ be a 4-strongly connected digraph of order $n$ such that the sum of the degrees of any pair of non-adjacent vertices is at least $2n+1$.

1801.05169;A two-parameter eigenvalue problem for a class of block-operator matrices;We consider a symmetric block operator spectral problem with two spectral parameters. Under some reasonable restrictions, we state localisation theorems for the pair-eigenvalues and discuss relations to a class of non-self-adjoint spectral problems.;math.SP
1801.05176;The hypergeometric function for the root system of type $A$ with a certain degenerate parameter;We express explicitly the Heckman-Opdam hypergeometric function for the root system of type A with a certain degenerate parameter in terms of the Lauricella hypergeometric function.;math.RT
1801.05177;A theorem on even pancyclic bipartite digraphs;We prove that a strongly connected balanced bipartite directed graph of order $2a\geq 6$ with partite sets $X$ and $Y$ contains cycles of every length $2, 4, \ldots , 2a$, provided $d(x)+d(y)\geq 3a$ for every pair of vertices $x$, $y$ either both in $X$ or both in $Y$.;math.CO
1801.05179;A criterion for the uniform eventual positivity of operator semigroups;Consider a $C_0$-semigroup $(e^{tA})_{t \ge 0}$ on a function space or, more generally, on a Banach lattice $E$. We prove a sufficient criterion for the operators $e^{tA}$ to be positive for all sufficiently large times $t$, while the semigroup itself might not be positive. This complements recently established criteria for the individual orbits of the semigroup to become eventually positive for all positive initial values. We apply our main result to study the qualitative behaviour of the solutions to various partial differential equations.;math.FA
1801.05180;Stochastic grid bundling method for backward stochastic differential equations;In this work, we apply the Stochastic Grid Bundling Method (SGBM) to numerically solve backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs). The SGBM algorithm is based on conditional expectations approximation by means of bundling of Monte Carlo sample paths and a local regress-later regression within each bundle. The basic algorithm for solving the backward stochastic differential equations will be introduced and an upper error bound is established for the local regression. A full error analysis is also conducted for the explicit version of our algorithm and numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate various properties of our algorithm.;math.NA
1801.05181;Nonexistence of proper $p$-biharmonic maps and Liouville type theorems I: case of $p\geq2$;Let $u: (M, g)\to (N, h)$ be a map between Riemannian manifolds $(M, g)$ and $(N, h)$. The $p$-bienergy of $u$ is defined by $E_p(u)=\int_M|\tau(u)|^pd\nu_g$, where $\tau(u)$ is the tension field of $u$ and $p&gt,1$. Critical points of $E_p(\cdot)$ are called $p$-biharmonic maps. In this paper we will prove nonexistence result of proper $p$-biharmonic maps when $p\geq2$. In particular when $M=\mathbb{R}^m$, we get Liouville type results under proper integral conditions , which extend the related results of Baird, Fardoun and Ouakkas \cite{BFO}.;math.DG
1801.05183;A note on the quantization of tensor fields and quantization of mechanical systems;This article continues and completes our previous work J. Phys. Commun. 2 (2018) 025007. We present two methods of quantization associated with a linear connection given on a differentiable manifold. One of these is that presented in the mentioned article. In the final section the equivalence between both methods is demonstrated, as a consequence of a remarkable property of the Riemannian exponential.;math-ph
1801.05187;Future directions in locally compact groups;This text is the preprint version of the concluding chapter for the book New Directions in Locally Compact Groups published by Cambridge University Press in the series Lecture Notes of the LMS. The recent progress on locally compact groups surveyed in that volume also reveals the considerable extent of the unexplored territories. Therefore, we wish to conclude it by mentioning a few open problems related to the material covered in the book and that we consider important at the time of this writing.;math.GR
1801.05189;On the Kernel of $\mathbb{Z}_{2^s}$-Linear Hadamard Codes;The $\mathbb{Z}_{2^s}$-additive codes are subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}^n_{2^s}$, and can be seen as a generalization of linear codes over $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$. A $\mathbb{Z}_{2^s}$-linear Hadamard code is a binary Hadamard code which is the Gray map image of a $\mathbb{Z}_{2^s}$-additive code. It is known that the dimension of the kernel can be used to give a complete classification of the $\mathbb{Z}_4$-linear Hadamard codes. In this paper, the kernel of $\mathbb{Z}_{2^s}$-linear Hadamard codes and its dimension are established for $s &gt, 2$. Moreover, we prove that this invariant only provides a complete classification for some values of $t$ and $s$. The exact amount of nonequivalent such codes are given up to $t=11$ for any $s\geq 2$, by using also the rank and, in some cases, further computations.;cs.IT
1801.05193;Some remark on the existence of infinitely many nonphysical solutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations;We prove that there exist infinitely many distributional solutions with infinite kinetic energy to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $ \mathbb{R}^2 $. We prove as well the existence of infinitely many distributional solutions for Burgers equation in $ \mathbb{R} $.;math.AP
1801.05194;Sparsity Preserving Optimal Control of Discretized PDE Systems;We focus on the problem of optimal control of large-scale systems whose models are obtained by discretization of partial differential equations using the Finite Element (FE) or Finite Difference (FD) methods. The motivation for studying this pressing problem originates from the fact that the classical numerical tools used to solve low-dimensional optimal control problems are computationally infeasible for large-scale systems. Furthermore, although the matrices of large-scale FE or FD models are usually sparse banded or highly structured, the optimal control solution computed using the classical methods is dense and unstructured. Consequently, it is not suitable for efficient centralized and distributed real-time implementations. We show that the a priori (sparsity) patterns of the exact solutions of the generalized Lyapunov equations for FE and FD models are banded matrices. The a priori pattern predicts the dominant non-zero entries of the exact solution. We furthermore show that for well-conditioned problems, the a priori patterns are not only banded but also sparse matrices. On the basis of these results, we develop two computationally efficient methods for computing sparse approximate solutions of generalized Lyapunov equations. Using these two methods and the inexact Newton method, we show that the solution of the generalized Riccati equation can be approximated by a banded matrix. This enables us to develop a novel computationally efficient optimal control approach that is able to preserve the sparsity of the control law. We perform extensive numerical experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.;math.OC
1801.05195;Multicolour containers, extremal entropy and counting;In breakthrough results, Saxton-Thomason and Balogh-Morris-Samotij developed powerful theories of hypergraph containers. In this paper, we explore some consequences of these theories. We use a simple container theorem of Saxton-Thomason and an entropy-based framework to deduce container and counting theorems for hereditary properties of k-colourings of very general objects, which include both vertex- and edge-colourings of general hypergraph sequences as special cases. <br />In the case of sequences of complete graphs, we further derive characterisation and transference results for hereditary properties in terms of their stability families and extremal entropy. This covers within a unified framework a great variety of combinatorial structures, some of which had not previously been studied via containers: directed graphs, oriented graphs, tournaments, multigraphs with bounded multiplicity and multicoloured graphs amongst others. <br />Similar results were recently and independently obtained by Terry.;math.CO
1801.05197;A note on the cross-index of a complete graph based on a linear tree;In this paper it is shown that a complete graph with $n$ vertices has an optimal diagram, i.e., a diagram whose crossing number equals the value of Guy's formula, with a free maximal linear tree and without free hamiltonian cycles for any odd integer $n \ge 7$.;math.GT
1801.05199;The Fermi-Pasta-Ulam problem and its underlying integrable dynamics: an approach through Lyapunov Exponents;FPU models, in dimension one, are perturbations either of the linear model or of the Toda model, perturbations of the linear model include the usual $\beta$-model, perturbations of Toda include the usual $\alpha+\beta$ model. In this paper we explore and compare two families, or hierarchies, of FPU models, closer and closer to either the linear or the Toda model, by computing numerically, for each model, the maximal Lyapunov exponent $\chi$. We study the asymptotics of $\chi$ for large $N$ (the number of particles) and small $\epsilon$ (the specific energy $E/N$), and find, for all models, asymptotic power laws $\chi\simeq C\epsilon^a$, $C$ and $a$ depending on the model. The asymptotics turns out to be, in general, rather slow, and producing accurate results requires a great computational effort. We also revisit and extend the analytic computation of $\chi$ introduced by Casetti, Livi and Pettini, originally formulated for the $\beta$-model. With great evidence the theory extends successfully to all models of the linear hierarchy, but not to models close to Toda.;math.DS
1801.05201;Scaling Laws and Warning Signs for Bifurcations of SPDEs;Critical transitions (or tipping points) are drastic sudden changes observed in many dynamical systems. Large classes of critical transitions are associated to systems, which drift slowly towards a bifurcation point. In the context of stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs), there are results on growth of variance and autocorrelation before a transition, which can be used as possible warning signs in applications. A similar theory has recently been developed in the simplest setting also for stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) for self-adjoint operators in the drift term. This setting leads to real discrete spectrum and growth of the covariance operator via a certain scaling law. In this paper, we develop this theory substantially further. We cover the cases of complex eigenvalues, degenerate eigenvalues as well as continuous spectrum. This provides a fairly comprehensive theory for most practical applications of warning signs for SPDE bifurcations.;math.DS
1801.05203;Forward-Invariance and Wong-Zakai Approximation for Stochastic Moving Boundary Problems;We discuss a class of stochastic second-order PDEs in one space-dimension with an inner boundary moving according to a possibly non-linear, Stefan-type condition. We show that proper separation of phases is attained, i.e., the solution remains negative on one side and positive on the other side of the moving interface, when started with the appropriate initial conditions. To extend results from deterministic settings to the stochastic case, we establish a Wong-Zakai type approximation. After a coordinate transformation the problems are reformulated and analysed in terms of stochastic evolution equations on domains of fractional powers of linear operators.;math.PR
1801.05209;Normal subgroups of the braid group and the metaconjecture of Ivanov;We show that many normal subgroups of the braid group modulo its centre, and of the mapping class group of a sphere with marked points, have the property that their automorphism and abstract commensurator groups are mapping class groups of such spheres. As one application, we establish the automorphism groups of each term in the lower central series and derived series of the pure braid group. We also obtain new proofs of results of Dyer-Grossman and Orevkov, showing that the automorphism groups of the braid group and of its commutator subgroup are isomorphic. We then calculate the automorphism and abstract commensurator groups of each term in the hyperelliptic Johnson filtration, recovering a result of Childers for the Torelli case. The techniques used in the paper rely on resolving a metaconjecture of Nikolai V. Ivanov for "graphs of regions", extending work of Brendle-Margalit.;math.GT
1801.05210;Enabling Quality-Driven Scalable Video Transmission over Multi-User NOMA System;Recently, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been proposed to achieve higher spectral efficiency over conventional orthogonal multiple access. Although it has the potential to meet increasing demands of video services, it is still challenging to provide high performance video streaming. In this research, we investigate, for the first time, a multi-user NOMA system design for video transmission. Various NOMA systems have been proposed for data transmission in terms of throughput or reliability. However, the perceived quality, or the quality-of-experience of users, is more critical for video transmission. Based on this observation, we design a quality-driven scalable video transmission framework with cross-layer support for multi-user NOMA. To enable low complexity multi-user NOMA operations, a novel user grouping strategy is proposed. The key features in the proposed framework include the integration of the quality model for encoded video with the physical layer model for NOMA transmission, and the formulation of multi-user NOMA-based video transmission as a quality-driven power allocation problem. As the problem is non-concave, a global optimal algorithm based on the hidden monotonic property and a suboptimal algorithm with polynomial time complexity are developed. Simulation results show that the proposed multi-user NOMA system outperforms existing schemes in various video delivery scenarios.;cs.IT
1801.05213;Frames of translates for model sets;We study spanning properties of a family of functions translated along simple model sets. We characterize tight frame and dual frame generators for such irregular translates and we apply the results to Gabor systems. We use the connection between model sets and almost periodic functions and rely strongly on a Poisson summations formula for model sets to introduce the so-called bracket product, which then plays a crucial role in our approach. As a corollary to our main results we obtain a density statement for semi-regular Gabor frames.;math.FA
1801.05214;The nonlinear Brascamp-Lieb inequality for simple data;We establish a nonlinear generalisation of the classical Brascamp-Lieb inequality in the case where the Lebesgue exponents lie in the interior of the finiteness polytope. As a corollary we show that the best constant in Young's convolution inequality in a small neighbourhood of the identity of a general Lie group, approaches the euclidean constant as the size of the neighbourhood approaches zero, answering a question of Cowling, Martini, M\"uller and Parcet. Our proof consists of running an efficient, or "tight", induction on scales argument which uses the existence of gaussian extremisers to the underlying linear Brascamp-Lieb inequality in a fundamental way.;math.CA
1801.05221;A fast subspace optimization method for nonlinear inverse problems in Banach spaces with an application in parameter identification;We introduce and analyze a fast iterative method based on sequential Bregman projections for nonlinear inverse problems in Banach spaces. The key idea, in contrast to the standard Landweber method, is to use multiple search directions per iteration in combination with a regulation of the step width in order to reduce the total number of iterations. This method is suitable for both exact and noisy data. In the latter case, we obtain a regularization method. An algorithm with two search directions is used for the numerical identification of a parameter in an elliptic boundary value problem.;math.NA
1801.05224;Device-to-Device Aided Multicasting;We consider a device-to-device (D2D) aided multicast channel, where a transmitter wishes to convey a common message to many receivers and these receivers cooperate with each other. We propose a simple computationally efficient scheme requiring only statistical channel knowledge at transmitter. Our analysis in general topologies reveals that, when the number of receivers $K$ grows to infinity, the proposed scheme guarantees a multicast rate of ${1 \over 2} \log_2(1 + \beta \ln K )$ with high probability for any $\beta &lt, \beta^\star$ where $\beta^\star$ depends on the network topology. This scheme undergoes a phase transition at threshold $\beta^\star \ln K$ where transmissions are successful/unsuccessful with high probability when the SNR is above/below this threshold. We also analyze the outage rate of the proposed scheme in the same setting.;cs.IT
1801.05227;A Survey of Physical Layer Security Techniques for 5G Wireless Networks and Challenges Ahead;Physical layer security which safeguards data confidentiality based on the information-theoretic approaches has received significant research interest recently. The key idea behind physical layer security is to utilize the intrinsic randomness of the transmission channel to guarantee the security in physical layer. The evolution towards 5G wireless communications poses new challenges for physical layer security research. This paper provides a latest survey of the physical layer security research on various promising 5G technologies, including physical layer security coding, massive multiple-input multiple-output, millimeter wave communications, heterogeneous networks, non-orthogonal multiple access, full duplex technology, etc. Technical challenges which remain unresolved at the time of writing are summarized and the future trends of physical layer security in 5G and beyond are discussed.;cs.IT
1801.05240;de Finetti reductions for partially exchangeable probability distributions;We introduce a general framework for de Finetti reduction results, applicable to various notions of partially exchangeable probability distributions. Explicit statements are derived for the cases of exchangeability, Markov exchangeability, and some generalizations of these. Our techniques are combinatorial and rely on the "BEST" theorem, enumerating the Eulerian cycles of a multigraph.;math.PR
1801.05246;Isospectral discrete and quantum graphs with the same flip counts and nodal counts;The existence of non-isomorphic graphs which share the same Laplace spectrum (to be referred to as isospectral graphs) leads naturally to the following question: What additional information is required in order to resolve isospectral graphs? It was suggested by Band, Shapira and Smilansky that this might be achieved by either counting the number of nodal domains or the number of times the eigenfunctions change sign (the so-called flip count). Recently examples of (discrete) isospectral graphs with the same flip count and nodal count have been constructed by K. Ammann by utilising Godsil-McKay switching. Here we provide a simple alternative mechanism that produces systematic examples of both discrete and quantum isospectral graphs with the same flip and nodal counts.;math-ph
1801.05249;Regularity of weak solutions and supersolutions to the porous medium equation;We study the relations between different regularity assumptions in the definition of weak solutions and supersolutions to the porous medium equation. In particular, we establish the equivalence of the conditions $u^m \in L^2_{\rm loc}(0,T,H^1_{\rm loc}(\Omega))$ and $u^\frac{m+1}2 \in L^2_{\rm loc}(0,T,H^1_{\rm loc}(\Omega))$ in the definition of weak solutions. Our proof is based on approximation by solutions to obstacle problems.;math.AP
1801.05251;Simplified Versions of the Conditional Gradient Method;We suggest simple modifications of the conditional gradient method for smooth optimization problems, which maintain the basic convergence properties, but reduce the implementation cost of each iteration essentially. Namely, we propose the step-size procedure without any line-search, and inexact solution of the direction finding subproblem. Preliminary results of computational tests confirm efficiency of the proposed modifications.;math.OC
1801.05252;A probabilistic proof of Perron&#x27,s theorem;We present an alternative proof of Perron's theorem, which is probabilistic in nature. It rests on the representation of the Perron eigenvector as a functional of the trajectory of an auxiliary Markov chain.;math.PR
1801.05253;A new characterization of endogeny;Aldous and Bandyopadhyay have shown that each solution to a recursive distributional equation (RDE) gives rise to recursive tree process (RTP), which is a sort of Markov chain in which time has a tree-like structure and in which the state of each vertex is a random function of its descendants. If the state at the root is measurable with respect to the sigma field generated by the random functions attached to all vertices, then the RTP is said to be endogenous. For RTPs defined by continuous maps, Aldous and Bandyopadhyay showed that endogeny is equivalent to bivariate uniqueness, and they asked if the continuity hypothesis can be removed. We introduce a higher-level RDE that through its $n$-th moment measures contains all $n$-variate RDEs. We show that this higher-level RDE has minimal and maximal fixed points with respect to the convex order, and that these coincide if and only if the corresponding RTP is endogenous. As a side result, this allows us to answer the question of Aldous and Bandyopadhyay positively.;math.PR
1801.05256;Centralizers of normal subsystems revisited;In this paper we revisit two concepts which were originally introduced by Aschbacher and are crucial in the theory of saturated fusion systems: Firstly, we give a new approach to defining the centralizer of a normal subsystem. Secondly, we revisit the construction of the product of two normal subsystems which centralize each other.;math.GR
1801.05257;Conics, Twistors, and anti-self-dual tri-K&#xe4,hler metrics;We describe the range of the Radon transform on the space $M$ of irreducible conics in $\CP^2$ in terms of natural differential operators associated to the $SO(3)$-structure on $M=SL(3, \R)/SO(3)$ and its complexification. Following \cite{moraru} we show that for any function $F$ in this range, the zero locus of $F$ is a four-manifold admitting an anti-self-dual conformal structure which contains three different scalar-flat K\"ahler metrics. The corresponding twistor space ${\mathcal Z}$ admits a holomorphic fibration over $\CP^2$. In the special case where ${\mathcal Z}=\CP^3\setminus\CP^1$ the twistor lines project down to a four-parameter family of conics which form triangular Poncelet pairs with a fixed base conic.;math.DG
1801.05259;Hamiltonian partial differential equations and symplectic scale manifolds;This paper defines symplectic scale manifolds based on Hofer-Wysocki-Zehnder's scale calculus. We introduce Hamiltonian vector fields and flows on these by narrowing down sc-smoothness to what we denote by strong sc-smoothness, a concept which effectively formalizes the desired smoothness properties for Hamiltonian functions. We show the concept to be invariant under sc-smooth symplectomorphisms, whence it is compatible with Hofer's scale manifolds. We develop and verify the theory at the hand of the free Schr\"odinger equation.;math.SG
1801.05261;Operators with Wentzell boundary conditions and the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator;In this paper we relate the generator property of an operator $A$ with (abstract) generalized Wentzell boundary conditions on a Banach space $X$ and its associated (abstract) Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator $N$ acting on a "boundary" space $\partial X$. Our approach is based on similarity transformations and perturbation arguments and allows to split $A$ into an operator $A_{00}$ with Dirichlet-type boundary conditions on a space $X_0$ of states having "zero trace" and the operator $N$. If $A_{00}$ generates an analytic semigroup, we obtain under a weak Hille--Yosida type condition that $A$ generates an analytic semigroup on $X$ if and only if $N$ does so on $\partial X$. Here we assume that the (abstract) "trace" operator $L:X\to\partial X$ is bounded what is typically satisfied if $X$ is a space of continuous functions. Concrete applications are made to various second order differential operators.;math.FA
1801.05262;Root number of the twists of an elliptic curve;We give an explicit description of the behaviour of the root number in the family given by twists of an elliptic curve $E$ by the rational values of a polynomial $f(T)$. In particular, we give a criterion (on $f$ depending on $E$) for the family to have a constant root number over $\mathbb{Q}$. This completes a work of Rohrlich: we detail the behaviour of the root number when $E$ has bad reduction over $\mathbb{Q}^{ab}$ and we treat the cases $j(E)=0,1728$ which were not considered previously.;math.NT
1801.05263;Maximum principles at infinity and the Ahlfors-Khas&#x27,minskii duality: an overview;This note is meant to introduce the reader to a duality principle for nonlinear equations that recently appeared in the literature. Motivations come from the desire to give a unifying potential-theoretic framework for various maximum principles at infinity appearing in the literature (Ekeland, Omori-Yau, Pigola-Rigoli-Setti), as well as to describe their interplay with properties coming from stochastic analysis on manifolds. The duality involves an appropriate version of these principles formulated for viscosity subsolutions of fully nonlinear inequalities, called the Ahlfors property, and the existence of suitable exhaustion functions called Khas'minskii potentials. We discuss applications, also involving the geometry of submanifolds, in the last sections, as well as the stability of these maximum principles when we remove polar sets.;math.DG
1801.05265;Robust sustainable development assessment with composite indices aggregating interacting dimensions: the hierarchical-SMAA-Choquet integral approach;The evaluation of sustainable development - and, in particular, rural development - through composite indices requires taking into account a plurality of indicators, which are related to economic, social and environmental aspects. The points of view evaluated by these indices are naturally interacting: thus, a bonus has to be recognized to units performing well on synergic criteria, whereas a penalization has to be assigned on redundant criteria. An additional difficulty of the modelization is the elicitation of the parameters for the composite indices, since they are typically affected by some imprecision. In most approaches, all these critical points are usually neglected, which in turn yields an unpleasant degree of approximation in the computation of indices. In this paper we propose a methodology that allows one to simultaneously handle these delicate issues. Specifically, to take into account synergy and redundancy between criteria, we suitably aggregate indicators by means of the Choquet integral. Further, to obtain recommendations that take into account the space of fluctuation related to imprecision in nonadditive weights (capacity of the Choquet integral), we adopt the Robust Ordinal Regression (ROR) and the Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA). Finally, to study sustainability not only at a comprehensive level (taking into account all criteria) but also at a local level (separately taking into account economic, social and environmental aspects), we apply the Multiple Criteria Hierarchy Process (MCHP). We illustrate the advantages of our approach in a concrete example, in which we measure the rural sustainability of 51 municipalities in the province of Catania, the largest city of the East Coast of Sicily (Italy).;math.OC
1801.05271;On Some Linear Codes;Linear code with complementary dual($LCD$) are those codes which meet their duals trivially. In this paper we will give rather alternative proof of Massey's theorem\cite{Massey2}, which is one of the most important characterization of $LCD$ codes. Let $LCD[n,k]_3$ denote the maximum of possible values of $d$ among $[n,k,d]$ ternary codes. We will give bound on $LCD[n,k]_3$. We will also discuss the cases when this bound is attained.;cs.IT
1801.05274;Fractional velocity as a tool for the study of non-linear problems;Singular functions and, in general, H\"older functions represent conceptual models of nonlinear physical phenomena. The purpose of this survey is to demonstrate the applicability of fractional velocity as a tool to characterize Holder and in particular singular functions. Fractional velocities are defined as limit of the difference quotient of a fractional power and they generalize the local notion of a derivative. On the other hand, their properties contrast some of the usual properties of derivatives. One of the most peculiar properties of these operators is that the set of their non trivial values is disconnected. This can be used for example to model instantaneous interactions, for example Langevin dynamics. Examples are given by the De Rham and Neidinger's functions, represented by iterative function systems. Finally the conditions for equivalence with the Kolwankar-Gangal local fractional derivative are investigated.;math.CA
1801.05275;Two-weight, weak type norm inequalities for fractional integral operators and commutators on weighted Morrey and amalgam spaces;Let $0&lt,\gamma&lt,n$ and $I_\gamma$ be the fractional integral operator of order $\gamma$, $I_{\gamma}f(x)=\int_{\mathbb R^n}|x-y|^{\gamma-n}f(y)\,dy$, and let $[b,I_\gamma]$ be the linear commutator generated by a symbol function $b$ and $I_\gamma$, $[b,I_{\gamma}]f(x)=b(x)\cdot I_{\gamma}f(x)-I_\gamma(bf)(x)$. This paper is concerned with two-weight, weak type norm estimates for such operators on the weighted Morrey and amalgam spaces. Based on weak-type norm inequalities on weighted Lebesgue spaces and certain $A_p$-type conditions on pairs of weights, we can establish the weak-type norm inequalities for fractional integral operator $I_{\gamma}$ as well as the corresponding commutator in the framework of weighted Morrey and amalgam spaces.

1801.05282;Some Extremal Values of the Number of Congruences of a Finite Lattice;We study the smallest, as well as the largest numbers of congruences of lattices of an arbitrary finite cardinality $n$. Continuing the work of Freese and Cz\' edli, we prove that the third, fourth and fifth largest numbers of congruences of an $n$--element lattice are: $5\cdot 2^{n-5}$ if $n\geq 5$, respectively $2^{n-3}$ and $7\cdot 2^{n-6}$ if $n\geq 6$. We also determine the structures of the $n$--element lattices having $5\cdot 2^{n-5}$, respectively $2^{n-3}$ congruences, along with the structures of their congruence lattices.;math.RA

1801.05294;Bounds on the Effective-length of Optimal Codes for Interference Channel with Feedback;In this paper, we investigate the necessity of finite blocklength codes in distributed transmission of independent message sets over channels with feedback. Previously, it was shown that finite effective length codes are necessary in distributed transmission and compression of sources. We provide two examples of three user interference channels with feedback where codes with asymptotically large effective lengths are sub-optimal. As a result, we conclude that coded transmission using finite effective length codes is necessary to achieve optimality. We argue that the sub-optimal performance of large effective length codes is due to their inefficiency in preserving the correlation between the inputs to the distributed terminals in the communication system. This correlation is made available by the presence of feedback at the terminals and is used as a means for coordination between the terminals when using finite effective length coding strategies.;cs.IT
1801.05296;Spatial nonhomogeneous periodic solutions induced by nonlocal prey competition in a diffusive predator-prey model;The diffusive Holling-Tanner predator-prey model with no-flux boundary conditions and nonlocal prey competition is considered in this paper. We show the existence of spatial nonhomogeneous periodic solutions, which is induced by nonlocal prey competition. In particular, the constant positive steady state can lose the stability through Hopf bifurcation when the given parameter passes through some critical values, and the bifurcating periodic solutions near such values can be spatially nonhomogeneous and orbitally asymptotically stable. This phenomenon is different from that in models without nonlocal effect.;math.DS
1801.05300;An Extension of the Beurling-Chen-Hadwin-Shen Theorem for Noncommutative Hardy Spaces Associated with Finite von Neumann Algebras;In 2015, Yanni Chen, Don Hadwin and Junhao Shen proved a noncommutative version of Beurling's theorems for a continuous unitarily invariant norm $% \alpha $ on a tracial von Neumann algebra $\left( \mathcal{M},\tau \right) $ where $\alpha $ is $\left\Vert \cdot \right\Vert _{1}$-dominating with respect to $\tau $. In the paper, we first define a class of norms $% N_{\Delta }\left( \mathcal{M},\tau \right) $ on $\mathcal{M}$, called determinant, normalized, unitarily invariant continuous norms on $\mathcal{M}$. If $\alpha \in N_{\Delta }\left( \mathcal{M},\tau \right) $, then there exists a faithful normal tracial state $\rho $ on $\mathcal{M}$ such that $\rho \left( x\right) =\tau \left( xg\right) $ for some positive $g\in L^{1}\left( \mathcal{Z},\tau \right) $ and the determinant of $g$ is positive. For every $\alpha \in N_{\Delta }\left( \mathcal{M},\tau \right) $, we study the noncommutative Hardy spaces $% H^{\alpha }\left( \mathcal{M},\tau \right) $, then prove that the Chen-Hadwin-Shen theorem holds for $L^{\alpha }\left( \mathcal{M},\tau \right) $. The key ingredients in the proof of our result include a factorization theorem and a density theorem for $L^{\alpha }\left( \mathcal{M},\rho \right) $.;math.OA
1801.05303;Limit Drift for Complex Feigenbaum Mappings;We study the dynamics of towers defined by fixed points of renormalization for Feigenbaum polynomials in the complex plane with varying order \ell of the critical point. It is known that the measure of the Julia set of the Feigenbaum polynomial is positive if and only if almost every point tends to 0 under the dynamics of the tower for corresponding \ell. That in turn depends on the sign of a quantity called the drift. We prove the existence and key properties of absolutely continuous invariant measures for tower dynamics as well as their convergence when \ell tends to infinity. We also prove the convergence of the drifts to a finite limit which can be expressed purely in terms of the limiting tower which corresponds to a Feigenbaum map with a flat critical point;math.DS
1801.05306;On strong homogeneity of a class of global optimization algorithms working with infinite and infinitesimal scales;The necessity to find the global optimum of multiextremal functions arises in many applied problems where finding local solutions is insufficient. One of the desirable properties of global optimization methods is \emph{strong homogeneity} meaning that a method produces the same sequences of points where the objective function is evaluated independently both of multiplication of the function by a scaling constant and of adding a shifting constant. In this paper, several aspects of global optimization using strongly homogeneous methods are considered. First, it is shown that even if a method possesses this property theoretically, numerically very small and large scaling constants can lead to ill-conditioning of the scaled problem. Second, a new class of global optimization problems where the objective function can have not only finite but also infinite or infinitesimal Lipschitz constants is introduced. Third, the strong homogeneity of several Lipschitz global optimization algorithms is studied in the framework of the Infinity Computing paradigm allowing one to work \emph{numerically} with a variety of infinities and infinitesimals. Fourth, it is proved that a class of efficient univariate methods enjoys this property for finite, infinite and infinitesimal scaling and shifting constants. Finally, it is shown that in certain cases the usage of numerical infinities and infinitesimals can avoid ill-conditioning produced by scaling. Numerical experiments illustrating theoretical results are described.;math.OC
1801.05308;Some binomial formulas for non-commuting operators;Let $D$ and $U$ be linear operators in a vector space (or more generally, elements of an associative algebra with a unit). We establish binomial-type identities for $D$ and $U$ assuming that either their commutator $[D,U]$ or the second commutator $[D,[D,U]]$ is proportional to $U$. <br />Operators $D=d/dx$ (differentiation) and $U$- multiplication by $e^{\lambda x}$ or by $\sin \lambda x$ are basic examples, for which some of these relations appeared unexpectedly as byproducts of an authors' previous medical imaging research.;math.CA
1801.05310;Parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis model with space-time dependent logistic sources on $\mathbb{R}^N$. II. Existence, uniqueness, and stability of strictly positive entire solutions;This work is the second of the series of three papers devoted to the study of asymptotic dynamics in the chemotaxis system with space and time dependent logistic source,$$\partial_tu=\Delta u-\chi\nabla\cdot(u\nabla v)+u(a(x,t)-ub(x,t)),\quad 0=\Delta v-\lambda v+\mu u ,\ x\in\mathbb{R}^N, \ (1) $$where $N\ge1$ is a positive integer, $\chi,\lambda,\mu&gt,0$, and the functions $a(x,t), b(x,t)$ are positive and bounded. In the first of the series, we studied the phenomena of pointwise and uniform persistence, and asymptotic spreading for solutions with compactly supported or front like initials. In the second of the series, we investigate the existence, uniqueness and stability of strictly positive entire solutions. In this direction, we prove that, if $0\le\mu\chi&lt,b_\inf$, then (1) has a strictly positive entire solution, which is time-periodic (respectively time homogeneous) when the logistic source function is time-periodic (respectively time homogeneous). Next, we show that there is positive constant $\chi_0$, such that for every $0\le\chi&lt,\chi_0$, (1) has a unique positive entire solution which is uniform and exponentially stable with respect to strictly positive perturbations. In particular, we prove that $\chi_0$ can be taken to be $b_\inf/2\mu$ when the logistic source function is either space homogeneous or the function $b(x,t)/a(x,t)$ is constant. We also investigate the disturbances to Fisher-KKP dynamics caused by chemotatic effects, and prove that$$\sup_{0&lt,\chi\le\chi_1}\sup_{t_0\in\mathbb{R},t\ge 0}\frac{1}{\chi}\|u_{\chi}(\cdot,t+t_0,t_0,u_0)-u_0(\cdot,t+t_0,t_0,u_0)\|_{\infty}&lt,\infty$$for every $0&lt,\chi_1&lt,b_\inf/\mu$ and every uniformly continuous initial function $u_0$, with $u_{0\inf}&gt,0$, where $(u_\chi(x,t+t_0,t_0,u_0),v_\chi(x,t+t_0,t_0,u_0))$ denotes the unique classical solution of (1) with $u_\chi(x,t_0,t_0,u_0)=u_0(x)$, for every $0\le\chi&lt,b_\inf$.;math.AP
1801.05315;Quasi-Mobius Homeomorphisms of Morse boundaries;The Morse boundary of a proper geodesic metric space is designed to encode hypberbolic-like behavior in the space. A key property of this boundary is that a quasi-isometry between two such spaces induces a homeomorphism on their Morse boundaries. In this paper we investigate when the converse holds. We prove that for $X, Y$ proper, cocompact spaces, a homeomorphism between their Morse boundaries is induced by a quasi-isometry if and only if the homeomorphism is quasi-mobius and 2-stable.;math.GT
1801.05318;Matching, Path Covers, and Total Forcing Sets;A dynamic coloring of the vertices of a graph $G$ starts with an initial subset $S$ of colored vertices, with all remaining vertices being non-colored. At each discrete time interval, a colored vertex with exactly one non-colored neighbor forces this non-colored neighbor to be colored. The initial set $S$ is called a forcing set of $G$ if, by iteratively applying the forcing process, every vertex in $G$ becomes colored. If the initial set $S$ has the added property that it induces a subgraph of $G$ without isolated vertices, then $S$ is called a total forcing set in $G$. The minimum cardinality of a total forcing set in $G$ is its total forcing number, denoted $F_t(G)$. The path cover number of $G$, denoted $\pc(G)$, is the minimum number of vertex disjoint paths such that every vertex belongs to a path in the cover, while the matching number of $G$, denoted $\alpha'(T)$, is the number of edges in a maximum matching of $G$. Let $T$ be a tree of order at least two. We observe that $\pc(T) + 1 \le F_t(T) \le 2\pc(T)$, and we prove that $F_t(T) \le \alpha'(T) + \pc(T)$. Further, we characterize the extremal trees achieving equality in these bounds.;math.CO
1801.05319;Perverse schobers on Riemann surfaces: constructions and examples;This note studies perverse sheaves of categories, or schobers, on Riemann surfaces, following ideas of Kapranov and Schechtman. For certain wall crossings in geometric invariant theory, I construct a schober on the complex plane, singular at each imaginary integer. I use this to obtain schobers for standard flops: in the 3-fold case, I relate these to a further schober on a partial compactification of a stringy Kaehler moduli space, and suggest an application to mirror symmetry.;math.AG
1801.05320;Presentations of parabolics in some elementary Chevalley-Demazure groups;Given a universal elementary Chevalley-Demazure group $E_\Phi^{sc}(R)$ for which its (standard) parabolic subgroups are finitely generated, we consider the problem of classifying which parabolics $P(R) \subset E_\Phi^{sc}(R)$ are finitely presented. We show that, under mild assumptions, this is equivalent to the finite presentability of a suitable retract of $P$ which contains the Levi factor. If the base ring $R$ is a Dedekind domain of arithmetic type, we combine our results with well-known theorems due to Borel-Serre, Abels, Behr and Bux to give a partial classification of finitely presentable $S$-arithmetic subgroups of parabolics in split reductive linear algebraic groups.;math.GR

Then we study the existence of group nonexpansive retractions $P_{i}$ from $C$ onto $\text{Fix}(\mathcal{S})$ such that $P_{i}T_{i} = T_{i}P_{i} = P_{i}$.;math.FA

1801.05326;On volumes of hyperideal tetrahedra with constrained edge lengths;Hyperideal tetrahedra are the fundamental building blocks of hyperbolic 3-manifolds with geodesic boundary. The study of their geometric properties (in particular, of their volume) has applications also in other areas of low-dimensional topology, like the computation of quantum invariants of 3-manifolds and the use of variational methods in the study of circle packings on surfaces. <br />The Schl\"afli formula neatly describes the behaviour of the volume of hyperideal tetrahedra with respect to dihedral angles, while the dependence of volume on edge lengths is worse understood. In this paper we prove that, for every $\ell&lt,\ell_0$, where $\ell_0$ is an explicit constant, regular hyperideal tetrahedra of edge length $\ell$ maximize the volume among hyperideal tetrahedra whose edge lengths are all not smaller than $\ell$. <br />This result provides a fundamental step in the computation of the ideal simplicial volume of an infinite family of hyperbolic 3-manifolds with geodesic boundary.;math.GT

Over larger alphabets, we give some candidates for balanced words (found computationally) having small critical exponents. We also explore a method for proving these results using the automated theorem prover Walnut.;math.CO
1801.05335;Rates in almost sure invariance principle for slowly mixing dynamical systems;We prove the one-dimensional almost sure invariance principle with essentially optimal rates for slowly (polynomially) mixing deterministic dynamical systems, such as Pomeau-Manneville intermittent maps, with H\"older continuous observables. Our rates have form $o(n^\gamma L(n))$, where $L(n)$ is a slowly varying function and $\gamma$ is determined by the speed of mixing. We strongly improve previous results where the best available rates did not exceed $O(n^{1/4})$. To break the $O(n^{1/4})$ barrier, we represent the dynamics as a Young-tower-like Markov chain and adapt the methods of Berkes-Liu-Wu and Cuny-Dedecker-Merlev\`ede on the Koml\'os-Major-Tusn\'ady approximation for dependent processes.;math.DS

1801.05338;Decision-Feedback Detection Strategy for Nonlinear Frequency-Division Multiplexing;By exploiting a causality property of the nonlinear Fourier transform, a novel decision-feedback detection strategy for nonlinear frequency-division multiplexing (NFDM) systems is introduced. The performance of the proposed strategy is investigated both by simulations and by theoretical bounds and approximations, showing that it achieves a considerable performance improvement compared to previously adopted techniques in terms of Q-factor. The obtained improvement demonstrates that, by tailoring the detection strategy to the peculiar properties of the nonlinear Fourier transform, it is possible to boost the performance of NFDM systems and overcome current limitations imposed by the use of more conventional detection techniques suitable for the linear regime.;cs.IT

1801.05347;Mathematical foundations of Accelerated Molecular Dynamics methods;The objective of this review article is to present recent results on the mathematical analysis of the Accelerated Dynamics algorithms introduced by A.F. Voter in collaboration with D. Perez and M. Sorensen. Using the notion of quasi-stationary distribution, one is able to rigorously justify the fact that the exit event from a metastable state for the Langevin or overdamped Langevin dynamics can be modeled by a kinetic Monte Carlo model. Moreover, under some geometric assumptions, one can prove that this kinetic Monte Carlo model can be parameterized using Eyring-Kramers formulas. These are the building blocks required to analyze the Accelerated Dynamics algorithms, to understand their efficiency and their accuracy, and to improve and generalize these techniques beyond their original scope.;math.NA
1801.05349;Joint CSI Estimation, Beamforming and Scheduling Design for Wideband Massive MIMO System;This paper proposes a novel approach for designing channel estimation, beamforming and scheduling jointly for wideband massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems. With the proposed approach, we first quantify the maximum number of user equipments (UEs) that can send pilots which may or may not be orthogonal. Specifically, when the channel has a maximum of $L$ multipath taps, and we allocate $\tilde{M}$ sub-carriers for the channel state information (CSI) estimation, a maximum of $\tilde{M}$ UEs CSI can be estimated ($L$ times compared to the conventional CSI estimation approach) in a massive MIMO regime. Then, we propose to schedule a subset of these UEs using greedy based scheduling to transmit their data on each sub-carrier with the proposed joint beamforming and scheduling design. We employ the well known maximum ratio combiner (MRC) beamforming approach in the uplink channel data transmission. All the analytical expressions are validated via numerical results, and the superiority of the proposed design over the conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission approach is demonstrated using extensive numerical simulations in the long term evolution (LTE) channel environment. The proposed channel estimation and beamforming design is linear and simple to implement.;cs.IT
1801.05355;A Local-global principle for isogenies of composite degree;Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over a number field $K$. If for almost all primes of $K$, the reduction of $E$ modulo that prime has rational cyclic isogeny of fixed degree, we can ask if this forces $E$ to have a cyclic isogeny of that degree over $K$. Building upon the work of Sutherland, Anni, and Banwait-Cremona in the case of prime degree, we consider this question for cyclic isogenies of arbitrary degree.;math.NT

1801.05362;Minimax Optimal Additive Functional Estimation with Discrete Distribution: Slow Divergence Speed Case;This paper addresses an estimation problem of an additive functional of $\phi$, which is defined as $\theta(P,\phi)=\sum_{i=1}^k\phi(p_i)$, given $n$ i.i.d. random samples drawn from a discrete distribution $P=(p_1,...,p_k)$ with alphabet size $k$. We have revealed in the previous paper that the minimax optimal rate of this problem is characterized by the divergence speed of the fourth derivative of $\phi$ in a range of fast divergence speed. In this paper, we prove this fact for a more general range of the divergence speed. As a result, we show the minimax optimal rate of the additive functional estimation for each range of the parameter $\alpha$ of the divergence speed. For $\alpha \in (1,3/2)$, we show that the minimax rate is $\frac{1}{n}+\frac{k^2}{(n\ln n)^{2\alpha}}$. Besides, we show that the minimax rate is $\frac{1}{n}$ for $\alpha \in [3/2,2]$.;cs.IT
1801.05364;An existence result and evolutionary $&#x393,$-convergence for perturbed gradient systems;The initial-value problem for the perturbed gradient flow \[ <br />B(t,u(t)) \in \partial\Psi_{u(t)}(u'(t))+\partial \mathcal E_t(u(t)) \text{ for a.a. } t\in (0,T),\qquad u(0)=u_0 \] with a perturbation $B$ in a Banach space $V$ is investigated, where the dissipation potential $\Psi_u: V\rightarrow [0,+\infty)$ and the energy functional $\mathcal E_t:V\rightarrow (-\infty,+\infty]$ are nonsmooth and supposed to be convex and nonconvex, respectively. The perturbation $B:[0,T]\times V \rightarrow V^*, (t,v)\mapsto B(t,v)$ is assumed to be continuous and satisfies a growth condition. Under additional assumptions on the dissipation potential and the energy functional, existence of strong solutions is shown by proving convergence of a semi-implicit discretization scheme with a variational approximation technique.;math-ph

Simple finite dimensional $\mathcal{A}$-modules are classified, finite dimensional weight modules are shown to be semisimple, $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathcal{A})$ is computed, and the prime spectrum of $\mathcal{A}$ is computed along with its Zariski topology. Finally, it is shown that $\mathcal{A}$ satisfies the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence.;math.QA
1801.05370;Relativistic Lippmann - Schwinger equation;The classical Lippmann-Schwinger equation plays an important role in the scattering theory (non-relativistic case, Schr\"odinger equation). In the present paper we consider the relativistic analogue of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. We represent the corresponding equation in the integral form. Using this integral equation we investigate the stationary scattering problems (relativistic case, Dirac equation). We consider the dynamical scattering problems (relativistic case, Dirac equation) as well.;math-ph

1801.05375;A note on Harris&#x27, ergodic theorem, controllability and perturbations of harmonic networks;We show that elements of control theory, together with an application of Harris' ergodic theorem, provide an alternate method for showing exponential convergence to a unique stationary measure for certain classes of networks of quasi-harmonic classical oscillators coupled to heat baths. With the system of oscillators expressed in the form $\mathrm{d} X_t = A X_t \,\mathrm{d} t + F(X_t) \,\mathrm{d} t + B \,\mathrm{d} W_t$ in $\mathbf{R}^d$, where $A$ encodes the harmonic part of the force and $-F$ corresponds to the gradient of the anharmonic part of the potential, the hypotheses under which we obtain exponential mixing are the following: $A$ is dissipative, the pair $(A,B)$ satisfies the Kalman condition, $F$ grows sufficiently slowly at infinity (depending on the dimension $d$), and the vector fields in the equation of motion satisfy the weak H\"ormander condition in at least one point of the phase space.;math-ph
1801.05377;Ranks and Symmetric Ranks of Cubic Surfaces;We study cubic surfaces as symmetric tensors of format $4 \times 4 \times 4$. We consider the non-symmetric tensor rank and the symmetric Waring rank of cubic surfaces, and show that the two notions coincide over the complex numbers. The corresponding algebraic problem concerns border ranks. We show that the non-symmetric border rank coincides with the symmetric border rank for cubic surfaces. As part of our analysis, we obtain minimal ideal generators for the symmetric analogue to the secant variety from the salmon conjecture. We also give a test for symmetric rank given by the non-vanishing of certain discriminants. The results extend to order three tensors of all sizes, implying the equality of rank and symmetric rank when the symmetric rank is at most seven, and the equality of border rank and symmetric border rank when the symmetric border rank is at most five. We also study real ranks via the real substitution method.;math.AG
1801.05380;On Hecke eigenvalues of Siegel modular forms in the Maass space;In this article, we prove an omega-result for the Hecke eigenvalues $\lambda_F(n)$ of Maass forms $F$ which are Hecke eigenforms in the space of Siegel modular forms of weight $k$, genus two for the Siegel modular group $Sp_2(\Z)$. In particular, we prove $$ \lambda_F(n)= \Omega(n^{k-1}\text{exp} (c \frac{\sqrt{\log n}}{\log\log n})), $$ when $c&gt,0$ is an absolute constant. This improves the earlier result $$ \lambda_F(n)= \Omega(n^{k-1} (\frac{\sqrt{\log n}}{\log\log n})) $$ of Das and the third author. We also show that for any $n \ge 3$, one has $$ \lambda_F(n) \leq n^{k-1}\text{exp} \left(c_1\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}}\right), $$ where $c_1&gt,0$ is an absolute constant. This improves an earlier result of Pitale and Schmidt. Further, we investigate the limit points of the sequence $\{\frac{\lambda_F(n)}{n^{k-1}}\}_{n \in \N}$ and show that it has infinitely many limit points. Finally, we show that $\lambda_F(n) &gt,0$ for all $n$, a result earlier proved by Breulmann by a different technique.;math.NT
1801.05381;Rooted tree maps and the Kawashima relations for multiple zeta values;Recently, inspired by the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of rooted trees, the second named author introduced rooted tree maps as a family of linear maps on the noncommutative polynomial algebra in two letters. These give a class of relations among multiple zeta values, which are known to be a subclass of the so-called linear part of the Kawashima relations. In this paper we show the opposite implication, that is the linear part of the Kawashima relations is implied by the relations coming from rooted tree maps.;math.NT
1801.05393;Coexistence of 5G mmWave Users with Incumbent Fixed Stations over 70 and 80 GHz;Millimeter wave spectrum access over the 70GHz and 80GHz is central to unlocking gigabit connectivity and meeting the explosive growth of mobile traffic. A pressing question, however, is whether fifth-generation (5G) systems can harmoniously coexist with the incumbents of these bands, which are primarily point-to-point fixed stations (FSs). To this end, we thoroughly analyze the impact of 5G coexistence on FSs. Specifically, we first analyze the geometry of existing FSs' deployment using actual databases of these stations. Then, we present a case study on the interference generated from users towards FSs in two populated areas in Chicago, where we use actual building databases to accurately compute the aggregate interference. The analysis and simulation results reveal that the deployment strategy of FSs and the high attenuation losses at 70/80GHz significantly limit the 5G interference, with the majority of FSs experiencing interference levels well below the noise floor.;cs.IT

1801.05398;On the Direction of Discrimination: An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Disparate Impact in Machine Learning;In the context of machine learning, disparate impact refers to a form of systematic discrimination whereby the output distribution of a model depends on the value of a sensitive attribute (e.g., race or gender). In this paper, we propose an information-theoretic framework to analyze the disparate impact of a binary classification model. We view the model as a fixed channel, and quantify disparate impact as the divergence in output distributions over two groups. Our aim is to find a correction function that can perturb the input distributions of each group to align their output distributions. We present an optimization problem that can be solved to obtain a correction function that will make the output distributions statistically indistinguishable. We derive closed-form expressions to efficiently compute the correction function, and demonstrate the benefits of our framework on a recidivism prediction problem based on the ProPublica COMPAS dataset.;cs.IT
1801.05402;Ambulance Emergency Response Optimization in Developing Countries;The lack of emergency medical transportation is viewed as the main barrier to the access of emergency medical care in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). In this paper, we present a robust optimization approach to optimize both the location and routing of emergency response vehicles, accounting for uncertainty in travel times and spatial demand characteristic of LMICs. We traveled to Dhaka, Bangladesh, the sixth largest and third most densely populated city in the world, to conduct field research resulting in the collection of two unique datasets that inform our approach. This data is leveraged to develop machine learning methodologies to estimate demand for emergency medical services in a LMIC setting and to predict the travel time between any two locations in the road network for different times of day and days of the week. We combine our robust optimization and machine learning frameworks with real data to provide an in-depth investigation into three policy-related questions. First, we demonstrate that outpost locations optimized for weekday rush hour lead to good performance for all times of day and days of the week. Second, we find that significant improvements in emergency response times can be achieved by re-locating a small number of outposts and that the performance of the current system could be replicated using only 30% of the resources. Lastly, we show that a fleet of small motorcycle-based ambulances has the potential to significantly outperform traditional ambulance vans. In particular, they are able to capture three times more demand while reducing the median response time by 42% due to increased routing flexibility offered by nimble vehicles on a larger road network.

1801.05405;Uplink Interference Mitigation Techniques for Coexistence of 5G mmWave Users with Incumbents at 70 and 80 GHz;The millimeter wave spectra at 71-76GHz (70GHz) and 81-86GHz (80GHz) have the potential to endow fifth-generation new radio (5G-NR) with mobile connectivity at gigabit rates. However, a pressing issue is the presence of incumbent systems in these bands, which are primarily point-to-point fixed stations (FSs). In this paper, we first identify the key properties of incumbents by parsing databases of existing stations in major cities to devise several modeling guidelines and characterize their deployment geometry and antenna specifications. Second, we develop a detailed uplink interference framework to compute the aggregate interference from outdoor 5G-NR users into FSs. We then present several case studies in dense populated areas, using actual incumbent databases and building layouts. Our simulation results demonstrate promising 5G coexistence at 70GHz and 80GHz as the majority of FSs experience interference well below the noise floor thanks to the propagation losses in these bands and the deployment geometry of the incumbent and 5G systems. For the few FSs that may incur higher interference, we propose several passive interference mitigation techniques such as angular-based exclusion zones and spatial power control. Simulation results show that the techniques can effectively protect FSs, without tangible degradation of the 5G coverage.;eess.SP
1801.05406;Bijective PC-maps of the unipotent radical of the Borel subgroup of the classical symplectic group;Every commutator preserving bijection of the unipotent radical $Up(2n, R)$ of the Borel subgroup of the classical symplectic group of rank at least 4 over a field $F$ such that $6F=F$ is shown to be the composition of a standard automorphism of $Up(2n,R)$ and a central map. The latter is a bijection which acts as the right multiplication by a matrix from the center of $Up(2n,F)$.;math.GR
1801.05411;Expectation Propagation for Approximate Inference: Free Probability Framework;We study asymptotic properties of expectation propagation (EP) -- a method for approximate inference originally developed in the field of machine learning. Applied to generalized linear models, EP iteratively computes a multivariate Gaussian approximation to the exact posterior distribution. The computational complexity of the repeated update of covariance matrices severely limits the application of EP to large problem sizes. In this study, we present a rigorous analysis by means of free probability theory that allows us to overcome this computational bottleneck if specific data matrices in the problem fulfill certain properties of asymptotic freeness. We demonstrate the relevance of our approach on the gene selection problem of a microarray dataset.;cs.IT
1801.05413;Combinatorial Preconditioners for Proximal Algorithms on Graphs;We present a novel preconditioning technique for proximal optimization methods that relies on graph algorithms to construct effective preconditioners. Such combinatorial preconditioners arise from partitioning the graph into forests. We prove that certain decompositions lead to a theoretically optimal condition number. We also show how ideal decompositions can be realized using matroid partitioning and propose efficient greedy variants thereof for large-scale problems. Coupled with specialized solvers for the resulting scaled proximal subproblems, the preconditioned algorithm achieves competitive performance in machine learning and vision applications.;math.OC

1801.05415;Cross-sections of unknotted ribbon disks and algebraic curves;We resolve parts (A) and (B) of Problem 1.100 from Kirby's list by showing that many nontrivial links arise as cross-sections of unknotted holomorphic disks in the four-ball. The techniques can be used to produce unknotted ribbon surfaces with prescribed cross-sections, including unknotted Lagrangian disks with nontrivial cross-sections.;math.GT
1801.05423;A random walk through experimental mathematics;We describe our adventures in creating a new first-year course in Experimental Mathematics that uses active learning. We used a state-of-the-art facility, called The Western Active Learning Space, and got the students to "drive the spaceship" (at least a little bit). This paper describes some of our techniques for pedagogy, some of the vignettes of experimental mathematics that we used, and some of the outcomes. EYSC was a student in the simultaneously-taught senior sister course "Open Problems in Experimental Mathematics" the first time it was taught and an unofficial co-instructor the second time. Jon Borwein attended the Project Presentation Day (the second time) and gave thoughtful feedback to each student. This paper is dedicated to his memory.;math.HO
1801.05451;On Characters and Pure States of *-Algebras;It is easy to see that every character (i.e. unital *-homomorphism to the complex numbers) of a commutative unital associative *-algebra is a pure state (i.e. extreme point in the convex set of all normalized positive linear functionals). This article gives sufficient conditions for the converse to be true as well. In order to formulate these results together with similar ones, e.g. for locally convex *-algebras, the notion of an abstract O*-algebra (unital associative *-algebra with an order defined by positive linear functionals) is introduced. Many concepts and intermediary results discussed here also apply to the non-commutative case.;math.FA
1801.05465;On a bimodal Birnbaum-Saunders distribution with applications to lifetime data;The Birnbaum-Saunders distribution is a flexible and useful model which has been used in several fields. In this paper, a new bimodal version of this distribution based on the alpha-skew-normal distribution is established. We discuss some of its mathematical and inferential properties. We consider likelihood-based methods to estimate the model parameters. We carry out a Monte Carlo simulation study to evaluate the performance of the maximum likelihood estimators. For illustrative purposes, three real data sets are analyzed. The results indicated that the proposed model outperformed some existing models in the literature, in special, a recent bimodal extension of the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution.;math.ST
1801.05466;Testing Separability of Functional Time Series;We derive and study a significance test for determining if a panel of functional time series is separable. In the context of this paper, separability means that the covariance structure factors into the product of two functions, one depending only on time and the other depending only on the coordinates of the panel. Separability is a property which can dramatically improve computational efficiency by substantially reducing model complexity. It is especially useful for functional data as it implies that the functional principal components are the same for each member of the panel. However such an assumption must be verified before proceeding with further inference. Our approach is based on functional norm differences and provides a test with well controlled size and high power. We establish our procedure quite generally, allowing one to test separability of autocovariances as well. In addition to an asymptotic justification, our methodology is validated by a simulation study. It is applied to functional panels of particulate pollution and stock market data.;math.ST
1801.05471;Minimum saturated families of sets;We call a family $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of $[n]$ $s$-saturated if it contains no $s$ pairwise disjoint sets, and moreover no set can be added to $\mathcal{F}$ while preserving this property (here $[n] = \{1,\ldots,n\}$). <br />More than 40 years ago, Erd\H{o}s and Kleitman conjectured that an $s$-saturated family of subsets of $[n]$ has size at least $(1 - 2^{-(s-1)})2^n$. It is easy to show that every $s$-saturated family has size at least $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 2^n$, but, as was mentioned by Frankl and Tokushige, even obtaining a slightly better bound of $(1/2 + \varepsilon)2^n$, for some fixed $\varepsilon &gt, 0$, seems difficult. In this note, we prove such a result, showing that every $s$-saturated family of subsets of $[n]$ has size at least $(1 - 1/s)2^n$. <br />This lower bound is a consequence of a multipartite version of the problem, in which we seek a lower bound on $|\mathcal{F}_1| + \ldots + |\mathcal{F}_s|$ where $\mathcal{F}_1, \ldots, \mathcal{F}_s$ are families of subsets of $[n]$, such that there are no $s$ pairwise disjoint sets, one from each family $\mathcal{F}_i$, and furthermore no set can be added to any of the families while preserving this property. We show that $|\mathcal{F}_1| + \ldots + |\mathcal{F}_s| \ge (s-1)\cdot 2^n$, which is tight e.g.\ by taking $\mathcal{F}_1$ to be empty, and letting the remaining families be the families of all subsets of $[n]$.;math.CO
1801.05474;Upper and lower estimates for numerical integration errors on spheres of arbitrary dimension;In this paper we study the worst-case error of numerical integration on the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{d}\subset\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$, $d\geq2$, for certain spaces of continuous functions on $\mathbb{S}^{d}$. For the classical Sobolev spaces $\mathbb{H}^s(\mathbb{S}^d)$ ($s&gt,\frac d2$) upper and lower bounds for the worst case integration error have been obtained By Brauchart, Hesse, and Sloan earlier in papers. We investigate the behaviour for $s\to\frac d2$ by introducing spaces $\mathbb{H}^{\frac d2,\gamma}(\mathbb{S}^d)$ with an extra logarithmic weight. For these spaces we obtain similar upper and lower bounds for the worst case integration error.;math.CA
1801.05481;Knudsen gas in flat tire;We consider random reflections (according to the Lambertian distribution) of a light ray in a thin variable width (but almost circular) tube. As the width of the tube goes to zero, properly rescaled angular component of the light ray position converges in distribution to a diffusion whose parameters (diffusivity and drift) are given explicitly in terms of the tube width.;math.PR
1801.05483;Pilot Contamination Mitigation with Reduced RF Chains;Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication is a promising technology for increasing spectral efficiency in wireless networks. Two of the main challenges massive MIMO systems face are degraded channel estimation accuracy due to pilot contamination and increase in computational load and hardware complexity due to the massive amount of antennas. In this paper, we focus on the problem of channel estimation in massive MIMO systems, while addressing these two challenges: We jointly design the pilot sequences to mitigate the effect of pilot contamination and propose an analog combiner which maps the high number of sensors to a low number of RF chains, thus reducing the computational and hardware cost. We consider a statistical model in which the channel covariance obeys a Kronecker structure. In particular, we treat two such cases, corresponding to fully- and partially-separable correlations. We prove that with these models, the analog combiner design can be done independently of the pilot sequences. Given the resulting combiner, we derive a closed-form expression for the optimal pilot sequences in the fully-separable case and suggest a greedy sum of ratio traces maximization (GSRTM) method for designing sub-optimal pilots in the partially-separable scenario. We demonstrate via simulations that our pilot design framework achieves lower mean squared error than the common pilot allocation framework previously considered for pilot contamination mitigation.;cs.IT
1801.05484;Puncture repair on metric measure spaces;Motivated by recent interest concerning "puncture repair" in the conformal geometry of compact Riemannian manifolds, a brief exposition on generalisation to the setting of quasiconformal mappings on certain metric measure spaces is presented as well as a brief outline on removability of porous sets.;math.CV
1801.05485;On Rham cohomology of locally trivial Lie groupoids over triangulated manifolds;Based in the isomorphism between Lie algebroid cohomology and piecewise smooth cohomology, it is proved that the Rham cohomology of a locally trivial Lie groupoid $G$ on a smooth manifold $M$ is isomorphic to the piecewise Rham cohomology of $G$, in which $G$ and $M$ are manifolds without boundary and $M$ is smoothly triangulated by a finite simplicial complex $K$ such that, for each simplex $\Delta$ of $K$, the inverse images of $\Delta$ by the source and target mappings of $G$ are transverses submanifolds in the ambient space $G$. As a consequence, it is shown that the piecewise de Rham cohomology of $G$ does not depend on the triangulation of the base.;math.GT
1801.05488;Mayer-Vietoris sequence in cohomology of Lie algebroids on simplicial complexes;It is shown that the Mayer-Vietoris sequence holds for the cohomology of complexes of Lie algebroids which are defined on simplicial complexes and satisfy the compatibility condition concerning restrictions to the faces of each simplex. The Mayer-Vietoris sequence will be obtained as a consequence of the extension lemma for piecewise smooth forms defined on complexes of Lie algebroids.;math.AT
1801.05493;Gorenstein projective objects in functor categories;Let $k$ be a commutative ring, let $\mathcal{C}$ be a small, $k$-linear, Hom-finite, locally bounded category, and let $\mathcal{B}$ be a $k$-linear abelian category. We construct a Frobenius exact subcategory $\mathcal{GP}(\mathcal{G}_P\operatorname{proj}(\mathcal{B}^{\mathcal{C}}))$ of the functor category $\mathcal{B}^{\mathcal{C}}$, and we show that it is a subcategory of the Gorenstein projective objects $\mathcal{GP}(\mathcal{B}^{\mathcal{C}})$ in $\mathcal{B}^{\mathcal{C}}$. Furthermore, we obtain criteria for when $\mathcal{GP}(\mathcal{G}_P\operatorname{proj}(\mathcal{B}^{\mathcal{C}}))=\mathcal{GP}(\mathcal{B}^{\mathcal{C}})$. We show in examples that this can be used to compute $\mathcal{GP}(\mathcal{B}^{\mathcal{C}})$ explicitly.;math.CT
1801.05494;A group commutator involving the last distance matrix and dual distance matrix of a $Q$-polynomial distance-regular graph;Let $\Gamma$ denote the Hamming graph $H(D,r)$ with $r \geq 3$. Consider the distance matrices $\{A_i\}_{i=0}^{D}$ of $\Gamma$. Fix a vertex $x$ of $\Gamma$, and consider the dual distance matrices $\{A_i^{*}\}_{i=0}^{D}$ of $\Gamma$ with respect to $x$. We investigate the group commutator $A_{D}^{-1}A_{D}^{*-1}A_{D}A_{D}^{*}$. We show that this matrix is diagonalizable. We compute its eigenvalues and their eigenspaces. Let $T$ denote the subconstituent algebra of $\Gamma$ with respect to $x$. We describe the action of $A_{D}^{-1}A_{D}^{*-1}A_{D}A_{D}^{*}$ on each irreducible $T$-module.;math.CO
1801.05496;Algorithmic aspects of $M$-Lipschitz mappings of graphs;$M$-Lipschitz mappings of graphs (or equivalently graph-indexed random walks) are a generalization of standard random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$. For $M \in \N$, an \emph{$M$-Lipschitz mapping} of a connected rooted graph $G = (V,E)$ is a mapping $f: V \to \Z$ such that root is mapped to zero and for every edge $(u,v) \in E$ we have $|f(u) - f(v)| \le M$. <br />We study two natural problems regarding graph-indexed random walks. - Computing the maximum range of a graph-indexed random walk for a given graph. - Deciding if we can extend a partial GI random walk into a full GI random walk for a given graph. <br />We show that both these problems are polynomial-time solvable and we show efficient algorithms for them. To our best knowledge, this is the first algorithmic treatment of Lipschitz mappings of graphs. Furthermore, our problem of extending partial mappings is connected to the problem of \emph{list homomorphism} and yields a better run-time complexity for a specific family of its instances.;math.CO
1801.05498;Graph-indexed random walks on special classes of graphs;We investigate the paramater of the average range of $M$-Lipschitz mapping of a given graph. We focus on well-known classes such as paths, complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs and cycles and show closed formulas for computing this parameter and also we conclude asymptotics of this parameter on these aforementioned classes.;math.CO
1801.05499;Exponential decay estimates for fundamental solutions of Schr&#xf6,dinger-type operators;In the present paper we establish sharp exponential decay estimates for operator and integral kernels of the (not necessarily self-adjoint) operators $L=-(\nabla-i\mathbf{a})^TA(\nabla-i\mathbf{a})+V$. The latter class includes, in particular, the magnetic Schr\"odinger operator $-\left(\nabla-i\mathbf{a}\right)^2+V$ and the generalized electric Schr\"odinger operator $-{\rm div }A\nabla+V$. Our exponential decay bounds rest on a generalization of the Fefferman-Phong uncertainty principle to the present context and are governed by the Agmon distance associated to the corresponding maximal function. In the presence of a scale-invariant Harnack inequality, for instance, for the generalized electric Schr\"odinger operator with real coefficients, we establish both lower and upper estimates for fundamental solutions, thus demonstrating sharpness of our results. The only previously known estimates of this type pertain to the classical Schr\"odinger operator $-\Delta +V$.;math.AP
1801.05500;Cellular-Connected UAVs over 5G: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Interference Management;In this paper, an interference-aware path planning scheme for a network of cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is proposed. In particular, each UAV aims at achieving a tradeoff between maximizing energy efficiency and minimizing both wireless latency and the interference level caused on the ground network along its path. The problem is cast as a dynamic game among UAVs. To solve this game, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, based on echo state network (ESN) cells, is proposed. The introduced deep ESN architecture is trained to allow each UAV to map each observation of the network state to an action, with the goal of minimizing a sequence of time-dependent utility functions. Each UAV uses ESN to learn its optimal path, transmission power level, and cell association vector at different locations along its path. The proposed algorithm is shown to reach a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) upon convergence. Moreover, an upper and lower bound for the altitude of the UAVs is derived thus reducing the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves better wireless latency per UAV and rate per ground user (UE) while requiring a number of steps that is comparable to a heuristic baseline that considers moving via the shortest distance towards the corresponding destinations. The results also show that the optimal altitude of the UAVs varies based on the ground network density and the UE data rate requirements and plays a vital role in minimizing the interference level on the ground UEs as well as the wireless transmission delay of the UAV.;cs.IT
1801.05501;An operator that relates to semi-meander polynomials via a two-sided q-Wick formula;We consider the sequence $( Q_n )_{n=1}^{\infty}$ of semi-meander polynomials which are used in the enumeration of semi-meandric systems (a family of diagrams related to the classical stamp-folding problem). We show that for a fixed natural number $d$, the sequence $( Q_n (d) )_{n=1}^{\infty}$ appears as sequence of moments for a compactly supported probability measure $\nu_d$ on the real line. More generally, we consider a two-variable generalization $Q_n (t,u)$ of $Q_n(t)$, which is related to a natural concept of "self-intersecting meandric system", the second variable of $Q_n (t,u)$ keeps track of the crossings of such a system (and one has, in particular, that $Q_n (t,0)$ is the original semi-meander polynomial $Q_n (t)$). We prove that for a fixed natural number $d$ and a fixed real number $q$ with $|q| &lt, 1$, the sequence $( Q_n (d,q) )_{n=1}^{\infty}$ appears as sequence of moments for a compactly supported probability measure $\nu_{d:q}$ on the real line. The measure $\nu_{d,q}$ is found as scalar spectral measure for an operator $T_{d,q}$ constructed by using left and right creation/annihilation operators on a $q$-deformation of the full Fock space introduced by Bozejko and Speicher. The relevant calculations of moments for $T_{d,q}$ are made by using a two-sided version of a (previously studied in the one-sided case) $q$-Wick formula, which involves the number of crossings of a pair-partition.;math.OA
1801.05505;Time functions and $K$-causality between measures;Employing the notion of a coupling between measures, drawn from the optimal transport theory, we study the extension of the Sorkin-Woolgar causal relation $K^+$ onto the space $\mathscr{P}(\mathcal{M})$ of Borel probability measures on a given spacetime $\mathcal{M}$. We show that Minguzzi's characterization of $K^+$ in terms of time functions possesses a "measure-theoretic" generalization. Moreover, we prove that the relation $K^+$ extended onto $\mathscr{P}(\mathcal{M})$ retains its property of antisymmetry for $\mathcal{M}$ stably causal.;math-ph
1801.05506;Local m-adic constancy of F-pure thresholds and test ideals;In this note, we consider a corollary of the ACC conjecture for F-pure thresholds. Specifically, we show that the F-pure threshold (and more generally, the test ideals) associated to a polynomial with an isolated singularity are locally constant in the m-adic topology of the corresponding local ring. As a by-product of our methods, we also describe a simple algorithm for computing all of the F-jumping numbers and test ideals associated to an arbitrary polynomial over an F-finite field.;math.AC

We construct the isomorphism of Clifford algebra modules of sequences of transfer matrices and the boson space of symmetric functions. As an application, tau-functions of transfer matrices immediately arise from classical tau-functions of symmetric functions.;math-ph
1801.05518;A note on strong convergence of implicit scheme for SDEs under local one-sided Lipschitz conditions;Under a local one-sided Lipschitz condition, Krylov [KR] proved the existence and uniqueness of the strong solutions for stochastic differential equations by using the Euler-Maruyama approximation, where he showed that the sequence of numerical solutions converges to the true solution in probability as the stepsize tends to zero. In this note, we shall extend the results in [KR] and investigate an implicit numerical scheme for these equations under a local one-sided Lipschitz condition.;math.NA
1801.05521;Event-triggered Control of Infinite-dimensional Systems;This paper addresses the problem of event-triggered control for infinite-dimensional systems. We employ event-triggering mechanisms that compare the plant state and the error of the control input induced by the event-triggered implementation. Under the assumption that feedback operators are compact, a strictly positive lower bound on the inter-event times can be guaranteed. We show that if the threshold of the event-triggering mechanisms is sufficiently small, then the event-triggered control system with a bounded control operator and a compact feedback operator is exponentially stable. For infinite-dimensional systems with unbounded control operators, we employ two event-triggering mechanisms that are based on system decomposition and periodic event-triggering, respectively, and then analyze the exponential stability of the closed-loop system under each event-triggering mechanism.;math.OC
1801.05523;On the multiple membranes problem;We establish the optimal regularity for solutions to the multiple membranes problem, and perform a blow-up analysis at points on the free boundary with the highest multiplicity. This leads to a complete classification of blow-up profiles in the plane. The main technical tool is a Weiss-type monotonicity formula.;math.AP
1801.05524;Counting Borel Orbits in Symmetric Varieties of Types $BI$ and $CII$;This is a continuation of our combinatorial program on the enumeration of Borel orbits in symmetric varieties of classical types. Here, we determine the generating series the numbers of Borel orbits in $\mathbf{SO}_{2n+1}/\mathbf{S(O}_{2p}\times \mathbf{O}_{2q+1}\mathbf{)}$ (type $BI$) and in $\mathbf{Sp}_n/\mathbf{Sp}_p\times \mathbf{Sp}_q$ (type $CII$). In addition, we explore relations to lattice path enumeration.;math.CO
1801.05527;Cahn--Hilliard inpainting with the double obstacle potential;The inpainting of damaged images has a wide range of applications, and many different mathematical methods have been proposed to solve this problem. Inpainting with the help of Cahn--Hilliard models has been particularly successful, and it turns out that Cahn--Hilliard inpainting with the double obstacle potential can lead to better results compared to inpainting with a smooth double well potential. However, a mathematical analysis of this approach is missing so far. In this paper we give first analytical results for a Cahn--Hilliard double obstacle inpainting model regarding existence of global solutions to the time-dependent problem and stationary solutions to the time-independent problem without constraints on the parameters involved. With the help of numerical results we show the effectiveness of the approach for binary and grayscale images.;math.AP
1801.05530;Notes on Ricci solitons in $f$-cosymplectic manifolds;The purpose of this article is to study an $f$-cosymplectic manifold $M$ admitting Ricci solitons. Here we consider mainly two classes of Ricci solitons on $f$-cosymplectic manifolds. One is the class of contact Ricci solitons. The other is the class of gradient Ricci solitons, for which we give the local classifications of $M$. Meanwhile, we also give some properties of $f$-cosymplectic manifolds.;math.DG
1801.05533;Einstein-Weyl structures on almost cosymplectic manifolds;In this article, we study Einstein-Weyl structures on almost cosymplectic manifolds. First we prove that an almost cosymplectic $(\kappa,\mu)$-manifold is Einstein or cosymplectic if it admits a closed Einstein-Weyl structure or two Einstein-Weyl structures. Next for a three dimensional compact almost $\alpha$-cosymplectic manifold admitting closed Einstein-Weyl structures, we prove that it is Ricc-flat. Further, we show that an almost $\alpha$-cosymplectic admitting two Einstein-Weyl structures is either Einstein or $\alpha$-cosymplectic, provided that its Ricci tensor is commuting. Finally, we prove that a compact $K$-cosymplectic manifold with a closed Einstein-Weyl structure or two special Einstein-Weyl structures is cosymplectic.;math.DG

1801.05538;Stable Phaseless Sampling and Reconstruction of Real-Valued Signals with Finite Rate of Innovations;A spatial signal is defined by its evaluations on the whole domain. In this paper, we consider stable reconstruction of real-valued signals with finite rate of innovations (FRI), up to a sign, from their magnitude measurements on the whole domain or their phaseless samples on a discrete subset. FRI signals appear in many engineering applications such as magnetic resonance spectrum, ultra wide-band communication and electrocardiogram. For an FRI signal, we introduce an undirected graph to describe its topological structure. We establish the equivalence between the graph connectivity and phase retrievability of FRI signals, and we apply the graph connected component decomposition to find all FRI signals that have the same magnitude measurements as the original FRI signal has. We construct discrete sets with finite density explicitly so that magnitude measurements of FRI signals on the whole domain are determined by their samples taken on those discrete subsets. In this paper, we also propose a stable algorithm with linear complexity to reconstruct FRI signals from their phaseless samples on the above phaseless sampling set. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated theoretically and numerically to provide a suboptimal approximation to the original FRI signal in magnitude measurements.;cs.IT
1801.05540;$G_2$-metrics arising from non-integrable special Lagrangian fibrations;We study special Lagrangian fibrations of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$-manifolds, not necessarily torsion-free. In the case where the fiber is a unimodular Lie group $G$, we decompose such $\mathrm{SU}(3)$-structures into triples of solder 1-forms, connection 1-forms and equivariant $3\times3$ positive-definite symmetric matrix-valued functions on principal $G$-bundles over 3-manifolds. As applications, we describe regular parts of $G_2$-manifolds that admit Lagrangian-type 3-dimensional group actions by constrained dynamical systems on the spaces of the triples in the cases of $G=\mathrm{T}^3$ and $\mathrm{SO}(3)$.;math.DG
1801.05543;On a Class of Diffusion-Aggregation Equations;We investigate the diffusion-aggregation equations with degenerate diffusion $\Delta u^m$ and singular interaction kernel $\mathcal{K}_s = (-\Delta)^{-s}$ with $s\in(0,\frac{d}{2})$. We analyze the regime %($m&gt,2-2s/d$, $d$ is the dimension) where the diffusive forces are stronger than the aggregation forces. In such regime, we show existence, uniform boundedness and H\"{o}lder regularity of solutions in the case that either $s&gt,\frac{1}{2}$ or $m&lt,2$. Uniqueness is proved for kernels with $s&gt,1$.;math.AP
1801.05550;The Hardy-Littlewood Maximal Operator on Discrete Morrey Spaces;We discuss the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator on discrete Morrey spaces of arbitrary dimension. In particular, we obtain its boundedness on the discrete Morrey spaces using a discrete version of the Fefferman-Stein inequality. As a corollary, we also obtain the boundedness of some Riesz potentials on discrete Morrey spaces.;math.FA
1801.05553;Wiener-Hopf factorization for time-inhomogeneous Markov chains and its application;In this paper we derive the Wiener-Hopf factorization for a finite-state time-inhomogeneous Markov chain. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to investigate the Wiener-Hopf factorization for time-inhomogeneous Markov chains. In this work we only deal with a special class of time-inhomogeneous Markovian generators, namely piece-wise constant, which allows to use an appropriately tailored randomization technique. Besides the mathematical importance of the Wiener-Hopf factorization methodology, there is also an important computational aspect: it allows for efficient computation of important functionals of Markov chains.;math.PR
1801.05555;Some algebraic and arithmetic properties of Feynman diagrams;This article reports on some recent progresses in Bessel moments, which represent a class of Feynman diagrams in 2-dimensional quantum field theory. Many challenging mathematical problems on these Bessel moments have been formulated as a vast set of conjectures, by David Broadhurst and collaborators, who work at the intersection of high energy physics, number theory and algebraic geometry. We present the main ideas behind our verifications of several such conjectures, which revolve around linear and non-linear sum rules of Bessel moments, as well as relations between individual Feynman diagrams and critical values of modular $L$-functions.;math.NT
1801.05556;Linear recurrence sequences and the duality defect conjecture;It is conjectured that the dual variety of every smooth nonlinear subvariety of dimension $&gt, \frac{2N}{3}$ in projective $N$-space is a hypersurface, an expectation known as the duality defect conjecture. This would follow from the truth of Hartshorne's complete intersection conjecture but nevertheless remains open for the case of subvarieties of codimension $&gt, 2$. A combinatorial approach to proving the conjecture in the codimension $2$ case was developed by Holme, and following this approach Oaland devised an algorithm for proving the conjecture in the codimension $3$ case for particular $N$. This combinatorial approach gives a potential method of proving the duality defect conjecture in many of the cases by studying the positivity of certain homogeneous integer linear recurrence sequences. We give a generalization of the algorithm of Oaland to the higher codimension cases, obtaining with this bounds the degrees of counterexamples would have to satisfy, and using the relationship with recurrence sequences we prove that the conjecture holds in the codimension $3$ case when $N$ is odd.;math.AG
1801.05562;An Explicit CM Type Norm Formula and Effective Nonvanishing of Class Group L-functions for CM Fields;We show that the central value of class group L-functions of CM fields can be expressed in terms of derivatives of real-analytic Hilbert Eisenstein series at CM points. Then, following an idea of Iwaniec and Kowalski we obtain a conditional explicit lower bound of class numbers of CM fields under a weaker assumption. Some results in the proof lead to an effective nonvanishing result for class group L-functions of general CM fields, generalizing the only known ineffective results.;math.NT
1801.05563;Unique Continuation for Sublinear Elliptic Equations Based on Carleman Estimates;In this article we deal with different forms of the unique continuation property for second order elliptic equations with nonlinear potentials of sublinear growth. Under suitable regularity assumptions, we prove the weak and the strong unique continuation property. Moreover, we also discuss the unique continuation property from measurable sets, which shows that nodal domains to these equations must have vanishing Lebesgue measure. Our methods rely on suitable Carleman estimates, for which we include the sublinear potential into the main part of the operator.;math.AP
1801.05565;Robust Modifications of U-statistics and Applications to Covariance Estimation Problems;Let $Y$ be a $d$-dimensional random vector with unknown mean $\mu$ and covariance matrix $\Sigma$. This paper is motivated by the problem of designing an estimator of $\Sigma$ that admits tight deviation bounds in the operator norm under minimal assumptions on the underlying distribution, such as existence of only 4th moments of the coordinates of $Y$. To address this problem, we propose robust modifications of the operator-valued U-statistics, obtain non-asymptotic guarantees for their performance, and demonstrate the implications of these results to the covariance estimation problem under various structural assumptions.;math.ST
1801.05567;Exploiting Diversity in Molecular Timing Channels via Order Statistics;We study diversity in one-shot communication over molecular timing channels. We consider a channel model where the transmitter simultaneously releases a large number of information particles, while the information is encoded in the time of release. The receiver decodes the information based on the random time of arrival of the information particles. The random propagation is characterized by the general class of right-sided unimodal densities. We characterize the asymptotic exponential decrease rate of the probability of error as a function of the number of released particles, and denote this quantity as the system diversity gain. Four types of detectors are considered: the maximum-likelihood (ML) detector, a linear detector, a detector that is based on the first arrival (FA) among all the transmitted particles, and a detector based on the last arrival (LA). When the density characterizing the random propagation is supported over a large interval, we show that the simple FA detector achieves a diversity gain very close to that of the ML detector. On the other hand, when the density characterizing the random propagation is supported over a small interval, we show that the simple LA detector achieves a diversity gain very close to that of the ML detector.;cs.IT
1801.05569;Hybrid functions approach to solve a class of Fredholm and Volterra integro-differential equations;In this paper, we use a numerical method that involves hybrid and block-pulse functions to approximate solutions of systems of a class of Fredholm and Volterra integro-differential equations. The key point is to derive a new approximation for the derivatives of the solutions and then reduce the integro-differential equation to a system of algebraic equations that can be solved using classical methods. Some numerical examples are dedicated for showing efficiency and validity of the method that we introduce.;math.NA
1801.05575;Structure of eigenvectors of random regular digraphs;Let $d$ and $n$ be integers satisfying $C\leq d\leq \exp(c\sqrt{\ln n})$ for some universal constants $c, C&gt,0$, and let $z\in \mathbb{C}$. Denote by $M$ the adjacency matrix of a random $d$-regular directed graph on $n$ vertices. In this paper, we study the structure of the kernel of submatrices of $M-z\,{\rm Id}$, formed by removing a subset of rows. We show that with large probability the kernel consists of two non-intersecting types of vectors, which we call very steep and gradual with many levels. As a corollary, we show, in particular, that every eigenvector of $M$, except for constant multiples of $(1,1,\dots,1)$, possesses a weak delocalization property: its level sets have cardinality less than $Cn\ln^2 d/\ln n$. For a large constant $d$ this provides a principally new structural information on eigenvectors, implying that the number of their level sets grows to infinity with $n$. As a key technical ingredient of our proofs we introduce a decomposition of $\mathbb{C}^n$ into vectors of different degrees of `structuredness', which is an alternative to the decomposition based on the least common denominator in the regime when the underlying random matrix is very sparse.;math.PR
1801.05576;Circular law for sparse random regular digraphs;Fix a constant $C\geq 1$ and let $d=d(n)$ satisfy $d\leq \ln^{C} n$ for every large integer $n$. Denote by $A_n$ the adjacency matrix of a uniform random directed $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices. We show that, as long as $d\to\infty$ with $n$, the empirical spectral distribution of appropriately rescaled matrix $A_n$ converges weakly in probability to the circular law. This result, together with an earlier work of Cook, completely settles the problem of weak convergence of the empirical distribution in directed $d$-regular setting with the degree tending to infinity. As a crucial element of our proof, we develop a technique of bounding intermediate singular values of $A_n$ based on studying random normals to rowspaces and on constructing a product structure to deal with the lack of independence between the matrix entries.;math.PR
1801.05577;The rank of random regular digraphs of constant degree;Let $d$ be a fixed large integer. For any $n$ larger than $d$, let $A_n$ be the adjacency matrix of the random directed $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, with the uniform distribution. We show that $A_n$ has rank at least $n-1$ with probability going to one as $n$ goes to infinity. The proof combines the method of simple switchings and a recent result of the authors on delocalization of eigenvectors of $A_n$.;math.PR
1801.05579;Special Weierstrass points on algebraic curves in $\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$;In this paper we demonstrate that the notion of inflection points and extactic points on plane algebraic curves can be suitably transferred to curves in $\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$. <br />More precisely, we describe osculating curves and study Weierstrass points of algebraic curves in the surface $\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$ with respect to certain linear systems. In particular, we study points where a fiber of $\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$ is tangent, and points with a hyperosculating $(1,1)$-curve. In the first case we find Hessian-like curves that intersect the curve in these points, and in the second case we find a local criteria. Moreover, we provide Pl\"ucker-like formulas for the number of smooth Weierstrass points on a curve. In the special case of rational curves, we use suitable Wronskians to compute these points and their respective Weierstrass weights.;math.AG
1801.05582;Attractors for two dimensional waves with homogeneous Hamiltonians of degree 0;The density stratification in an incompressible fluid is responsible for the propagation of internal waves. In domains with topography, these waves exhibit interesting features. In particular, numerical and lab experiments show that, in two dimensions, for generic forcing frequencies, these waves concentrate on attractors. The goal of this paper is to analyze mathematically this behavior, using tools from spectral theory and microlocal analysis. The same results apply also to inertial waves in rotating fluids.;math-ph
1801.05584;Locating multiple multipolar acoustic sources using the direct sampling method;This work is concerned with the inverse source problem of locating multiple multipolar sources from boundary measurements for the Helmholtz equation. We develop simple and effective sampling schemes for location acquisition of the sources with a single wavenumber. Our algorithms are based on some novel indicator functions whose indicating behaviors could be used to locate multiple multipolar sources. The inversion schemes are totally "direct" in the sense that only simple integral calculations are involved in evaluating the indicator functions. Rigorous mathematical justifications are provided and extensive numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and efficiency of the proposed methods.;math.AP
1801.05587;Stability estimates for non-local scalar conservation laws;We prove the stability of entropy weak solutions of a class of scalar conservation laws with non-local flux arising in traffic modelling. We obtain an estimate of the dependence of the solution with respect to the kernel function, the speed and the initial datum. Stability is obtained from the entropy condition through doubling of variable technique. We finally provide some numerical simulations illustrating the dependencies above for some cost functionals derived from traffic flow applications.;math.AP
1801.05589;On the Proximal Gradient Algorithm with Alternated Inertia;In this paper, we investigate the attractive properties of the proximal gradient algorithm with inertia. Notably, we show that using alternated inertia yields monotonically decreasing functional values, which contrasts with usual accelerated proximal gradient methods. We also provide convergence rates for the algorithm with alternated inertia based on local geometric properties of the objective function. The results are put into perspective by discussions on several extensions and illustrations on common regularized problems.;math.OC
1801.05591;Combinatorics of patience sorting monoids;This paper makes a combinatorial study of the two monoids and the two types of tableaux that arise from the two possible generalizations of the Patience Sorting algorithm from permutations (or standard words) to words. For both types of tableaux, we present Robinson--Schensted--Knuth-type correspondences (that is, bijective correspondences between word arrays and certain pairs of semistandard tableaux of the same shape), generalizing two known correspondences: a bijective correspondence between standard words and certain pairs of standard tableaux, and an injective correspondence between words and pairs of tableaux. <br />We also exhibit formulas to count both the number of each type of tableaux with given evaluations (that is, containing a given number of each symbol). Observing that for any natural number $n$, the $n$-th Bell number is given by the number of standard tableaux containing $n$ symbols, we restrict the previous formulas to standard words and extract a formula for the Bell numbers. Finally, we present a `hook length formula' that gives the number of standard tableaux of a given shape and deduce some consequences.;math.CO
1801.05592;On Harish-Chandra modules of the Lie algebra arising from the $2$-Dimensional Torus;Let $A=\mathbb{C}[t_1^{\pm1},t_2^{\pm1}]$ be the algebra of Laurent polynomials in two variables and $B$ be the set of skew derivations of $A$. Let $L$ be the universal central extension of the derived Lie subalgebra of the Lie algebra $A\rtimes B$. Set $\widetilde{L}=L\oplus\mathbb{C} d_1\oplus\mathbb{C} d_2$, where $d_1$, $d_2$ are two degree derivations. A Harish-Chandra module is defined as an irreducible weight module with finite dimensional weight spaces. In this paper, we prove that a Harish-Chandra module of the Lie algebra $\widetilde{L}$ is a uniformly bounded module or a generalized highest weight (GHW for short) module. Furthermore, we prove that the nonzero level Harish-Chandra modules of $\widetilde{L}$ are GHW modules. Finally, we classify all the GHW Harish-Chandra modules of $\widetilde{L}$.;math.RT
1801.05593;Relation between combinatorial Ricci curvature and Lin-Lu-Yau&#x27,s Ricci Curvature on cell complexes;In this paper we compare the combinatorial Ricci curvature on cell complexes and the LLY-Ricci curvature defined on graphs. A cell complex is correspondence to a graph such that the vertexes are cells and the edges are vectors on the cell complex. We compare this two Ricci curvature by the cooupling and Kantrovich duality.;math.CO
1801.05608;Catalan numbers, Hankel determinants and Fibonacci polynomials;This (partly expository) paper originated from the study of Hankel determinants of convolution powers of Catalan numbers and of Narayana polynomials. This led to some Hankel determinants of signed Catalan numbers whose values are multiples of Fibonacci numbers and to some Hankel determinants of signed central binomial coefficients whose values are multiples of Lucas numbers. Most proofs are computational but we also include a combinatorial one due to Christian Krattenthaler. Finally we formulate some conjectures.;math.CO
1801.05612;Aubry-Mather and weak KAM theories for contact Hamiltonian systems. Part 1: Strictly increasing case;This paper is concerned with the study of Aubry-Mather and weak KAM theories for contact Hamiltonian systems with Hamiltonians $H(x,u,p)$ defined on $T^*M\times\mathbb{R}$, satisfying Tonelli conditions with respect to $p$ and $0&lt,\frac{\partial H}{\partial u}\leqslant \lambda$ for some $\lambda&gt,0$, where $M$ is a connected, closed and smooth manifold. First, we show the uniqueness of the backward weak KAM solutions of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Using the unique backward weak KAM solution $u_-$, we prove the existence of the maximal forward weak KAM solution $u_+$. Next, we analyse Aubry set for the contact Hamiltonian system showing that it is the intersection of two Legendrian pseudographs $G_{u_-}$ and $G_{u_+}$, and that the projection $\pi:T^*M\times \mathbb{R}\to M$ induces a bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism $\pi|_{\tilde{\mathcal{A}}}$ from Aubry set $\tilde{\mathcal{A}}$ onto the projected Aubry set $\mathcal{A}$. At last, we introduce the notion of barrier functions and study their interesting properties along calibrated curves. Our analysis is based on a recent method by [43,44].;math.DS
1801.05623;Existence and multiplicity of solutions for resonant $(p,2)$-equations;We consider Dirichlet elliptic equations driven by the sum of a $p$-Laplacian $(2&lt,p)$ and a Laplacian. The conditions on the reaction term imply that the problem is resonant at both $\pm\infty$ and at zero. We prove an existence theorem (producing one nontrivial smooth solution) and a multiplicity theorem (producing five nontrivial smooth solutions, four of constant sign and the fifth nodal, the solutions are ordered). Our approach uses variational methods and critical groups.;math.AP
1801.05624;Stability for the mailing problem;We prove that optimal traffic plans for the mailing problem in $\mathbb{R}^d$ are stable with respect to variations of the given coupling, above the critical exponent $\alpha=1-1/d$, thus solving an open problem stated in the book "Optimal transportation networks", by Bernot, Caselles and Morel. We apply our novel result to study some regularity properties of the minimizers of the mailing problem. In particular, we show that only finitely many connected components of an optimal traffic plan meet together at any branching point.;math.AP
1801.05625;Biorthogonality and para-orthogonality of $R_I$ polynomials;In this paper, a sequence of linear combination of $R_{I}$ type polynomials such that the terms in this sequence have a common zero is constructed. A biorthogonality relation arising from such a sequence is discussed. Besides a sequence of para-orthogonal polynomials by removing the common zero using suitable conditions is obtained. Finally, a case of hypergeometric functions is studied to illustrate the results obtained.;math.CA
1801.05626;Non-Embedding Theorems of Nilpotent Lie groups and Sub-Riemannian Manifolds;We prove that there do not exist quasi-isometric embeddings of connected nonabelian nilpotent Lie groups equipped with left invariant Riemannian metrics into a metric measure space satisfying the RCD(0,N), with N &gt, 1. In fact, we can prove that a subRiemannian manifold whose generic degree of nonholonomy is not smaller than 2 can not be biLipschitzly embedded in any Banach space with the Radon-Nikodym property. We also get that every regular sub-Riemannian manifold do not satisfy the CD(K,N) with N &gt, 1. We also prove that the subRiemannian manifold is infinitesimally Hilbert space.;math.DG
1801.05628;Zoology in the H&#xe9,non family: twin babies and Milnor&#x27,s swallows;We study $C^{d,r}$-H\'enon-like families $(f_{a\, b})_{a\, b}$ with two parameters $(a,b)\in \mathbb R^2$. We show the existence of an open set of parameters $(a,b)\in \mathcal D$, so that a renormalization chart conjugates an iterate of $f_{a\, b}$ to a perturbation of $(x,y)\mapsto ((x^2+c_1)^2+c_2,0)$. We prove that the map $(a,b)\in \mathcal D\mapsto (c_1,c_2)$ is a $C^d$-diffeomorphism, as first numerically conjectured by Milnor in 1992. <br />Furthermore, we show the existence of an open set of parameters $(a,b)$ so that $f_{a\, b}$ displays exactly two different renormalized H\'enon-like maps whose basins union attracts Lebesgue a.e. point with bounded forward orbit. A great freedom in the choice of the renormalized parameters enables us to deduce in particular the existence of a (unperturbed) H\'enon map with exactly $2$ attracting cycles (an answer to a Question by Lyubich). <br />The proof is based on a generalization of puzzle pieces for H\'enon-like maps, and on a generalization of both the affine-like formalism of Palis-Yoccoz and the cross map of Shilnikov. The distortion bounds enable us to define (for the first time) $C^{r}$ and $C^{d,r}$-renormalizations and multi-renormalizations with bounds on all the derivatives.;math.DS
1801.05629;Game-Theoretical Strategy of Robot in the Area with Dynamical Obstacles;The effectiveness of a robot manipulation to a large extent is determined by the speed of making this or that movement needed for carrying out the task. Accordingly to this the problem of optimal robot control is often subdivided into two subproblems solved separately. In an autonomous regime the trajectory planning is fulfilled for providing the robot movement time close to the minimal.;math.OC
1801.05630;On Global Existence and Blow-up for Damped Stochastic Nonlinear Schr&#xf6,dinger Equation;In this paper, we consider the well-posedness of the weakly damped stochastic nonlinear Schr\"odinger(NLS) equation driven by multiplicative noise. First, we show the global existence of the unique solution for the damped stochastic NLS equation in critical case. Meanwhile, the exponential integrability of the solution is proved, which implies the continuous dependence on the initial data. Then, we analyze the effect of the damped term and noise on the blow-up phenomenon. By modifying the associated energy, momentum and variance identity, we deduce a sharp blow-up condition for damped stochastic NLS equation in supercritical case. Moreover, we show that when the damped effect is large enough, the damped effect can prevent the blow-up of the solution with high probability.;math.PR
1801.05633;The Baire category of the hyperspace of nontrivial convergent sequences;Assume that $X$ is a regular space. We study topological properties of the family $S_c(X)$ of nontrivial convergent sequences in $X$ equipped with the Vietoris topology. We show that if $X$ has no isolated points, then $S_c(X)$ is a space of the first category which answers the question posed by S. Garcia-Ferreira and Y.F. Ortiz-Castillo.;math.GN
1801.05634;Quantum superintegrable system with a novel chain structure of quadratic algebras;We analyse the $n$-dimensional superintegrable Kepler-Coulomb system with non-central terms. We find a novel underlying chain structure of quadratic algebras formed by the integrals of motion. We identify the elements for each sub-structure and obtain the algebra relations satisfied by them and the corresponding Casimir operators. These quadratic sub-algebras are realized in terms of a chain of deformed oscillators with factorized structure functions. We construct the finite-dimensional unitary representations of the deformed oscillators, and give an algebraic derivation of the energy spectrum of the superintegrable system.;math-ph
1801.05636;Weighted quasi-metrics associated with Finsler metrics;The current paper deals with some new classes of Finsler metrics with reversible geodesics. We construct weighted quasi-metrics associated with these metrics. Further, we investigate some important geometric properties of weighted quasi-metric space. Finally, we discuss the embedding of quasi-metric spaces with generalized weight.;math.DG
1801.05645;Pseudospectral bound and transition threshold for the 3D Kolmogorov flow;In this paper, we establish the pseudospectral bound for the linearized operator of the Navier-Stokes equations around the 3D Kolmogorov flow. Using the pseudospectral bound and the wave operator method introduced in [LWZ], we prove the sharp enhanced dissipation rate for the linearized Navier-Stokes equations. As an application, we prove that if the initial velocity satisfies $\big\| U_0-\big(k_f^{-2}\sin(k_fy),0,0\big)\big\|_{H^2}\le c\nu^{\frac{7}{4}}$ ($\nu$ the viscosity coefficient) and $k_f\in (0,1)$, then the solution does not transition away from the Kolmogorov flow.;math.AP
1801.05648;Parallel Block-Preconditioned Monolithic Solvers for Fluid-Structure-Interaction Problems;In this work, we consider the solution of fluid-structure interaction problems using a monolithic approach for the coupling between fluid and solid subproblems. The coupling of both equations is realized by means of the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian framework and a nonlinear harmonic mesh motion model. Monolithic approaches require the solution of large, ill-conditioned linear systems of algebraic equations at every Newton step. Direct solvers tend to use too much memory even for a relatively small number of degrees of freedom, and, in addition, exhibit superlinear grow in arithmetic complexity. Thus, iterative solvers are the only viable option. To ensure convergence of iterative methods within a reasonable amount of iterations, good and, at the same time, cheap preconditioners have to be developed. We study physics-based block preconditioners, which are derived from the block $LDU$-factorization of the FSI Jacobian, and their performance on distributed memory parallel computers in terms of two- and three-dimensional test cases permitting large deformations.;math.NA
1801.05652;Post-Lie algebra structures for nilpotent Lie algebras;We study post-Lie algebra structures on $(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{n})$ for nilpotent Lie algebras. First we show that if $\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent such that $H^0(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{n})=0$, then also $\mathfrak{n}$ must be nilpotent, of bounded class. For post-Lie algebra structures $x\cdot y$ on pairs of $2$-step nilpotent Lie algebras $(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{n})$ we give necessary and sufficient conditions such that $x\circ y=\frac{1}{2}(x\cdot y+y\cdot x)$ defines a CPA-structure on $\mathfrak{g}$, or on $\mathfrak{n}$. As a corollary we obtain that every LR-structure on a Heisenberg Lie algebra of dimension $n\ge 5$ is complete. Finally we classify all post-Lie algebra structures on $(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{n})$ for $\mathfrak{g}\cong \mathfrak{n}\cong \mathfrak{n}_3$, where $\mathfrak{n}_3$ is the $3$-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra.;math.RA
1801.05653;On the stability of the state 1 in the non-local Fisher-KPP equation in bounded domains;We consider the non-local Fisher-KPP equation on a bounded domain with Neu-mann boundary conditions. Thanks to a Lyapunov function, we prove that under a general hypothesis on the Kernel involved in the non-local term, the homogenous steady state 1 is globally asymptotically stable. This assumption happens to be linked to some conditions given in the literature, which ensure that travelling waves link 0 to 1.;math.AP
1801.05654;Expansions of Iterated Stratonovich Stochastic Integrals of Multiplicities 1 to 4. Combained Approach Based on Generalized Multiple and Repeated Fourier series;The article is devoted to the expansions of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of multiplicities 1 to 4 on the base of the combined approach of generalized multiple and repeated Fourier series. We consider two different parts of the expansion of iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals. The mean-square convergence of the first part is proven on the base of generalized multiple Fourier series, converging in the sense of norm in $L_2([t, T]^k),$ $k=1, \ldots, 4.$ The mean-square convergence of the second part is proven on the base of generalized repeated Fourier series, converging pointwise. At that, we do not use iterated Ito stochastic integrals as a tool of the proof and directly consider iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals. The cases of multiple Fourier-Legendre series and multiple trigonometric Fourier series are considered in details. The considered expansions contain only one operation of the limit transition in contrast to its existing analogues. This property is very important for the mean-square approximation of iterated stochastic integrals. The results of the article can be applied to numerical integration of Ito stochastic differential equations.;math.PR
1801.05655;Rate-Distortion Performance of Sequential Massive Random Access to Gaussian Sources with Memory;In Sequential Massive Random Access (SMRA), a set of correlated sources is jointly encoded and stored on a server, and clients want to access to only a subset of the sources. Since the number of simultaneous clients can be huge, the server is only authorized to extract a bitstream from the stored data: no re-encoding can be performed before the transmission of a request. In this paper, we investigate the SMRA performance of lossy source coding of Gaussian sources with memory. In practical applications such as Free Viewpoint Television, this model permits to take into account not only inter but also intra correlation between sources. For this model, we provide the storage and transmission rates that are achievable for SMRA under some distortion constraint, and we consider two particular examples of Gaussian sources with memory.;cs.IT
1801.05663;The scaling limit of the membrane model;On the integer lattice we consider the discrete membrane model, a random interface in which the field has Laplacian interaction. We prove that, under appropriate rescaling, the discrete membrane model converges to the continuum membrane model in $d\ge 2$. Namely, it is shown that the scaling limit in $d=2,\,3$ is a H\"older continuous random field, while in $d\ge 4$ the membrane model converges to a random distribution. As a by-product of the proof in $d=2,\,3$, we obtain the scaling limit of the maximum. This work complements the analogous results of Caravenna and Deuschel (2009) in $d=1$.;math.PR
1801.05669;Solving the triharmonic equation over multi-patch domains using isogeometric analysis;We present a framework for solving the triharmonic equation over bilinearly parameterized planar multi-patch domains by means of isogeometric analysis. Our approach is based on the construction of a globally $C^2$-smooth isogeometric spline space which is used as discretization space. The generated $C^2$-smooth space consists of three different types of isogeometric functions called patch, edge and vertex functions. All functions are entirely local with a small support, and numerical examples indicate that they are well-conditioned. The construction of the functions is simple and works uniformly for all multi-patch configurations. While the patch and edge functions are given by a closed form representation, the vertex functions are obtained by computing the null space of a small system of linear equations. Several examples demonstrate the potential of our approach for solving the triharmonic equation.;math.NA
1801.05674;On the injective dimension of the Jacobson radical;We conjecture that the injective dimension of the Jacobson radical equals the global dimension for Artin algebras. We provide a proof of this conjecture in case the Artin algebra has finite global dimension and in some other cases.;math.RT
1801.05676;A distribution approach to finite-size corrections in Bethe Ansatz solvable models;We present a new and efficient method for deriving finite-size effects in statistical physics models solvable by Bethe Ansatz. It is based on the study of the functional that maps a function to the sum of its evaluations over the Bethe roots. A simple and powerful constraint is derived when applying this functional to infinitely derivable test functions with compact support, that generalizes then to more general test functions. The method is presented in the context of the simple spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain for which we derive the finite-size corrections to leading eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian for any configuration of Bethe numbers with real Bethe roots. The expected results for the central charge and conformal dimensions are recovered.;math-ph
1801.05677;Eisenstein-Kronecker series via the Poincar&#xe9, bundle;A classical construction of Katz gives a purely algebraic construction of Eisenstein--Kronecker series using the Gau\ss--Manin connection on the universal elliptic curve. This approach gives a systematic way to study algebraic and $p$-adic properties of real-analytic Eisenstein series. In the first part of this paper we provide an alternative algebraic construction of Eisenstein--Kronecker series via the Poincar\'e bundle. Building on this, we give in the second part a new conceptional construction of Katz' two-variable $p$-adic Eisenstein measure through $p$-adic theta functions of the Poincar\'e bundle.;math.NT
1801.05679;Zonal and Associated Functions on $SO_{0}(p,q)$ Groups;Explicit expressions for associated spherical functions of $SO(p,q)$ matrix groups are obtained using a generalized hypergeometric series of two variables. In this paper, we present explicit expressions for zonal functions of de Sitter groups and the group of conformal invariance. Moreover, we present a theorem on the transformation of derivative of distributions, concentrated on smooth surfaces, with respect to infinite-dimensional Lie group $C^{\infty}\left(\mathbb{R^{\mathit{n}}},GL(n)\right)$.;math.CA
1801.05681;Mixed Delay Constraints in Wyner&#x27,s Soft-Handoff Network;Wyner's soft-handoff network with mixed delay constraints is considered when neighbouring receivers can cooperate over rate-limited links. Each source message is a combination of independent "fast" and "slow" bits, where the former are subject to a stringent decoding delay. Inner and outer bounds on the capacity region are derived, and the multiplexing gain region is characterized when only transmitters or only receivers cooperate.;cs.IT
1801.05682;Automorphisms of Hilbert schemes of points on a generic projective K3 surface;We study automorphisms of the Hilbert scheme of $n$ points on a generic projective K3 surface $S$, for any $n \geq 2$. We show that the automorphism group of $S^{[n]}$ is either trivial or generated by a non-symplectic involution and we determine numerical and divisorial conditions which allow us to distinguish between the two cases. As an application of these results we prove that, for any $n \geq 2$, there exist infinite values for the degree of $S$ such that $S^{[n]}$ admits a non-natural involution. This provides a generalization of results by Boissi\`ere--Cattaneo--Nieper-Wisskirchen--Sarti for $n=2$.;math.AG
1801.05683;2-hom-associative bialgebras and hom-left symmetric dialgebras;From the definition and properties of unital hom-associative algebras, and the use of the Kaplansky's constructions, we develop new algebraic structures called 2-hom-associative bialgebras, 2-hom-bialgebras, and 2-2-hom-bialgebras. Besides, we devise a construction of hom-left symmetric dialgebras and discuss their main relevant properties.;math.RA
1801.05684;Eigenvector localization in the heavy-tailed random conductance model;We generalize our former localization result about the principal Dirichlet eigenvector of the i.i.d. heavy-tailed random conductance Laplacian to the first $k$ eigenvectors. We overcome the complication that the higher eigenvectors have fluctuating signs by invoking the Bauer-Fike theorem to show that the $k$th eigenvector is close to the principal eigenvector of an auxiliary spectral problem.;math.PR
1801.05687;On the Finiteness of the Derived Equivalence Classes of some Stable Endomorphism Rings;We prove that the stable endomorphism rings of rigid objects in a suitable Frobenius category have only finitely many basic algebras in their derived equivalence class and that these are precisely the stable endomorphism rings of objects obtained by iterated mutation. The main application is to the Homological Minimal Model Programme. For a 3-fold flopping contraction $f \colon X \to \mathrm{Spec}\ R$, where $X$ has only Gorenstein terminal singularities, there is an associated finite dimensional algebra $A_{\mathrm{con}}$ known as the contraction algebra. As a corollary of our main result, there are only finitely many basic algebras in the derived equivalence class of $A_{\mathrm{con}}$ and these are precisely the contraction algebras of maps obtained by a sequence of iterated flops from $f$. This provides evidence towards a key conjecture in the area.;math.RT
1801.05696;Sampled-data implementation of derivative-dependent control using artificial delays;We study a sampled-data implementation of linear controllers that depend on the output and its derivatives. First, we consider an LTI system of relative degree $r\ge 2$ that can be stabilized using $r-1$ output derivatives. Then, we consider PID control of a second order system. In both cases, the Euler approximation is used for the derivatives giving rise to a delayed sampled-data controller. Given a derivative-dependent controller that stabilizes the system, we show how to choose the parameters of the delayed sampled-data controller that preserves the stability under fast enough sampling. The maximum sampling period is obtained from LMIs that are derived using the Taylor's expansion of the delayed terms with the remainders compensated by appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals. Finally, we introduce the event-triggering mechanism that may reduce the amount of sampled control signals used for stabilization.;math.OC
1801.05701;Unlikely intersections between isogeny orbits and curves;Fix an abelian variety $A_0$ and a non-isotrivial abelian scheme over a smooth irreducible curve, both defined over the algebraic numbers. Consider the union of all images of translates of a fixed finite-rank subgroup of $A_0$, also defined over the algebraic numbers, by abelian subvarieties of $A_0$ of codimension at least $k$ under all isogenies between $A_0$ and some fiber of the abelian scheme. We characterize the curves inside the abelian scheme which are defined over the algebraic numbers, dominate the base curve and potentially intersect this set in infinitely many points. Our proof follows the Pila-Zannier strategy.;math.NT
1801.05702;Geometric Inequalities on Riemannian and sub-Riemannian manifolds by heat semigroups techniques;In those lecture notes, we review some applications of heat semigroups methods in Riemannian and sub-Riemannian geometry. The notes contain parts of courses taught at Purdue University, Institut Henri Poincar\'e, Levico Summer School and Tata Institute.;math.DG
1801.05706;Stability of planar rarefaction wave to 3D full compressible Navier-Stokes equations;We prove the time-asymptotic stability toward planar rarefaction wave for the three-dimensional full compressible Navier-Stokes equations in an infinite long flat nozzle domain $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}^2$. Compared with one-dimensional case, the proof here is based on our new observations on the cancellations on the flux terms and viscous terms due to the underlying wave structures, which are crucial to overcome the difficulties due to the wave propagation along the transverse directions $x_2$ and $x_3$ and its interactions with the planar rarefaction wave in $x_1$ direction.;math.AP
1801.05710;First and second order Central Limit Theorems for the recursive computation of the invariant distribution of a Feller process;This paper studies the convergence of empirical measures of a stochastic approximation toward the invariant distribution of a Feller process. In particular, we provide a general and abstract approach to establish Central Limit Theorems (CLT) with given rate . Moreover, considering weighted empirical measures of a weak order two stochastic approximation, we show its second order convergence while the CLT for standard empirical measures has order one. We also propose various applications: First order CLT for the approximation of Markov Brownian diffusion stationary regimes with Euler scheme (where we recover existing results from literature) and second order CLT for the approximation of Brownian diffusion stationary regimes using Talay scheme (1990) of weak order two.;math.PR
1801.05711;Some integrals and series involving the Stieltjes constants;Inter alia, we present a Fourier series involving the generalised Stieltjes constants.;math.CA
1801.05714;A note about irreducibility of a resultant;We present a theorem about irreducibility of a polynomial that is the resultant of two others polynomials. The proof of this fact is based on the field theory. We also consider the converse theorem and some examples.;math.AC
1801.05715;Reconstruction of functions in principal shift-invariant subspaces of mixed Lebesgue spaces;In this paper, we discuss to the nonuniform sampling problem in principal shift-invariant subspaces of mixed Lebesgue spaces. We proposed a fast reconstruction algorithm which allows to exactly reconstruct the functions in the principal shift-invariant subspaces as long as the sampling set $X=\{(x_{j},y_{k}):k,j\in \mathbb{J}\}$ is sufficiently dense. Our results improve the result in \cite{LiLiu}.;math.FA
1801.05722;Heegaard Floer homology, degree-one maps and splicing knot complements;Let $K$ denote a knot inside the homology sphere $Y$ and $K'$ denote a knot inside a homology sphere $L$-space. Let $X=Y(K,K')$ denote the 3-manifold obtained by splicing the complements of $K$ and $K'$. We show that $\text{rank}(\widehat{HF}(X)) \ge \text{rank}(\widehat{HF}(Y))$.;math.GT
1801.05724;On an extremal property of Jordan algebras of Clifford type;If $V$ is a finite-dimensional unital commutative (maybe nonassociative) algebra carrying an associative positive definite bilinear form then there exist a nonzero idempotent $c\ne e$ ($e$ being the algebra unit) of the shortest possible length $|c|^2$. In particular, $|c|^2\le \frac12|e|^2$. We prove that the equality holds exactly when $V$ is a Jordan algebra of Clifford type.;math.RA
1801.05726;A Markov Process Approach to the asymptotic Theory of abstract Cauchy Problems driven by Poisson Processes;In this paper, we employ Markov process theory to prove asymptotic results for a class of stochastic processes which arise as solutions of a stochastic evolution inclusion and are given by the representation formula \begin{align*} \mathbb{X}_{x}(t)=\sum \limits_{m=0}\limits^{\infty}T((t-\alpha_{m})_{+})(x_{x,m})1\hspace{-0,9ex}1_{[\alpha_{m},\alpha_{m+1})}(t), \end{align*} where $(T(t))_{t \geq 0}$ is a (nonlinear) time-continuous, contractive semigroup acting on a separable Banach space $(V,||\cdot||_{V})$, $(\alpha_{m})_{m \in \mathbb{N}}$ is the sequence of arrival times of a homogeneous Poisson process, $x$ is a $V$-valued random variable and $(x_{x,m})_{m \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a recursively defined sequence of $V$-valued random variables, fulfilling $x_{x,0}=x$. It will be demonstrated that $\mathbb{X}_{x}$ is, under some distributional assumptions on the involved random variables, a time-continuous Markov process and that it obeys, under polynomial decay conditions on $T$, the strong law of large numbers (SLLN) and, if the decay rate is sufficiently fast, also the central limit theorem (CLT). Finally, we consider two examples: A nonlinear ordinary differential equation and the (weighted) $p$-Laplacian evolution equation for $p \in (2,\infty)$.;math.PR
1801.05729;Weak Mixing in Switched Systems;Given a switched system, we introduce weakly mixing sets of type 1, 2 and Xiong chaotic sets of type 1, 2 with respect to a given set and show that they are equivalent respectively.;math.DS
1801.05732;Homogeneous deformations of toric pairs;We extend the Altmann--Mavlyutov construction of homogeneous deformations of affine toric varieties to the case of toric pairs $(X, \partial X)$, where $X$ is an affine or projective toric variety and $\partial X$ is its toric boundary. As an application, we generalise a result due to Ilten to the case of Fano toric pairs.;math.AG
1801.05740;Effective sup-norm bounds on average for cusp forms of even weight;Let $\Gamma\subset\mathrm{PSL}_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ be a Fuchsian subgroup of the first kind acting on the upper half-plane $\mathbb{H}$. Consider the $d_{2k}$-dimensional space of cusp forms $\mathcal{S}_{2k}^{\Gamma}$ of weight $2k$ for $\Gamma$, and let $\{f_{1},\ldots,f_{d_{2k}}\}$ be an orthonormal basis of $\mathcal{S}_{2k}^{\Gamma}$ with respect to the Petersson inner product. In this paper we will give effective upper and lower bounds for the supremum of the quantity $S_{2k}^{\Gamma}(z):=\sum_{j=1}^{d_{2k}}\vert f_{j}(z)\vert^{2}\,\mathrm{Im}(z)^{2k}$ as $z$ ranges through $\mathbb{H}$.;math.NT
1801.05748;Supersimple omega-categorical theories and pregeometries;We prove that if $T$ is an $\omega$-categorical supersimple theory with nontrivial dependence (given by forking), then there is a nontrivial regular 1-type over a finite set of reals which is realized by real elements, hence forking induces a nontrivial pregeometry on the solution set of this type and the pregeometry is definable (using only finitely many parameters). The assumption about $\omega$-categoricity is necessary. This result is used to prove the following: If $V$ is a finite relational vocabulary with maximal arity 3 and $T$ is a supersimple $V$-theory with elimination of quantifiers, then $T$ has trivial dependence and finite SU-rank. This immediately gives the following strengthening of a previous result of the author: if $\mathcal{M}$ is a ternary simple homogeneous structure with only finitely many constraints, then $Th(\mathcal{M})$ has trivial dependence and finite SU-rank.;math.LO
1801.05749;On Gaussian random matrices coupled to the discrete Laplacian;We study operators obtained by coupling an $n \times n$ random matrix from one of the Gaussian ensembles to the discrete Laplacian. We find the joint distribution of the eigenvalues and resonances of such operators. This is one of the possible mathematical models for quantum scattering in a complex physical system with one semi-infinite lead attached.;math-ph
1801.05751;On the equidistribution of some Hodge loci;We prove the equidistribution of the Hodge locus for certain non-isotrivial, polarized variations of Hodge structure of weight $2$ with $h^{2,0}=1$ over complex, quasi-projective curves. Given some norm condition, we also give an asymptotic on the growth of the Hodge locus. In particular, this implies the equidistribution of elliptic fibrations in quasi-polarized, non-isotrivial families of $K3$ surfaces.;math.AG
1801.05753;The Lipman-Zariski conjecture in low genus;We prove the Lipman-Zariski conjecture for complex surface singularities of genus one, and also for those of genus two whose link is not a rational homology sphere. As an application, we characterize complex $2$-tori as the only normal compact complex surfaces whose smooth locus has trivial tangent bundle. We also deduce that all complex-projective surfaces with locally free and generically nef tangent sheaf are smooth, and we classify them.;math.AG
1801.05758;On Grothendieck&#x27,s section conjecture for orbicurves;As already noted by Niels Borne and Michel Emsalem, there is a natural generalization of the section conjecture for proper orbicurves. Combined with the reformulation by Niels Borne and Angelo Vistoli of the conjecture in terms of the \'etale fundamental gerbe, this suggests an even stronger conjecture for orbicurves, asking an equivalence of categories instead of a mere bijection. We prove that the three versions of the conjecture are in fact equivalent, and that "injectivity" (i.e. full faithfulness) holds in the case of orbicurves. As a byproduct, we obtain a new proof of the fact that the section conjecture for proper curves implies the section conjecture for open curves.;math.AG
1801.05762;Heights in families of abelian varieties and the Geometric Bogomolov Conjecture;On an abelian scheme over a smooth curve over $\overline{\mathbb Q}$ a symmetric relatively ample line bundle defines a fiberwise N\'eon-Tate height. If the base curve is inside a projective space, we also have a height on its $\overline{\mathbb Q}$-points that serves as a measure of each fiber, an abelian variety. Silverman proved an asymptotic equality between these two heights on a curve in the abelian scheme. In this paper we prove an inequality between these heights on a subvariety of any dimension of the abelian scheme. As an application we prove the Geometric Bogomolov Conjecture for the function field of a curve defined over $\overline{\mathbb Q}$. Using Moriwaki's height we sketch how to extend our result when the base field of the curve has characteristic 0.;math.NT
